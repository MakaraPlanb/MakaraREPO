00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 48</i>

3
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
I wanted to pass
this position to Elder Luo.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
Brother Liu, why did you stop me?

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,960
If I didn’t stop you,

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,679
I’d have to see you
bang your head on the wall,

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,564
put a Loveless Curse on yourself,
and pretend to be the Star of Mosha

8
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:54,079
until you’re half-dead.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,359
Now, I even have to see you
pass all your duties to someone

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,359
and find a place to die alone.

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Isn’t that what you’re
thinking, Little Phoenix?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,520
The power of the divine weapons
are raging within me.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,719
I don’t know how long I can last.

14
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,399
So, you’re worried that you might
succumb to the divine weapons’ powers,

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,599
and the powers would
render you into pieces.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,279
Even when you die, the divine weapons
may fall into the wrong hands

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,479
and cause the soul of
Star of Mosha to be released.

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,399
By then, Xuan Ji will become
Asura zombie herself.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,679
That’s why you have
to stay away from Xuan Ji

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
even when you die, right?

21
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:40,599
Fine.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,479
While I was tidying up just now,

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,519
I found a Heartless Pill
left by your father.

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,519
Since you’re letting go of her,

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,479
you should take this pill
to end this once and for all.

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,640
You can start again.

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,639
No, no.

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
No!

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,799
Xuan Ji.

30
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,439
Xuan Ji, you’re awake.
How are you feeling?

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Stinky woman.

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Why...

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
Wasn’t I at the secret ground

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,999
destroying the soul of Star of Mosha?

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,999
- Why am I...
- You passed out from exhaustion.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
Father has resealed the Jade Cup.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,960
Was it Father who resealed it?

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Why do I recall

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,159
seeing Si Feng?

40
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,279
Why, you must be confused.

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,839
You fainted at the secret ground
and Father resealed the Jade Cup.

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,319
Then, Flying Snake brought you out.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,599
Ask him if you don’t believe me.

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,920
Right, Flying Snake?

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Is that what happened?

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,570
Don’t you even know what you’ve seen?

47
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,559
I was probably hallucinating.

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Xuan Ji.

49
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,959
Father and I didn’t know

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,679
that destroying the contents
of the Jade Cup would cost your life.

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,039
Had we known that,
we wouldn’t have let you go.

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,199
Promise me this.

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,079
Don’t neglect your well-being, okay?

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,159
Yes, and I need to tell you this.

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,279
You can’t destroy
the soul of Star of Mosha.

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,559
Senior Hao Chen got it all wrong.

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Don’t do this again, got it?

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
He got it wrong?

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,080
Little Fox.

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
Where’s my booze?

61
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
Little Fox.

62
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Little Fox.

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,160
Little Fox.

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Marvelous wine!

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,479
One jar isn’t enough.

66
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,679
It’s not? There’s more
in Lize Palace’s cellars.

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,279
Little Si Feng brought
the palace’s disciples away,

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
and the demons in Sky Hall are gone.

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,120
You have more than enough wine
to last you for your entire life.

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,720
That would be wonderful.

71
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Little Fox.

72
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,279
Don’t you find Si Feng weird?

73
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,240
You see, he finally made it back
here, and he’s already occupied.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,719
It’s not easy to be a human or a demon.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,199
That’s why you should
live happily and freely.

76
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,479
Why must you care so much
about other people’s feelings?

77
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,119
And he just had to choose
something no one would do

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,319
until he’s miserable and glum.

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,079
I don’t understand him.

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,640
Yes, you won’t understand him.

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,960
After all, freedom
matters the most to you.

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
You’ll never understand.

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,119
For some humans and demons,

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,920
there are things more
important than freedom.

85
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,440
So what if it brings misery?

86
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,760
He did so willingly.

87
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,319
We’re missing some food
to go with the wine.

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,080
I’m going to get some food.

89
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,279
Stinky woman, why are you here again?

90
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Are you still trying to destroy
the soul of Star of Mosha?

91
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,119
Before Senior Hao Chen died,

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,359
he kept reminding me
to destroy the Jade Cup.

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,359
But I haven’t done so yet.

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,199
And I don’t know why, but
the more I want to destroy it,

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
the more my heart aches.

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,879
And I think I saw

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,960
the moment when the soul of
Star of Mosha was taken out.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
You saw it?

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,759
It wasn’t clear.

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,120
I only saw some shadows.

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,479
But I can clearly feel

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,840
the pain when the Star of Mosha
had his soul ripped off.

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
How strange.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,520
Maybe it’s because you’re
somehow connected to him.

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,120
Is it because I killed the Star
of Mosha and sealed his soul?

106
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,840
But I don’t think that’s the case.

107
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,600
Or, perhaps the Star of Mosha
has possessed my mind.

108
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
I think I dreamed about Si Feng.

109
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,399
Perhaps I wasn’t strong enough.

110
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,079
That’s why I couldn’t fulfill
Senior Hao Chen’s wish.

111
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,799
As long as the soul of
Star of Mosha remains,

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
the three realms will remain threatened.

113
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,959
I’m going to try again.

114
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,239
No, you can’t.

115
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,559
You’ll die.

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,999
You’ll die, get it?

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,160
Sacrificing for the people is my destiny.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,235
Besides, I don’t want Si Feng
to become the demon lord.

119
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,559
Who told you Si Feng
would become the demon lord?

120
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,359
Who said you have to die
to save the world?

121
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,519
Destiny, you say?

122
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,367
I thought you never believed in destiny.

123
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:42,439
So, your senior blurted
some nonsense before he died,

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,798
and you’re going to bang
your head on the wall?

125
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,840
Flying Snake!

126
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,439
I am just speaking the truth.

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,199
Your senior is dead.

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,879
Does that make his words truthful?

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,959
Well, the soul of Star of Mosha
has not been released,

130
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,999
but even if the soul returns to its body,

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,519
will he really go on a killing spree
in the three realms

132
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
and endanger the people?

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,400
Is there something you know?

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,639
I only know that

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,799
the story about the Star of Mosha
ending the world is just speculation.

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,559
No one knows what
the Star of Mosha would do.

137
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,039
Not even the Jade Emperor knows!

138
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,839
The Star of Mosha
hasn’t done anything yet.

139
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,664
Why is he seen as the doom of the world

140
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,358
and sentenced to eternal damnation?

141
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,599
Why are you sacrificing yourself

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
for something that hasn’t happened yet?

143
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,589
Your senior must have
told you to take precautions

144
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,519
and end everything before it
starts, even if it’s very likely that

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,120
it won’t even happen.

146
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,839
But Senior Hao Chen always said that

147
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,320
the appearance of the Star of Mosha
is sure to bring disaster.

148
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
He’s just using your trust to make
you do the things he deemed right!

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,359
Xuan Ji, the Jade Cup has been resealed.

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,600
There’s no danger anymore, so...

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,879
Flying Snake.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
Is my father really capable

153
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,840
of sealing the Jade Cup?

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,360
I must see for myself.

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Forget it.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,439
Why keep it a secret?

157
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,800
She has to know someday.

158
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
What is this?

159
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,799
Isn’t this the seal of
the Rose Gold Bird?

160
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,239
You almost perished with
the soul of Star of Mosha.

161
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,399
It was him who saved you

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,999
and depleted all his powers
to reseal the Jade Cup.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,799
That was a huge blow to his health.

164
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,760
Everyone hopes you won’t know about this,

165
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,760
Si Feng included.

166
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,080
So it wasn’t a dream.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,520
But why did he do that?

168
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,799
Isn’t he the Star of Mosha?

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,440
Wouldn’t he want to open the Jade Cup?

170
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
I am not the Star of Mosha.

171
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I have never harmed anyone.

172
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,708
I am here today to kill Yuan Lang.

173
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:06,920
Shut up!

174
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Si Feng!

175
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
No.

176
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,559
He killed my master.

177
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,639
He killed Senior Hao Chen.

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,999
He injured Aunt Ying Hong.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,880
But no one has ever
seen him in action, right?

180
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,120
I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

181
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,639
But it’s a fact that
he’s not the Star of Mosha.

182
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,239
He pretended to be the Star of Mosha
to remove Yuan Lang from the picture.

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,279
After all, our biggest threat

184
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,800
isn’t the unseen Star of Mosha,
but the nefarious Yuan Lang.

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,359
Is that so?

186
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,804
So, which part of him convinced you
that he’s the Star of Mosha?

187
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,089
He took down our biggest enemy

188
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,279
and risked his life
to reseal the Jade Cup.

189
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
The Jade Cup is stable now.

190
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
I don’t know.

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I think there are many things
that you will have to clarify.

192
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,479
- Father.
- What are you doing here now?

193
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,724
I need to go to Lize Palace.

194
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,245
I need to ask Si Feng something.

195
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,799
No need.

196
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,599
They have left their palace.

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,679
I’ve asked Min Xing to scout around.

198
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,199
All the barriers surrounding
Lize Palace have been removed.

199
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,039
Only an empty palace remains.

200
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,399
All the Rose Gold Bird Demons
are missing now.

201
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
I don’t know if Lize Palace

202
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,399
is truly giving up or hiding
themselves to plot a bigger conspiracy.

203
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,560
Then I have to go there!

204
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Master.

205
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,959
Master.

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,999
A disciple saw Wu Tong
around Mount Buzhou.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
Wu Tong?

208
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,399
Did Yu Si Feng bring his horde
of demons back to Mount Buzhou?

209
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,919
Keep a closer eye on him.

210
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,239
Remember, Ling Long
must not know about this.

211
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,119
Well... Ling Long has left.

212
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,399
She said she wants
to kill Wu Tong herself.

213
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,999
What? That’s preposterous!

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,599
She is no match for Wu Tong!

215
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,719
Father, don’t worry,
I’ll bring Ling Long back here.

216
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,359
She couldn’t have reached
Mount Buzhou by now.

217
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,479
Maybe not.

218
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,679
Min Yan left a Black and White Ring
on Wu Tong back then.

219
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,440
That means she can access
Mount Buzhou easily.

220
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Let go of me!

221
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
You’re finally here.

222
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,880
I’ve been waiting for you.

223
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,520
I’ve been wandering around
Mount Buzhou for the past few days.

224
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I knew

225
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,680
you’d come when you know that I’m here.

226
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,520
Your face tells me that

227
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,120
Zhong Min Yan is dead.

228
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
He won’t die.

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,640
Only you will.

230
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,239
To think you’re here for me
even when he’s not dead yet.

231
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,400
Are you so eager to see me?

232
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,240
After all, we used to be
so happy together.

233
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,080
You only cared about me.

234
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
No one but me.

235
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,280
You’d whisper sweet nothings
into my ears every day.

236
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,640
That wasn’t... That wasn’t me!

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,360
What’s the point of denying the truth?

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,959
You still can’t escape from my hands.

239
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,080
Aren’t you right beside me now?

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
I’m going to make you
wear a bridal veil today

241
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
and marry you.

242
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
Don’t rush.

243
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,999
When our bridal room is ready,

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,840
we have enough time to spend
the rest of our lives together.

245
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Wu Tong.

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,680
Today is the day you die.

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,840
There’s a Lightning Formation
under your feet.

248
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,240
Do you think a mere
Lightning Formation can kill me?

249
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes, a normal formation is nothing to you.

250
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,040
But what if I sacrifice myself

251
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
to summon a Thunderous Calamity?

252
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Wu Tong.

253
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,119
Judging from our powers,

254
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,320
a Thunderous Calamity
should be enough to reduce us to ashes.

255
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,959
You’re going to die!

256
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
You...

257
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,119
Don’t you dare go anywhere.

258
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,800
Are you taking yourself down too
just to kill me?

259
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Fine.

260
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,839
That’s fair enough.

261
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,480
Since I can’t be with you in this life,

262
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,320
I’m satisfied enough to die with you.

263
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
A Thunderous Calamity?
Something is up.

264
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,760
Keep your guard up, the gate is opening.

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,565
Look!

266
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,599
Who’s there?

267
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,680
Forget about that, let’s go!

268
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,590
- Lord Flying Snake.
- Lord Flying Snake.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,079
It’s me.

270
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,800
Surprised? Happy to see me?

271
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,799
Shen Shu, Yu Lu.

272
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,160
Are you two up for a round
of entertainment with me?

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,639
A Thunderous Calamity.

274
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,759
Ling Long!

275
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Ling Long!

276
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,799
Ling Long!

277
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,120
- Xuan Ji.
- Let’s go.

278
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,679
Ling Long, why did you do this?

279
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,720
Hadn’t I made it here in time, you’d be...

280
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,760
Why did you do this?

281
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,960
Are you leaving me and Father behind?

282
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,239
What about Sixth Senior?

283
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,920
Don’t you care about him anymore?

284
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Min Yan...

285
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,680
He probably won’t wake up anymore.

286
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,160
We vowed to live and die together,

287
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,520
so this is just another means to do so.

288
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Live together...

289
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,519
The sword pierced
through his heart meridian.

290
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,720
Any normal human
would have died on the spot.

291
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,239
Everything is predestined,
force does you no good.

292
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,559
I’m still going to force it.

293
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,839
I must save him.

294
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,719
As long as a shred of hope remains,
I must save him.

295
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,719
If he lives, that will be wonderful.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,279
If he doesn’t, I will die with him.

297
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
But what am I doing now?

298
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Wu Tong.

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,159
Let’s settle our scores once and for all.

300
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,239
Where are your men?

301
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,360
Where are the demons in
Sky Hall and Lize Palace?

302
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,559
I thought your lover, Yu Si Feng,
disbanded the demons in Sky Hall.

303
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,919
Yuan Lang plotted for thousands of years

304
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,319
to throw the three realms into chaos,

305
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,839
and Yu Si Feng stopped his plans.

306
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,400
Didn’t you know?

307
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,479
You’re a clever lady, God of War.

308
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,280
Even when Yu Si Feng
is the Star of Mosha,

309
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,679
he wouldn’t open the Jade Cup.

310
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,999
He would rather
end his life to be with you.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lies!

312
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Ling Long.

313
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,120
What Wu Tong said

314
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
is the same as Flying Snake’s speculation.

315
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,599
Did Si Feng do all that
because of Yuan Lang?

316
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Don’t tell me

317
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240
we’ve misunderstood Si Feng all this time.

318
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,879
Tell me.

319
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,439
Where are Si Feng and his followers?

320
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,759
How would I know?

321
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,119
He wants to kill me,
I should be avoiding him.

322
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,920
But why are you in the dark too?

323
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,040
Didn’t he look for you?

324
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,160
Don’t tell me that
when he killed Yuan Lang,

325
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,280
he killed himself as well.

326
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,119
Perhaps living as a murderous
Demon Lord means nothing.

327
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
When you don’t have
that one person you want,

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
everything is dull.

329
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,720
I’m killing you today!

330
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Ling Long!

331
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,199
What’s going on?

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,439
Two humans are fighting in Mount
Buzhou, so are you dazed or blind?

333
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I...

334
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,639
If I were you, I would have
ignored these two humans, me

335
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,239
and the God of War herself

336
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,719
so I wouldn’t have to report
to the heavens

337
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,279
about you neglecting your duties.

338
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,560
What do you say?

339
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,520
Isn’t killing me enough
to appease your anger?

340
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,040
You deserve to be cut into pieces!

341
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,000
You look nice even when you hate me.

342
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,200
Why do I only understand now
that what I want

343
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,600
is not eradicating the sects

344
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,320
or taking revenge on everyone, but

345
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,680
having you look at me.

346
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,120
Since the first time I met you,

347
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,000
I’ve always wanted

348
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
to attract your gaze.

349
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,679
My lord, the gate
to Fenru City is wide open.

350
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,079
If they don’t leave now,

351
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,199
they will be sucked into
the oblivion of Fenru City

352
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,560
or even stuck there forever.

353
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,240
That’s it?

354
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Oh no.

355
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,440
Let go of me!

356
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,239
Wu Tong, let go of me!

357
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,520
Let go of me!

358
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
Let go of me!

359
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,720
Let go of me!

360
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,280
Let go of me!

361
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
Let go of me, Wu Tong!

362
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,680
I’ve never understood
the meaning of life.

363
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,680
I was fixated on taking revenge.

364
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,479
Now that I’m dying, I finally understand.

365
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,119
- Let go!
- I’ve always wanted you.

366
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,119
Let go of me, I’m not dying with you!

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,240
Let go of me!

368
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,240
Let go of me, I’m not dying with you!

369
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,680
Stinky woman.

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Let go of me!

371
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Ling Long!

372
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,519
Xuan Ji!

373
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,559
Xuan Ji!

374
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
- Xuan Ji!
- Ling Long.

375
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
Xuan Ji!

376
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,759
Why aren’t you crying, miss?

377
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,920
Don’t you have something
you’re holding onto?

378
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,480
What’s there to hold onto?

379
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,840
I had nothing but a boring life.

380
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Forget it.

381
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,800
You should forget it.

382
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,200
It’s the River of Forgetting.

383
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,400
That was Si Feng.

384
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,560
You’re weird for a music instructor.

385
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,800
Are you in love with me?

386
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
I...

387
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,199
I have never seen love.

388
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,319
And I don’t believe love exists.

389
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
You said you don’t believe in love.

390
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,520
This time,
I’ll take this gamble for myself.

391
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
I’m betting you.

392
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,800
Let’s see if you’ll remember me.

393
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
How will you know?

394
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,880
By seeking this drop of blood
so you can ask me after you die?

395
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,639
You have committed treason
by owning private troops

396
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,719
and engaging in nepotism.

397
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,119
Am I supposed
to cover for you, Prince Xin?

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,680
I conquered the kingdom,

399
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
consolidated your power

400
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,360
and protected the nation for you.

401
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
In the end,

402
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,040
one word from you
nullifies everything I did.

403
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,280
Thy name is unpredictable.

404
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,960
Your Majesty, I hope

405
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
you will trust those who can be trusted,

406
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,000
or else it will be miserable for you.

407
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,680
I will give you

408
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,360
everything you want.

409
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,159
Are you really giving me your eyes
even when it’s forbidden?

410
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,560
You are born in a family of sorcerers.

411
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,200
If you can’t study spells and
become a full-fledged sorceress,

412
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,040
you will be burned.

413
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,159
I don’t want to see you die.

414
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,240
Even if that’s the case,

415
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,719
I won’t remember you.

416
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
I just want you to live to your fullest.

417
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Don’t worry.

418
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,000
I will find a far place to die.

419
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,520
We will not meet again in this life.

420
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
I see you as my confidant.

421
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,359
Why do you want to kill me?

422
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,919
Someone is paying me for your life.

423
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,280
When you die, I will be free.

424
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Why?

425
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,560
I hope that after I die,

426
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,960
you won’t forget about me.

427
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
Dream on.

428
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,920
Why should I remember you?

429
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,799
So that’s what he meant when he said
I hurt him for the past nine lives.

430
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,120
To think I even guaranteed
I’d treat him differently this life.

431
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,560
Yet I disappointed him again.

432
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,999
No, I can’t continue wallowing in here.

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,960
I need to get answers from Si Feng!

434
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,999
You hate the heavens
for wrecking your life.

435
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,799
All you have in your mind
is revenge, right?

436
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,840
Do you think I’ll forgive the heavens

437
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,279
for doing this to me?

438
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
Execute her!

439
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
That’s right.

440
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,040
You shouldn’t die here.

441
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,600
I shall bring you to Fenru City
so you can enter the mortal world.

442
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,519
Then, the heavens
cannot hurt you anymore.

443
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
No!

444
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,120
I’ll go with you.

445
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,920
I shall use my life to release you

446
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,000
from your pain and anger

447
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,920
and make up for the wrongs
the heavens has done to you.

448
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Si Feng.

449
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Si Feng!

450
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,200
Stinky woman, are you okay?

451
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
How are you feeling?

452
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,799
Tell me.

453
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,320
When can I finally retire from war?

454
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,520
So he has always been with me.

455
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,799
He has been with me
since I was in the heavens.

456
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,519
Yet he gave everything up

457
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,599
to redeem me through
ten lives in the mortal world.

458
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,480
I was the one who dragged him down.

459
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,520
And not only did I forget
everything, I hurt him time and again.

460
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,159
What are you thinking about?

461
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,320
I saw everything.

462
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,519
When I was relegated
to the mortal world,

463
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,719
it was King Bailing
who erased all my memories.

464
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,919
Even the Mirror of Origin
couldn’t show me my memories.

465
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,399
Why did he do that?

466
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,920
The heavens has
its own way of doing things.

467
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,759
They have their considerations.

468
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,000
Considerations?

469
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,880
I am just a toy for those
in the heavens.

470
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,799
Let’s not talk about this now.

471
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,240
Didn’t you see anything else down there?

472
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,000
Si Feng.

473
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:07,951
Si Feng.

474
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
Si Feng.

475
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,000
I saw it.

476
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,278
When I was in the heavens
and the mortal world,

477
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:20,239
even when I was utterly
betrayed and abandoned,

478
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,200
only Si Feng gave me his all to help me.

479
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,240
How would a person like him
ever betray me?

480
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Flying Snake.

481
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,520
I was wrong.

482
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,600
I have been wrong all along, right?

483
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,933
By the way, when I sent Ling Long
back to Shaoyang Sect,

484
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,007
I met Ting Nu.

485
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,470
He said it was Si Feng who told
him to come to save Zhong Min Yan.

486
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,758
Then Ting Nu knows where Si Feng is.

487
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,040
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

488
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,039
Little Six.

489
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,239
Little Six.

490
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Ling Long.

491
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
I knew you wouldn’t leave me.

492
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,759
Even if you’re abandoning me,
I’ll look for you in heaven and hell.

493
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,599
I haven’t married my wife yet.

494
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,680
I’m not going anywhere.

495
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
What happened?

496
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,080
I went to Mount Buzhou
to confront Wu Tong.

497
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,079
He’s dead now.

498
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,999
Our nightmare has ended.

499
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,240
I won’t do anything silly again.

500
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,720
Everything is over now.

501
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,479
My wife, I have never felt
that you’re silly.

502
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
You’re the silly guy here!

503
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,039
Sixth Senior.

504
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Xuan Ji.

505
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,159
Flying Snake said you’re fine,

506
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,600
but I can only be relieved
when I see you myself.

507
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,959
I’m fine.

508
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,239
I’m also glad that
Sixth Senior is safe now.

509
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,319
All of you keep giving me headaches.

510
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,960
Behave yourselves from now on.

511
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,560
Min Yan, take care.

512
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,399
I owe you yet another favor.

513
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,720
I am truly grateful.

514
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,839
No need to thank me.

515
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,880
I came here on behalf of a friend.

516
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Ting Nu.

517
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,000
Do you mean Si Feng?

518
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,559
Other than saving your Sixth Senior,

519
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,359
he also had two other requests for me.

520
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,719
First, he wants me to inform you

521
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,079
that the Sky Hall demons have disbanded.

522
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,439
He has no control over the demons anymore.

523
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,703
But he can guarantee that
the Rose Gold Bird

524
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:10,800
will never engage in battle with
the mortals and cultivation sects.

525
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,519
Mere words do not mean much.

526
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,240
Yes, only time will tell.

527
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Second, he asked me to
give this pill to Elder Chu.

528
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,519
This pill is rare indeed.

529
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,480
It can rebuild your health so you
can regain your spiritual powers.

530
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,560
Everyone, I shall take my leave.

531
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,559
Auntie Ying Hong.

532
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,759
Don’t be angry.

533
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,479
I just want to ask you

534
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,680
if you have clearly seen
the person who injured you.

535
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,320
To be frank, I did not
see my attacker clearly.

536
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,479
I only know he must be from Lize Palace.

537
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,000
Back then, only Yu Si Feng was there.

538
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,999
No.

539
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,439
Ruo Yu was also there.

540
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,879
Si Feng said that he was
trapped within the barriers

541
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,600
when he was pursuing Ruo Yu.

542
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,919
Back then, we didn’t believe him.

543
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,119
But when Wu Tong attacked
our sect, I saw Ruo Yu.

544
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,559
And he admitted to
me that he was the one

545
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,520
who injured Auntie Ying Hong
and trespassed the secret ground.

546
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,680
Si Feng wasn’t lying.

547
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,879
I misunderstood him.

548
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,199
So, what Wu Tong said
before he died was true.

549
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,839
Si Feng never intended
to unseal the Jade Cup

550
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,040
to wreak havoc upon the three realms.

551
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,519
Everything he did was to
destroy Yuan Lang’s plot.

552
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
He...

553
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,239
Si Feng said he’s not the Star of Mosha.

554
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,319
But I never believed him.

555
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,959
He said he’d handle everything
and answer me one day.

556
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,279
But I only believed in what I saw.

557
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,159
I didn’t listen to his explanation.

558
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,599
- I was even angry...
- Xuan Ji.

559
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,360
I was angry that he deceived
me and went against my wishes.

560
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:03,320
Ting Nu.

561
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:06,273
Ting Nu!

562
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,919
You knew Xuan Ji’s senior
wasn’t killed by Si Feng.

563
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,080
Why didn’t you tell them?

564
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Easy of you to say, but what about me?

565
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,360
My celestial eye saw it.

566
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,319
It was the Asura form of Yuan
Lang who killed Xuan Ji’s senior.

567
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,119
Little Phoenix was there to save him.

568
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
In the end, he was betrayed instead.

569
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,359
For whom did he did that?

570
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,720
That stupid girl, of course.

571
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,199
He ran all the way there
to save her senior,

572
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,159
and now he’s slapped with
a baseless accusation.

573
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,800
No one will believe me now.

574
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,879
Chu Xuan Ji’s senior was a scoundrel.

575
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,279
What a weird guy he was.

576
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,759
He knew very well that
he was attacked by Yuan Lang.

577
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,840
But he put the blame on Little Phoenix.

578
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,597
I now see that those unreasonable
barbarians in Shaoyang Sect

579
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,438
are trying to pin Little Phoenix down!

580
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Brother Liu!

581
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,680
Brother Liu, what did you say?

582
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
You heard everything?

583
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,800
Is it important anyway?

584
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,400
Little Phoenix is being maligned now.

585
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,159
- Are you happy?
- Yi Huan.

586
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,360
Is it true that Si Feng
didn’t kill my senior?

587
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,960
You saw it?

588
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,799
What is this?

589
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,600
Not only did I see it, I
saw it as clear as day.

590
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,559
Then why did my senior malign Si Feng?

591
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,879
How would I know?

592
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,360
Don’t you know how prejudiced
your senior is towards demons?

593
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,399
He probably just wanted
to harm as many demons as he could.

594
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,759
Let’s go, Ting Nu.

595
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,239
What a lousy place this is.

596
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,719
If it weren’t for Si Feng’s request,

597
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,919
I wouldn’t have come here
for the rest of my life.

598
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,319
- Brother Liu.
- Yi Huan.

599
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,119
Tell me where Si Feng is.

600
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,320
You care about him?

601
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,759
Lize Palace is empty now.

602
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,239
The Rose Gold Bird have decided
to disappear from the mortal world.

603
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,079
I don’t know where they are either.

604
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,079
It’s good anyway. At least you people
won’t pester them anymore.

605
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,039
They left? Why?

606
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,320
Did Si Feng leave too?

607
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
Doesn’t he care about me anymore?

608
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,479
Isn’t that good?

609
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,359
I was blind enough to unite you two.

610
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,679
Yu Si Feng’s Loveless Curse
has activated twice.

611
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,359
The third time will mean death.

612
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,319
Ending this relationship
will keep his life.

613
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,319
Loveless Curse? What is that?

614
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,760
Why is it that I don’t know
anything about it?

615
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,719
You don’t know anything.

616
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,440
And you’re still asking why.

617
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,319
Let’s go, Ting Nu.

618
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,559
Yi Huan.

619
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,640
Just tell Xuan Ji everything you know.

620
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Even if they have to part,
let’s make this a clean cut.

621
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,759
Fine, I’ll tell you.

622
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,160
I’ll tell you what Yu Si Feng
has done for you.

623
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,720
The Loveless Mask is the most
brutal torture in Lize Palace.

624
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,319
When people meet
the love of their lives,

625
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,440
they would rather kill themselves
than wear the Loveless Mask.

626
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,999
That’s because any feelings of love

627
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,800
will cause an irremovable mask to form.

628
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Three letdowns in love
will end the wearer’s life.

629
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,479
Little Phoenix couldn’t bear
to leave you alone.

630
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,320
He was locked up and tortured in
Lianyu Pagoda for an entire year.

631
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,519
In the end, your indifference towards him

632
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,520
made him wear the Loveless
Mask so he can be free.

633
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,199
After he was released,
he was supposed to stay away from you.

634
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,399
But you kept clinging onto him.

635
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Si Feng.

636
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:30,160
Si Feng, it really is you.

637
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,839
You have another new mask.

638
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,640
I almost couldn’t recognize you.

639
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,159
Little Phoenix was unlucky
enough to believe that

640
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,759
you would be different.

641
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
He thought you would treat him sincerely.

642
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,839
He thought you would
remove that mask for him.

643
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,000
He thought you could
lift his Loveless Curse.

644
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,959
But fate was cruel,
and you just had to be the God of War.

645
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,879
The Loveless Mask is made from
wood from Kunlun Tree.

646
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,079
It cannot resist your celestial powers.

647
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,960
You removed his mask easily,

648
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,600
but you couldn’t lift his curse.

649
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Si Feng.

650
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:05,599
Si Feng.

651
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,359
- At first...
- Si Feng!

652
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,999
He didn’t expect anything from you
or feel anything for you.

653
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
That’s how the curse can be suppressed.

654
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,200
But he still dedicated himself to you.

655
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,960
That punk must have been so
determined to give his life to you.

656
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,600
Didn’t you say that the mask
will smile when it’s removed?

657
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,880
Why is it crying?

658
00:43:29,928 --> 00:43:30,928
Xuan Ji.

659
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,560
Were you really the one
who removed this mask?

660
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Yes.

661
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,200
Si Feng!

662
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,480
I was wrong, Si Feng.

663
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,199
Yu Si Feng’s Loveless Curse
has activated twice.

664
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,079
The third time will mean death.

665
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,279
Ending this relationship
will keep his life.

666
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Stinky woman!

667
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,079
Stinky woman, what are you doing?

668
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,159
Lize Palace is here!

669
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,560
You almost dived straight into the sea!

670
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
That’s right.

671
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
What...

672
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,400
What have I been doing?

673
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,520
He tried to explain to me
about what he had done,

674
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,159
but I never listened a single word.

675
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,240
I even said all those hurtful remarks.

676
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,719
He didn’t tell you,
so you didn’t know.

677
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,840
It’s not your fault.

678
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
No.

679
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,960
No matter what happens to me,

680
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,280
he would know even
when I don’t tell him.

681
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,320
But what about me?

682
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
I...

683
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,440
I never cared about what he wanted.

684
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,680
I never knew if he was happy or sad.

685
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,360
He said I’m heartless.

686
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,280
I am truly heartless.

687
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,680
Now...

688
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,920
He’s gone.

689
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
Lize Palace is abandoned now.

690
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,320
He has moved on indeed.
