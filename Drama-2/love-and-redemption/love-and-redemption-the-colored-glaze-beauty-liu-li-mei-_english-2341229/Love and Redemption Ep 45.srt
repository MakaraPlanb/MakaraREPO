00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,119
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,643
<i>EPISODE 45</i>

3
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,460
Where are you going?

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,660
To Lize Palace.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,799
I’m going to correct my past mistakes.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,082
Lize Palace is the nest of the demon clan.

7
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,079
Even if you have
the powers of the God of War,

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,140
you mustn’t go there alone.

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,900
Moreover, you don’t
need to go to Lize Palace

10
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,361
if you want to vanquish your inner demon.

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,628
Where should I go then?

12
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,009
The 15th day of the month is coming soon.

13
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,879
Fenru City’s gate will open by then.

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,579
Yu Si Feng will surely head to
Fenru City in order to save Wu Zhi Qi.

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,759
Only his 12 Feathers bloodline

16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,521
and the powers of God of War can withstand

17
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:18,945
the malignant aura within Demon Citadel.

18
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,105
So,

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,220
you’ll meet him if you go
to the Demon Citadel.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,900
By then, you will know that

21
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,715
he’s a devious demon

22
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,994
that’s trying to revive the demon clan.

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,559
Fine.

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,020
- I’ll meet him in the Demon Citadel.
- Wait.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,380
Yu Si Feng is devious and cunning.

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,340
Getting rid of him would be
the best-case scenario.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,370
But, in the event that
you couldn’t bear to kill him,

28
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,206
you should bring this with you.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,750
What is this?

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,879
This is Cleansing Bottle.

31
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,419
Master acquired this item
while he was traveling around the world.

32
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,240
It can get rid of one’s anguish.

33
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,549
If you could not bear to kill him,

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,573
you should use the Cleansing
Bottle and get rid of his anguish.

35
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:18,727
Although it won’t kill him,

36
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,391
it may help him
to find his conscience back.

37
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:24,370
It’s up to you whether to kill him

38
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,938
or use the Cleansing Bottle on him.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,820
I understand.

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,306
Xuan Ji.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,496
You’re the only person
I care about in this world.

42
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:49,677
You mustn’t be soft on him.

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,992
If you let Yu Si Feng save Wu Zhi Qi,

44
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,342
the demon clan will have
a huge boost in their morale.

45
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:58,420
They’ll be hard to deal with by then.

46
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,531
I won’t do so.

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,746
Xuan Ji.

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,060
I hope you will cherish
this last chance I’m giving you.

49
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,595
I hope you can get rid
of your inner demon.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,900
Father.

51
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,199
Ling Long?

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,591
Please wait for a while.

53
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:26,359
I have something to tell you
after I’m done with this.

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,620
It’s all right.
I’ll leave after I finish my words.

55
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,073
Tell me then.

56
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:35,881
I think

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,639
it’s time for me to leave.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,020
I’m here to bid farewell.

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,540
You two are leaving?

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,096
Did Min Yan

61
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,982
find a suitable place for you two?

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,293
This time,

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,420
I’m leaving alone.

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,940
You’re leaving alone?

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,599
What about Min Yan?

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,740
Did that silly child make you angry again?

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,820
No. It has nothing to do with him.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,140
I wanted to leave on my own.

69
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,180
I want to find a quiet place

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,153
and spend the rest of my life there.

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,820
Ling Long, do you know this?

72
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,019
Min Yan came to me today.

73
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,822
He came to me in the afternoon.

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,220
He told me that

75
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,382
he wanted to marry you.

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,398
You two,

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,839
one of you wanted to propose,
and one of you wanted to leave.

78
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,599
What are you two up to?

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,782
He wants to marry me?

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,999
Impossible.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,500
- He...
- Nothing is impossible.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,314
I want to marry you.

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,215
Master.

84
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,140
Why are you doing this?

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,820
Because you don’t believe
my feelings for you.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,540
Because you’re paranoid.

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,020
That’s why

88
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,580
I need to marry you.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,300
So that you won’t suspect my feelings.

90
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,541
I want to marry you.

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,786
You’re the only girl I would marry

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,539
in this life.

93
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,060
I’m not the old me anymore.

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,580
I am unworthy to marry you.

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,300
The past you?

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,794
Do you think the old you
is better than the current you?

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,500
You acted like a princess.

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,300
You were willful and you didn’t
care about the feelings of others.

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,660
That was the old you.

100
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,741
You’re not that great at all.

101
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,265
Why do you want to marry me then?

102
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,486
Because I like you.

103
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,163
No matter if it’s the old you,
current you, or future you.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,540
I like you no matter

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,300
who you become.

106
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,780
Nobody can take you away from me.

107
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,060
I, Zhong Min Yan,

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,740
have been loving Chu Ling Long
for 14 years.

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,146
I didn’t prepare the
Three Letters and Six Etiquettes,

110
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,447
and I didn’t hire any matchmaker.

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,420
I only have my true heart for her.

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,900
Master, please allow me
to marry Ling Long.

113
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,325
Here, I swear that I will never
let Ling Long cry or suffer again.

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,503
Master, please grant my wish.

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,079
Sure.

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,422
My child, you may rise now.

117
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,460
I’m happy to see you two tie the knot.

118
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,894
But now, Shaoyang Sect
will soon face our biggest threat.

119
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,399
I have no time to hold your wedding.

120
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,919
How about this?

121
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,734
You two should stay here
for a little longer.

122
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:24,479
After everything is over, I’ll hold
a glorious wedding for you two.

123
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,959
What do you think?

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,110
Master.

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,141
I don’t want to wait anymore.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,189
Ling Long will suffer

127
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,700
if we wait.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,980
I want to marry her as soon as possible

129
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,216
so that she can feel relieved.

130
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,678
But I’m afraid as well.

131
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,660
I don’t want Ling Long to suffer

132
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,820
because of a hasty wedding.

133
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
Not at all.

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,900
You suffered because of me in the past.

135
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,914
I’m happy if you can marry me right now.

136
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,993
Have you two

137
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,502
decided?

138
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,570
- Please give us your blessing.
- Please give us your blessing.

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,079
Sure!

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,307
This is great!

141
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,528
After five days,

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,761
I will... I will hold a wedding
for you two and Xuan Ji, okay?

143
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,719
Thank you, Master.

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,093
- This is?
- It’s malignant aura.

145
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:43,474
Such strong malignant aura.

146
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,435
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

147
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,119
It’s the malignant aura!

148
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,580
Save me!

149
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,559
This is the border of Demon Citadel.

150
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,519
I’m afraid the malignant aura will
be stronger up front Yuan Lang,

151
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,260
are you still not willing
to hand over the spirit keys?

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,744
You should enter the place with me then.

153
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,759
I don’t dare to do so.

154
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,820
The rest of us will wait here.

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,140
Here are the spirit keys.

156
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,919
I’ll take care of Ting Nu
and Liu Yi Huan on your behalf.

157
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,559
We’ll celebrate together
after you save Wu Zhi Qi.

158
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,980
Are you threatening me?

159
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,119
I don’t dare to do so.

160
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,820
I just didn’t want you to be worried.

161
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,700
Ting Nu’s medicine is protecting me
from the malignant aura.

162
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,215
As the shadowy overlord,
it descends in terror.

163
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,079
The heavenly calamity,
here lies the Asuras.

164
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,060
Senior is right indeed.

165
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,740
You still came in the end.

166
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,749
God of War, aren’t you getting married
with your senior soon?

167
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,100
You still have time
to interfere with our matters?

168
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,234
I’m here to kill you.

169
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:27,496
We’ll see about that.

170
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,799
I won’t remove the barrier
before the entrance closes.

171
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,550
Yu Si Feng, show me what you got.

172
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,780
You’re so clingy.

173
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,060
God of War, are you missing me as you’ve
not mastered the Sentimental Tactics

174
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,060
with your senior?

175
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,919
You still can’t get over me?

176
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,220
Shut up!

177
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,501
Yu Si Feng!

178
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,399
Demon Lord, welcome back.

179
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,940
Demon Lord, welcome back.

180
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,181
Yu Si Feng!

181
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,129
Where are you?

182
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,210
Come out!

183
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,753
Yu Si Feng!

184
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,300
You better know what’s good for you.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,599
I’m trying to save you.

186
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,799
The vengeful spirits of the Asuras
follow the sounds they hear.

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,839
You’ll only wake them up
if you keep shouting.

188
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,820
Even the God of War
can’t do anything against them.

189
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,683
Yu Si Feng, what are you up to now?

190
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,333
It’s up to you whether to
believe it or not.

191
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,594
You can keep shouting

192
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,079
if you wish to die.

193
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,424
Show me what you got.

194
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,737
What if I don’t?

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,300
I’ll force you to show me then.

196
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,419
Don’t think that you’ll be safe
just because you saved me.

197
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,560
I won’t let you off.

198
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,618
Look at your foot.

199
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:57,578
This painting

200
00:15:58,228 --> 00:16:00,328
depicts the Demon-Immortal War
1,000 years ago.

201
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,220
Star of Mosha, Rahu and Ketu
are the strongest Asuras.

202
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,180
And God of War is
the strongest immortal in the heavens.

203
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,217
But why isn’t there a painting

204
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,460
about the fight between the Star of Mosha
and the God of War?

205
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,020
The reflection of the God of War

206
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,946
is actually an Asura?

207
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,580
The God of War and the Star of Mosha
is the same person indeed.

208
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,430
If Yuan Lang unlocks the Jade Cup,

209
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,719
Xuan Ji will transform
into the Star of Mosha.

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,148
And it’ll be too late by then.

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,030
I mustn’t let Xuan Ji see them.

212
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,860
You even destroyed the God of War
in the painting.

213
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,297
Seems like it has really come to this.

214
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,351
Yuan Lang said the locks
for the Dimension Chain

215
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,412
are located beside the Pool of Bones.

216
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,380
Where exactly are they?

217
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,599
God of War, are you really going
to point at me with your sword?

218
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,980
Senior Hao Chen was right.

219
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,039
You’re devious and cunning.

220
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,318
Who knows? Maybe everything
here is a part of your ploy.

221
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,039
You really believe in your senior, right?

222
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,839
Fine. I saved you
because it was part of my ploy.

223
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,180
You want to kill me? Do it now.

224
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,140
You want to die here? No way.

225
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,280
I’ll bring you back to Mount Shaoyang

226
00:17:58,281 --> 00:17:59,866
so that you can give us an explanation!

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,728
Fine.

228
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:05,676
But now, we have no way to return.

229
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,337
We can only proceed.

230
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,254
God of War,

231
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,204
may I move now?

232
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,900
You better move slowly.

233
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,940
Don’t try anything funny.

234
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,500
This malignant aura around here
is strong indeed.

235
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,162
You wouldn’t need to suffer like this

236
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,543
if you didn’t come in the first place.

237
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,140
You deserved everything.

238
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,417
You’re right.

239
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,982
This is

240
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,580
all my fault.

241
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,720
I told you I would get to the
bottom of your mother’s murder.

242
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,759
This is the list of rewards

243
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,700
that our clan had received after
the Demon-Immortal War.

244
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,879
The malignant aura within Demon Citadel
belongs to the Asuras.

245
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,460
As stated within the list,

246
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,568
Yuan Lang was the only Rose Gold Bird

247
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:28,909
who had received the malignant aura
from King Asura.

248
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,897
So, Yuan Lang is

249
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,066
your mother’s murderer.

250
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,639
It’s useless for you

251
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,300
to show me this piece of evidence
at this current moment.

252
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,599
You promised to bring Yuan Lang to me.

253
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,494
But now, he’s still enjoying himself
in Lize Palace. And you?

254
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,140
You colluded with him
and tried to save Wu Zhi Qi.

255
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,919
You even hide your identity from me.

256
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,620
This list is meaningless to me!

257
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,220
Xuan Ji, the one I want to save

258
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,340
wasn’t Wu Zhi Qi.

259
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,959
Forget it.

260
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,211
One day,

261
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,860
you’ll understand my pain.

262
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,799
Your pain? We’re enemies now.

263
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,741
What more are you hiding from me?

264
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:29,522
Tell me!

265
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:43,100
The gate of Fenru City will only
open when the full moon rises.

266
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,380
Wu Zhi Qi can only escape
if you go in and free him by then.

267
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,548
In the future.

268
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,020
I will tell you if I have the chance.

269
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,411
Now, the full moon has appeared.

270
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,020
The last time we saw a full moon together

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,300
- was in Qingmu Town...
- Stop saying useless things.

272
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,660
If you have nothing else to say,

273
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,473
return with me right away.

274
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,782
Si Feng!

275
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,079
My injuries were too grave.

276
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,420
The malignant aura is
seeping through my injuries.

277
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,524
I need to recuperate.

278
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,020
Look over there.

279
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,300
That lotus actually bloomed
in a desolate place like this.

280
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,864
I’m sure it could

281
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,300
cleanse my body from the malignant aura.

282
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,719
Maybe

283
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,860
it could heal my injuries.

284
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,820
Can you pick it for me?

285
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,220
I’ve helped you just now.

286
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,820
Don’t tell me you want me

287
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,260
to pick that when I’m in this state?

288
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:09,749
You’re in no condition to play tricks.

289
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,835
You better stay here.

290
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,216
Don’t try to escape.

291
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,959
Xuan Ji.

292
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,060
I’m sorry.

293
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,900
Senior was right.

294
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,100
You did change.

295
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,980
- Behind you.
- I won’t fall for your tricks again!

296
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,877
I’m not tricking you.

297
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,094
Be careful!

298
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,479
Hand over the spirit keys.

299
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,620
- Xuan Ji.
- Hand over the spirit keys!

300
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,011
Purple Fox! Save Wu Zhi Qi!

301
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
You!

302
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,159
These four damned chains!

303
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,140
One day, I’ll stuff them inside
the mouth of you immortals!

304
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,373
Did you hear me?

305
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:40,834
I’m going to stuff them inside your mouth!

306
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,519
They broke?

307
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,020
They actually broke!

308
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,849
It’s been over 1,000 years!

309
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,074
My powers have finally restored!

310
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,601
Which one of you saved me?

311
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:09,542
I will express my gratitude!

312
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,460
Little Fox? It’s you?

313
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,460
Wu Zhi Qi.

314
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,140
I... I did it.

315
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,462
It’s me.

316
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,860
I saved you!

317
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,189
Little Fox, are you okay?

318
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,159
I’m fine.

319
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,582
I’m doing well.

320
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,359
Wu Zhi Qi,

321
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,679
you...

322
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,159
Are you okay?

323
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,599
I’m fine!

324
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,479
Little Fox, I’m doing very well now.

325
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,963
I’ve broken free of those chains.

326
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:54,624
I’m brimming with energy now.

327
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,927
Little Fox, you did
all this to save me.

328
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,032
It must’ve been tough.

329
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,238
How about this? When we get out later,

330
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,580
I’ll pluck some grapes for you, okay?

331
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,846
Stupid Monkey,

332
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,580
who cares about your grapes?

333
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,082
I want you

334
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,549
to never abandon me again.

335
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,143
Little Fox, this is not
the time for talks like this.

336
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,390
We’ll talk about it after we leave.

337
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,820
By the way, where did you come from?

338
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,039
I...

339
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,274
Demon Citadel.

340
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,599
Wu Zhi Qi.

341
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,853
Si Feng.

342
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,759
It’s Si Feng.

343
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,839
He and I unlock the chain together.

344
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,839
- You need to help him.
- Okay.

345
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,066
I’ll help him.

346
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,660
It’s good to see you.

347
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,359
Little Fox!

348
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,748
Little Fox!

349
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,180
You’re as useless as you were before.

350
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,660
Si Feng?

351
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,206
I’ll meet you right now!

352
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,639
- Look.
- What’s going on?

353
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,940
- Look.
- That’s strange.

354
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,119
What’s going on?

355
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,828
The Dimension Chain was broken.

356
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,169
And it alerted our land.

357
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:42,886
They’ve saved Wu Zhi Qi.

358
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,813
Xuan Ji, Wu Zhi
Qi has been saved.

359
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:51,152
So, will you go soft on him?

360
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,340
Wu Zhi Qi is saved?

361
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,620
Wu Zhi Qi is saved!

362
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,180
Now, the demon clan will
dominate the three realms!

363
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,820
We’ll dominate the three realms!

364
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,699
Yu Si Feng, do you think I can’t kill you?

365
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,559
You can kill me, but I need to tell
you something before you kill me.

366
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,220
I’m not the Star of Mosha.

367
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,681
I have bitter reasons for everything I do.

368
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,955
When will you stop lying to me?

369
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,157
I’m not lying!

370
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,340
You want to know my bitter reasons?

371
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,439
It’s the fact that

372
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
I would risk myself and do anything
in order to protect the person I love.

373
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,079
I just wanted her to live in peace.

374
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,999
It’s fine even if I have to
pretend to be Star of Mosha.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,893
It’s fine even if
the world misunderstood me.

376
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:44,528
I just hope that one day,

377
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,220
we will be together again.

378
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,879
Xuan Ji,

379
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,209
please give me some time.

380
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,994
I will surely explain everything to you.

381
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,297
I don’t believe

382
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,660
a single word.

383
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:09,959
I hate myself for thinking that

384
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,220
my Si Feng might be able to turn over a
new leaf and return to his original self.

385
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,894
That would’ve been great.

386
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,100
But now, I only realized that

387
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,919
my Si Feng had changed.

388
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,580
He will never return.

389
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:11,639
Si Feng, hang in there.

390
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,260
You’ll be fine after a while.

391
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:19,199
Si Feng, it’s hard for you
to get rid of your anguish.

392
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,036
Hang in there. We’ll be able to return
to the past when your anguish disappears!

393
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,514
Si Feng!

394
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,359
Si Feng!

395
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,679
Si Feng!

396
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,960
Xuan Ji!

397
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,973
No!

398
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,777
Si Feng!

399
00:30:55,477 --> 00:30:57,224
Si Feng! What’s wrong?

400
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:58,402
Si Feng!

401
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,171
Si Feng!

402
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:20,799
Si Feng! Why is this happening?

403
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,940
Why?

404
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,963
Si Feng!

405
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,580
Si Feng!

406
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,639
Si Feng!

407
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,900
Si Feng!

408
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,612
Si Feng! No!

409
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,673
Si Feng!

410
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:01,839
Si Feng!

411
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,540
Si Feng!

412
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,534
Si Feng!

413
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:10,977
- Si Feng!
- Little Beauty!

414
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,008
Little Beauty, do you have
a deep feud with this guy?

415
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,580
Why are you torturing him
with the Vermilion Bird Bottle?

416
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,959
Vermilion Bird Bottle?

417
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,519
Isn’t this the Cleansing Bottle?

418
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,439
Senior said this Cleansing Bottle
can get rid of one’s anguish.

419
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,679
Get rid of one’s anguish?

420
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,599
Listen, the Vermilion Bird Bottle
contains the most anguish in the world.

421
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,399
It would even turn immortals into water.

422
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,660
Your senior lied to you.

423
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,539
If you couldn’t bear to kill him,

424
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:44,479
you should use the Cleansing
Bottle and get rid of Si Feng’s anguish.

425
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,660
It may help him to find his conscience.

426
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,361
This can’t be.

427
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,504
This can’t be!

428
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,879
Si Feng!

429
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,359
Si Feng is my benefactor.

430
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,674
I can’t just let him die!

431
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,937
Yuntian Loop! Chehai Hook!

432
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,767
Break!

433
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,719
Si Feng!

434
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,900
Si Feng!

435
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:28,216
Little Beauty, you
almost killed him just now.

436
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:30,082
But now, you’re concerned about him?

437
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,678
It’s lucky that I saved him in time.

438
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,499
If not, he would’ve been covered with pus.

439
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,399
Never mind. I won’t hold it
against you since we’re old friends.

440
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,959
But he needs to leave with me.

441
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,239
Si Feng! Wake up!

442
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,540
Si Feng!

443
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,713
The Demon Citadel is
a detestable place indeed.

444
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,717
Little Beauty, see you next time.

445
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,519
Si Feng!

446
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,743
Si Feng!

447
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,940
Si Feng!

448
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,622
Si Feng!

449
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,900
The Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook
are amazing indeed.

450
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,370
It ripped apart the very fabric of space.

451
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:29,430
It even connected the Demon Citadel
with Mount Buzhou!

452
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,380
I thought it was someone else.
Yuan Lang, it’s you?

453
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,480
You’re still alive?

454
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,661
My brother.

455
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,551
I’ve tried my best to rescue you
over the past 1,000 years.

456
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:51,332
I’ve finally succeeded today.

457
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,229
But Little Fox told me that

458
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,140
this Si Feng was the one
who had rescued me?

459
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:59,241
What? Were you involved as well?

460
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,100
I put in much effort
in obtaining the four spirit keys.

461
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,150
As for Yu Si Feng,

462
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:10,692
he did give me some minor assistance.

463
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,188
So, going to the Demon Citadel
is only considered as a minor assistance?

464
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:16,359
My brother, since you’ve
put it so much effort,

465
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,860
why didn’t you come and
save me personally in the end?

466
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,807
Do you miss me?

467
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,868
Or do you miss my
Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook?

468
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,439
My brother, you’re so humorous.

469
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,542
I just think that your divine weapons
are truly amazing.

470
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:39,043
Can you show them to me?

471
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,888
My brother, are you kidding me?

472
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,463
There’s nothing for you to see.

473
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:46,140
What if you lose them by accident?

474
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,429
Return!

475
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,813
By the way,

476
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:56,456
Si Feng has sustained some
serious injuries because of me.

477
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,235
Where are you staying?
I’ll treat his injuries there.

478
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:00,047
Lize Palace over the West Sea.

479
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,919
But this is not urgent, right?

480
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,338
Of course it’s not urgent to you
when you’re not the one dying.

481
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,679
I’ll go to Lize Palace for now.
See you there.

482
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,287
This Wu Zhi Qi
doesn’t appreciate us at all.

483
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:17,908
He’s the Left Lieutenant.

484
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,077
He’s more powerful than me.
It’s normal for him to be arrogant.

485
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,471
Relay my orders.

486
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:30,420
Set up a feast and
welcome Wu Zhi Qi.

487
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,604
Yes.

488
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,327
- Who’s there?
- Who’s there?

489
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,851
Two hours had passed since then.

490
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:33,010
Why isn’t Wu Zhi Qi here yet?

491
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:35,859
We set up a feast just for him. The food
will be cold if we wait any longer.

492
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:37,905
Elder Feng, that’s enough.

493
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:39,962
Let’s take a look outside.

494
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,479
Don’t trouble yourself.

495
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,624
I’m here.

496
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,154
My brother, you’ve made us wait.

497
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,655
Come, have a seat.

498
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,140
I didn’t expect the demons
to be so disrespectful

499
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:17,154
and cold-blooded
after my absence.

500
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:18,655
What do you mean by that?

501
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,948
The palace lord is the reincarnation
of Star of Mosha.

502
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,319
He’s my benefactor as well.

503
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,759
Now, his life is in danger,
yet you are throwing a feast?

504
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,418
What do you mean by this?

505
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,140
Listen, if Yu Si Feng
doesn’t survive today,

506
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,426
if you dare to drink or
eat, I will make you pay!

507
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,380
We did this out of good intention.

508
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:52,155
Why are you so angry?

509
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,751
Yuan Lang, save your breath.

510
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:56,012
- Go and save him right now.
- Save him?

511
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,300
I’m not a medical expert.
How could I save him?

512
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:03,060
It’s fine. I know someone
who’s a medical expert.

513
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,003
Ting Nu!

514
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,218
Ting Nu, tell him the things
that you’ve told me just now.

515
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,508
Si Feng was struck with
the malignant aura of Demon Citadel

516
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:41,118
and the blood fog of
the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

517
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,874
Either one of them
is hard enough to treat on its own.

518
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,775
Now, there’s only one way to save him.

519
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,711
We need two demons
which are more powerful than him.

520
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,819
They must have equal levels of power
and use their powers together

521
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,151
in order to force out
the malignant aura in his body.

522
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,359
You hear him?

523
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,519
Powerful demons, equal levels of power.

524
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,794
What a coincidence.
You and I are the right candidates.

525
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,907
Let’s go.

526
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:24,040
Yuan Lang, what
do you mean by this?

527
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,576
Are you not willing to save
the Star of Mosha?

528
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:30,732
If Yu Si Feng was the reincarnation
of Star of Mosha, I’d save him.

529
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:34,013
But he was seriously injured by the
malignant aura and Vermilion Bird Bottle.

530
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:35,834
I suspect that

531
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,321
he’s not the real Star of Mosha.

532
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,558
Let me ask you this then.

533
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,319
Who else can endure
the power of the Vermilion Bird Bottle

534
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,671
and the malignant aura
besides Star of Mosha?

535
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,026
Moreover, his soul hasn’t returned
to his body yet.

536
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:52,799
He has less than half of his powers.

537
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,825
Your logic doesn’t work at all.

538
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,439
Don’t tell me you’re plotting something?
Just like what you did 1,000 years ago?

539
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,580
Are you trying to betray the demon clan?

540
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:15,519
What do you mean by that?

541
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,294
I mean nothing.

542
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,687
I just heard some rumors about you.

543
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,284
Don’t be so nervous.

544
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:23,702
1,000 years ago, our Right Lieutenant

545
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:27,583
wanted to become a spy in the heavens
for the sake of our clan.

546
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:30,359
I think he won’t betray our clan.

547
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,558
According to my understanding,
he’s most concerned about our clan,

548
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,938
am I right, old friend?

549
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:40,625
You’re right.

550
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:47,231
Brother, since you had
said that, I’ll listen to you.

551
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,631
That’s great.

552
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,670
Where is it?

553
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,801
I’ve been here for so long,

554
00:43:42,802 --> 00:43:45,222
but I haven’t seen someone
who had suffered this much.

555
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,940
Stinky woman, you have a pitiful life.

556
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,366
Flying Snake,
I’ve forgiven you many times.

557
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,907
I didn’t expect you to be so impudent!

558
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,159
How dare you sneak into
King Bailing’s chamber!

559
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,459
Wait, Green Dragon. Listen to me.

560
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,279
- I’m not...
- Shut up! Still trying to deny it?

561
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,479
Listen, you’ve broken the rules
of the heavens.

562
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,700
This time, you’ll be put behind bars.

563
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:27,979
It’s good that you’re awake.

564
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,320
Seems like your condition is stable.

565
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,292
Sorry to

566
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,702
trouble you again.

567
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:41,363
I only played a minor role.

568
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:46,140
You were saved because of
Wu Zhi Qi’s and Yuan Lang’s power.

569
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,399
Yuan Lang didn’t want to save you at all.

570
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,400
You would’ve been dead if Wu
Zhi Qi didn’t force him to do so.

571
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:57,239
It’s good that you’re safe.

572
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,088
I’ll make some tonic
to help you recover your strength.

573
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,399
Look at your lifeless face.

574
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,100
You narrowly escaped death once again.

575
00:45:15,273 --> 00:45:18,629
Chu Xuan Ji is vicious indeed.

576
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,092
Maybe

577
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,042
it’s because I’ve hidden
too many secrets from her.

578
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,548
That’s why Chu Xuan Ji

579
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,029
did that.

580
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:40,252
One day, when she finds out the truth,

581
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,540
she’ll appreciate my effort.

582
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,629
She used
the Vermilion Bird Bottle, you know?

583
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,355
Even if she doesn’t know the truth,

584
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,247
it’s obvious that she wants to kill you

585
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,084
when she uses something like that!

586
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,711
Yu Si Feng, Chu Xuan
Ji is trying to kill you!

587
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,295
She wouldn’t resort to that if
she still has feelings for you.

588
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,947
That girl is too vicious.

589
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:09,262
I would never teach you how to court her

590
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:11,563
if I knew this was going to happen
in the first place.

591
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,298
Now that Wu Zhi Qi has been saved,

592
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,982
my plan will succeed soon.

593
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:24,209
And everything will be clear by then.

594
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,760
I saw Xuan Ji’s background
in Demon Citadel.

595
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,244
She’s the God of War

596
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:33,460
and the Star of Mosha.
