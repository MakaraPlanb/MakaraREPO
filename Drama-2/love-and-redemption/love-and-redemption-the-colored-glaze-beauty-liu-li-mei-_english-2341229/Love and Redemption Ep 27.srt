00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,270
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,279
<i>EPISODE 27</i>

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,839
I remember everything.

4
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,188
No.

5
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,740
Xuan Ji, don’t go!

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,516
Did you kill

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,547
all of them?

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,667
Yes.

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,100
Not only do I need to kill them,

10
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,942
I need to burn down this place as well.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,279
The Qiao Family

12
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:14,087
has done many despicable deeds

13
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,299
under the backing of their uncle
in the court.

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,286
My father was honest and upright.

15
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,321
He reported their misdeeds,

16
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,136
yet they framed him as a traitor.

17
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,565
My father, my brother,

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,660
every man in my family

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,020
were beheaded.

20
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,314
All the women became slaves.

21
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:42,832
It’s all thanks to the Qiao Family.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,983
So,

23
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,850
you’ve been waiting for this chance
all along.

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,540
You planned all this out
ever since you knew Mister Qiao.

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,999
It’s all part of your plan
for him to redeem you

26
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,659
and bring you back to his family.

27
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,354
You did everything

28
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,548
for vengeance.

29
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:11,948
When I was marked with the
slave mark and sold to the brothel,

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,878
I swore that

31
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:17,702
I would take my revenge.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,501
What? You want to
call the authorities here?

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,839
I’ve achieved my wish.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,281
Death means nothing to me.

35
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,022
Why should I report this?

36
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,773
The magistrate court is
only a street away.

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,947
They’ll send their people here

38
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,199
after a few minutes.

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,473
Hurry and leave.

40
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:45,268
I have some money and land deeds.

41
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,385
I saved all of these for you.

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,759
Take them.

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,399
You haven’t found
your missing family, right?

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,601
Hurry and leave!

45
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,942
How did you know that?

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,180
You spilled the beans when you were drunk.

47
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:02,066
And you forgot about it.

48
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,509
No one will be able to find you
after you leave.

49
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,386
After that, you can do
the things you wanted to.

50
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,119
And find the people you wish to see.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,519
What about you?

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,206
Are you going to shield this for me?

53
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,628
Don’t worry about me.

54
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,915
They won’t pursue you
after they capture me.

55
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,386
That way, you’ll have time to escape.

56
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,724
Why?

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,620
You said you didn’t believe in people.

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,559
I just wanted you to believe in me.

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,919
This time, I’ll take a bet.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,253
Whether you will

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,780
remember in your heart or not.

62
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,902
How do you determine the result?

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,332
Will you ask me
after your death?

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,733
Don’t be silly.

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,079
Who knows?

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,802
Leave now!

67
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:17,383
Just leave!

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,483
I’m here!

69
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,042
<i>EXECUTION GROUND</i>

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,180
What a silly guy.

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,660
No one will remember you.

72
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,090
This is just the past.

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,487
Stop thinking about it.

74
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,948
Finding Xuan Ji is my priority.

75
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,197
Don’t tell me...

76
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:49,438
The tribulations of Xuan Ji and I,

77
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,133
all of them seemed familiar.

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,380
King Xin, what are you trying to do?

79
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:07,399
Your Majesty, you’re a corrupted ruler.

80
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,759
The people are suffering under your rule.

81
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,997
I want to put things right.

82
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,331
How dare you!

83
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,687
Father.

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,919
You are...

85
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,300
I’m the daughter

86
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:27,114
of the concubine you banished

87
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,333
to the Cold Palace.

88
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,429
You didn’t expect this, right?

89
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,359
I told you before.

90
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,020
I will make sure
you get everything you want.

91
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,060
His Majesty has passed away!

92
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,681
His only heir is Princess Jing Yuan.

93
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:07,422
Now, Princess Jing Yuan
will take over his throne

94
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,485
and become the new emperor!

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,392
Long live Your Majesty!

96
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:17,293
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

97
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,779
Your Majesty,

98
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:33,995
our country is stable now.

99
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,061
Why are you still so ruthless?

100
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:39,182
Too many blood has been shed

101
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,463
since your ascension.

102
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,941
King Xin, you utilized our army
for your personal gains.

103
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,759
And you colluded with my officers.

104
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,980
And you’ve always rejected my orders,
looking down on my power.

105
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,331
King Xin, do I need to list
down your crimes for you?

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,829
I thought

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,260
the things I’ve done for you
are enough for you to trust me.

108
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,100
But in the end,
you still wanted to kill me.

109
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,220
One’s intention is the hardest thing
to predict in the world.

110
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,195
King Xin, everyone in the court
responds to you.

111
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,740
How could I be safe with you around?

112
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,508
I won the war for you.

113
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,799
I helped you to ascend the throne.

114
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,235
And I protected the country with my heart.

115
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,980
But in the end, I still lost
just because you say

116
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,629
one’s intention is unpredictable.

117
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,372
King Xin, you have two options.

118
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:54,759
If you die alone, I won’t
arrest the other officers.

119
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,279
If you defy my orders, I’ll
make sure everyone gets a taste.

120
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,586
King Xin.

121
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,500
What do you think?

122
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,025
Fine.

123
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,060
Your Majesty, I hope you can
believe in people next time.

124
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,066
So that

125
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,028
you won’t be lonely

126
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:20,244
on your throne.

127
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,180
Such impudence!

128
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,429
I told you before.

129
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,690
I’ll make sure

130
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,660
you get everything you want.

131
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,338
Impossible.

132
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,959
Why does it have to end like this
every time?

133
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,269
Don’t tell me...

134
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,380
Don’t tell me this is our fate?

135
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,757
I don’t believe it.

136
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,420
With all my encounters with you,

137
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,920
I’m sure it won’t
end like this every time.

138
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,883
Are you going to transfer your eyes
to me using the forbidden spell?

139
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:45,598
You’re the Queen of Witches.

140
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,079
If you can’t master
witchcraft and inherit the title,

141
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,804
you’ll be burned alive.

142
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,305
I don’t want you to die.

143
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:57,460
Even if that’s the case,
I still won’t remember you.

144
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,279
I know.

145
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,089
Just stay alive.

146
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,738
Tell them that

147
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,460
you prayed in the mountains

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,380
and you got your vision back
because the heavens took pity on you.

149
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,140
If my tribe knows that
we used the forbidden spell,

150
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,890
I will face death.

151
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:20,087
I will travel to a place far away.

152
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,580
No one will discover this secret.

153
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,168
In this life,

154
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,861
we will never meet again.

155
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,529
We will never meet again?

156
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,907
Fine.

157
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,246
Leave now.

158
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,260
Only one of us

159
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,348
will survive tonight.

160
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,759
Demon slayer, are you crazy?

161
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,580
You’ll die if you expand all your energy!

162
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,239
What has my fate got to do with you?

163
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,623
I’m happy even if
the lightning is to strike me!

164
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,564
Why do you keep pursuing me?

165
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:35,159
I want to use my powers
to get rid of your anguish.

166
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,359
So that you won’t be trapped
by your anguish after death.

167
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,869
So that you’ll be safe.

168
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,815
You sacrificed your life
just to get rid of my anguish.

169
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,622
I don’t know what you’re trying to do.

170
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:25,309
I’m not a good person.

171
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,177
I’m involved in your tribulations.

172
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,179
This is the only way to end it.

173
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,731
It’s fine even if you don’t understand.

174
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:34,438
But please don’t forget me.

175
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,119
This is your tribulation.

176
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,839
What has it got to do with me?

177
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,339
Why should I remember you?

178
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,096
It’s fine even if you forget me.

179
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,380
I’ll wait for you.

180
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,087
No matter where you are, I will

181
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,100
always find you.

182
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,834
This is your tribulation.

183
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,806
Why are you forcing yourself to do this?

184
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,239
I told you before.

185
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,500
I’ll let you go if you tell me
the location of the Treasure Cove.

186
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,931
I don’t know

187
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,634
any Treasure Cove.

188
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,820
We’ve known each other for so long.

189
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,608
Don’t you

190
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,340
believe in me?

191
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,728
We’ve known each other for many years.

192
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:56,429
I’m sure you understand me well enough.

193
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,120
I don’t want the useless stuff
you’ve drawn.

194
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,780
Listen,

195
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:07,988
even if you spend your entire life
drawing my portraits,

196
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:10,484
I will never fancy you.

197
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,660
Senior, you only used
half of your strength.

198
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:23,852
Are you looking down on me?

199
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,178
You lost.

200
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,870
Is the fight

201
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,687
the only thing on your mind?

202
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,537
Yes.

203
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:36,798
I will become the sect leader.

204
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,726
But I’ve never wanted

205
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:42,022
to steal that position from you.

206
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,780
In the end,

207
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,269
it was my own wishful thinking.

208
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,255
Why?

209
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,940
Why does it end like this every time?

210
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,721
Don’t tell me

211
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,300
this tragic end is our fate?

212
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,020
I don’t believe it.
I’m sure we’ll be together

213
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,940
eventually.

214
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,239
Si Feng!

215
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,700
Xuan Ji! Purple Fox!

216
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,199
This is bad!

217
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,060
Their primordial spirits were absorbed
and they’re facing their inner demons.

218
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,999
I’m sorry.

219
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,660
I can only distract you for now

220
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,555
so that Xuan Ji can finish
her transformation.

221
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,536
After that, we can leave.

222
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,860
No! We can’t destroy the barrier!

223
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,096
You!

224
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,315
Min Yan!

225
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:53,743
Blood is its weakness.

226
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:55,207
Let’s cast our spells together!

227
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,639
It worked! Let’s go!

228
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,079
Let’s go!

229
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,299
Let’s go!

230
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,860
I see you as my best friend.

231
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,725
Why are you trying to kill me?

232
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,506
Someone hired me to assassinate you.

233
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:39,159
You’re my last mission.

234
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,700
I’ll be free after your death.

235
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,879
What if you fail your mission?

236
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,260
I’ll die of poison.

237
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,152
Why?

238
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,433
I hope that

239
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,740
you’ll never forget me

240
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,665
after

241
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,340
my death.

242
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,740
Just give up.

243
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,863
Why should I remember you?

244
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,820
It’s fine even if you forget me.

245
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,484
I will wait for you.

246
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,900
And I will find you eventually.

247
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:07,568
We’ll settle our debts

248
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,812
by then.

249
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,820
All our previous nine encounters
had ended in this way.

250
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,980
It’s only my wishful thinking.

251
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,180
If our tenth encounter

252
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:36,503
ends in this way as well,

253
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,223
what’s the point of our encounters then?

254
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,363
Wake up!

255
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,940
When will you stop lying to me?

256
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:09,467
What sins have I commit?

257
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,488
You have no right to judge me!

258
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,796
I was a joke

259
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,401
in the heavens all along!

260
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:18,422
And you want me to
become an immortal again?

261
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,020
What a joke!

262
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:23,122
I would rather

263
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,759
become a demon!

264
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,260
Become a demon!

265
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,300
I’ll wipe out this unfair realm!

266
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,660
This is bad! Her powers are awakening!

267
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,506
God of War summoned her armor?

268
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,033
I’ll definitely find you

269
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,750
if I follow your armor.

270
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,119
Si Feng!

271
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,411
- Xuan Ji!
- Si Feng!

272
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,691
Si Feng!

273
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,992
What’s wrong with Xuan Ji?

274
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:29,293
Si Feng!

275
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:33,999
It’s true!

276
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,679
- Xuan Ji is...
- What?

277
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,406
Why is this happening to her?

278
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,959
Tell us! What’s wrong with Xuan Ji?

279
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,174
Xuan Ji, she’s the
reincarnation of the God of War!

280
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,605
God of War?

281
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:50,104
She’s the God of War who wiped out
the Asuras 1,000 years ago.

282
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:54,399
And now, her
powers are awakening.

283
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,319
So, the general in her
dreams, it’s not a dream at all.

284
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,734
It’s her all along.

285
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,620
I’m done for! I can’t hold on!

286
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,860
Si Feng!

287
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,098
Heavenly Lightning?

288
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,759
So, it’s in that direction.

289
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,599
The God of War’s anguish
is devouring their vitality.

290
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,119
Hurry and save them!

291
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,719
How do we save them?

292
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,399
Chu Xuan Ji, I’ll kill you
if you dare to hurt Si Feng!

293
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,818
Use the Spell of Tranquility!

294
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,168
My king, I’m afraid that
I couldn’t follow your orders.

295
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,636
It seems like
I will be sacrificed as well!

296
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:01,682
I’ll fight until the end!

297
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,260
What is that?

298
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,479
That’s the power of the heavens!

299
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,420
Someone is trying to stop
the God of War’s awakening!

300
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,557
Si Feng!

301
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,599
Who dares to hinder me?

302
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,860
Those who hinder me

303
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,144
will die!

304
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,559
Xuan Ji!

305
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,900
Stop!

306
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,145
If this continues, Si Feng will die!

307
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,786
Everyone else will die as well!

308
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,879
But if I shatter the mirror
and stop her awakening,

309
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,380
I won’t be able to save Yu’Er!

310
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,103
Si Feng!

311
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,080
Si Feng!

312
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,118
I can’t hold on for much longer!

313
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:22,523
I’ll fight until the end!

314
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,432
The Heavenly Lightning has dissipated.

315
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,665
It’s nearby.

316
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,119
I’m sure I can find Xuan Ji around here.

317
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,860
God of War.

318
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,260
I’ll have a good fight with you.

319
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,826
Which scoundrel is...

320
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,818
What is this?

321
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,639
You stink!

322
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,580
You stole my Star Compass.
Where are you trying to go?

323
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,759
Green Dragon, you shouldn’t malign me.

324
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,679
I lost Dingkun Sword last time
because of your interruption!

325
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,319
And now, I’ve lost the armor as well.

326
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,750
The God of War will awaken soon.
It’s a huge matter.

327
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,860
You can’t afford to
bear responsibility for this!

328
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,024
Armor?

329
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,638
- Isn’t it right here?
- Are you blind?

330
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,971
You better...

331
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,276
It wasn’t there just now.

332
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,359
I don’t care. It’s such a big matter.

333
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,678
I need to go and check it out.

334
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,082
You can’t go.

335
00:34:30,874 --> 00:34:32,238
Why?

336
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,340
The God of War will awaken soon.
Who are you to stop me?

337
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,479
I’m stopping you under
King Bailing’s order.

338
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,279
He ordered me to keep an eye on you.

339
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,638
And to stop you from
involving yourself with the God of War.

340
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,220
You better follow me back.

341
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,008
I don’t believe you.
And you’ll never control me.

342
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,019
Si Feng!

343
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,781
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

344
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:07,399
Si Feng!

345
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,773
Si Feng!

346
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,919
- Si Feng, please wake up!
- Xuan Ji!

347
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,319
Xuan Ji!

348
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,919
Xuan Ji!

349
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,919
Ting Nu, what’s going on?

350
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,279
When will they wake up?

351
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,818
Their primordial spirits
have returned to their bodies.

352
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,406
They are in a shock
due to the impact of the explosion.

353
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,534
They’ll be fine after some rest.

354
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,060
Her awakening isn’t complete.

355
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:35,765
What will happen to Yu’Er?

356
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,439
What’s Liu Yi Huan doing?

357
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,599
He actually used his celestial eye
to interrupt her awakening?

358
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,874
My Lord.

359
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,439
Since we know the identity
of the God of War now,

360
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,559
why don’t you let me capture
Chu Xuan Ji right now?

361
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,642
When she awakens her power,
you may absorb her powers

362
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:56,959
by using the Soul Furnace.

363
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,958
And everything will go
according to your plan.

364
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,478
Isn’t that for the best?

365
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,705
Chu Xuan Ji is very stubborn.

366
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,158
If we capture her by force,
she may respond violently

367
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,639
and the God of War may
never complete her awakening.

368
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,860
If so, her powers will reduce drastically.

369
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:15,153
I can’t take this risk.

370
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:20,900
I do have a way to stimulate
her to awake her powers.

371
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,860
Tell Liu Yi Huan that

372
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:26,399
if he wants her daughter to stay alive,

373
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,973
he must follow my orders.

374
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,669
Yes.

375
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,260
Xuan Ji, you’re awake?

376
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,980
I... You...

377
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,423
Xuan Ji.

378
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:19,199
All of you are here?

379
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,665
- This is great.
- Of course we’re here.

380
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,919
Here.

381
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,621
Wipe your face.

382
00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:32,742
What’s wrong?

383
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,239
It’s hot.

384
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,399
It’s hot? Did you recover your six senses?
This is great!

385
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,479
If it’s too hot,
I’ll cool it down for you.

386
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,500
It’s fine. It’s not that hot.

387
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,673
I feel warm and comfortable.

388
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:49,895
Xuan Ji.

389
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,820
What exactly did you see in that mirror?

390
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:03,686
I saw my past.

391
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,100
Were you the God of War in the past?

392
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,879
Xuan Ji is the God of War indeed.

393
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,898
My junior, who was talentless
before, is actually someone that great?

394
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,839
No wonder the Demon Whip was destroyed.

395
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,279
I thought it was the power
of Dingkun Sword.

396
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,089
I didn’t expect it to be Xuan Ji’s power.

397
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,519
There’s more to that!

398
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,119
Gudiao on Mount Lutai,
Aoyin on Mount Haiwan,

399
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,940
and the Samadhi Fire
on Mount Gao as well.

400
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,839
I was worried for nothing.
I thought she was possessed or something.

401
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,100
I wouldn’t need to worry if I knew that
she was the reincarnation of God of War.

402
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,599
Xuan Ji, tell us.

403
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,740
How does it feel to be the God of War?
It must’ve been great, right?

404
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,493
I hate it very much.

405
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:51,833
I hate the God of War.

406
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,419
I hate my past.

407
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,119
I hate the heavens.

408
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,219
I hate everything inside the mirror.

409
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:06,106
I only see blood,
wars, and lies.

410
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:08,279
Everything else was cold.

411
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,939
They cheated you?

412
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,280
Are you referring to the heavens?

413
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,039
I don’t know what happened either.

414
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,380
I just...

415
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:22,700
I just saw that I was chained.

416
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,840
And I was suffering so much.

417
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:30,879
But none of them wanted to listen to me.

418
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,260
All of them wanted me to leave.

419
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,199
The human realm is better.

420
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,919
Here, I have you.

421
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,399
You are there for me.

422
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,180
I feel alive down here.

423
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,279
Xuan Ji, it’s over now.

424
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,879
It’s all in the past.

425
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,479
But I didn’t expect my junior
to be the God of War.

426
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,759
If people know about this,
Shaoyang Sect will be glorious.

427
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,279
We mustn’t tell anyone about this.

428
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,239
Sky Hall is trying to revive
the Star of Mosha.

429
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,159
And the nemesis of Star of Mosha
is the God of War.

430
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,300
We should keep quiet so that
Sky Hall won’t try to target her.

431
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,559
That’s right. I’m so dumb.

432
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,919
We need to keep this a secret.

433
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,719
Xuan Ji, did you see
Si Feng in the mirror?

434
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,779
That’s right. Si Feng said all
his nine tribulations were related to you.

435
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,295
His nine tribulations?

436
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,852
I didn’t see any tribulations.

437
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:27,193
I only saw what happened to me
in the heavens.

438
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,959
The Mirror of Origin reflects the past
that we couldn’t let go of.

439
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,119
Little Phoenix saw you because
he couldn’t let go of you.

440
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,999
You didn’t see him?

441
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,260
That means he’s not inside your heart.

442
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:47,639
I was blind. I even wanted
to help you two to be together.

443
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,599
Now, I think you should
stay far away from him.

444
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,519
No! Brother Liu, that’s not the case!

445
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,079
What exactly happened within the mirror?

446
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,999
How would we know
what’s going on inside the mirror?

447
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,039
We only saw Little Phoenix coughing blood
because he was too depressed.

448
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,599
It’s unlucky if he encounters this once.

449
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,439
Three times? Maybe he’s
trying to atone for his sins.

450
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,418
But he died nine times because of you.

451
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:10,759
I think, you are
just not meant for each other.

452
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,106
I beg you, show him some mercy this time.

453
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,663
Just let him off.

454
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:20,799
Xuan Ji?

455
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,129
Xuan Ji, what’s wrong?

456
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,053
I don’t know what’s going on either.

457
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:26,413
I just...

458
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,572
I feel bad when I hear about
Si Feng’s suffering.

459
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,313
I feel like I couldn’t breathe.

460
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,559
You can’t breathe?

461
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,879
Seems like you do have your six senses
back. You know how to care for people now.

462
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,199
Oh right.

463
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,938
Brother Liu, where’s Si Feng?

464
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:45,359
Where’s Si Feng?

465
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,919
I don’t know.

466
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,816
Maybe he left because he’s too sad.

467
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,550
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

468
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,159
Why did you say those things?

469
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,999
I’m telling the truth.

470
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,399
Don’t you know
Little Phoenix well enough?

471
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,399
He won’t tell anyone
about his suffering and pain.

472
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,980
If I don’t tell her, how
would she care for him?

473
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,941
In this life,

474
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:34,992
we’ll never meet again.

475
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:36,617
Never meet again?

476
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,672
Even if you spend your entire life
drawing my portraits,

477
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,331
I will never fancy you.

478
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,710
Si Feng!

479
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,542
Si Feng!

480
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:52,040
Si Feng!

481
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:56,001
It was my wishful thinking all along.

482
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,490
I’ll be free after your death.

483
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:04,767
Si Feng!

484
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,928
Si Feng!

485
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:12,205
Si Feng!

486
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,515
Si Feng!
