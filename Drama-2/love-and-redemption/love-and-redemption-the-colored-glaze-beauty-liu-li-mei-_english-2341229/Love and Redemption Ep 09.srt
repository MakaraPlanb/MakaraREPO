00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,448
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,582
<i>EPISODE 9</i>

3
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,759
You’re wearing this mask because of me.

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,599
But don’t worry, I’ll find a way to
remove the Loveless Mask for you.

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,559
I told you before. This was my decision.

6
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,159
Brother Liu, you don’t
need to blame yourself.

7
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,399
To become emotionless and focus on
my training is a good thing as well.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,519
How is that a good thing?

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,239
Our training is hard enough by itself.

10
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,198
But now, you have to
force yourself to be emotionless as well.

11
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,561
That’ll make your life meaningless,
you know?

12
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,959
It’s not a good thing.

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,639
It’s fine. Don’t worry.

14
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,888
I’ll definitely find a solution for you.

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,980
By the way,

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,639
come out now.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,948
Come out.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,418
I’ll return you your spirit beast.

19
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,119
Ascending the Heavenly Realm
was tough indeed.

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,890
Silver Snake, you were naughty.

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,730
Thank you, Brother Liu.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,010
Why are you thanking me?

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,799
Okay.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,060
I’ll leave now.

25
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,090
Xuan Ji, are you done with your training?

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,918
Ling Long.

27
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,837
Isn’t this the bell Si Feng gave you?

28
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,207
I’m sure you kept in touch, right?

29
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,532
How is he doing?

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
Senior Hao Chen confiscated

31
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,799
everything I had when I went to
Xuyang Peak.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,039
That’s why I didn’t contact him
for four years.

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,239
You didn’t contact him at all?

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,519
Xuan Ji, before Si Feng left,

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,219
he wanted you to contact him
once you woke up, you know?

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,349
Besides, even if he did
confiscate everything,

37
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,127
you could still write him letters.

38
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,719
Write letters?

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,829
I was busy with my training every day.

40
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,080
I never thought about that.

41
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,216
You’re too heartless.

42
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,507
Did you forget him already?

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,268
And you never contacted me as
well after you went to Xuyang Peak.

44
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,159
I would’ve severed my ties with you
if you weren’t my sister.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,206
Ling Long, how could that be?

46
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,678
I missed you so much.

47
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,239
But I think it’s fine
if I keep you all in my heart.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,919
Besides, sisters and our friends
will stay with us forever, right?

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,799
Initially, I wanted
to finish my training

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,879
as soon as possible so that
I could meet up with you sooner.

51
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,399
Same goes for Si Feng as well.
We made a promise.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,279
We’ll train together once
I leave the mountain.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,679
That’s why I didn’t contact him
for four years.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,399
That doesn’t matter, right?

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,234
But Xuan Ji, you need to
maintain your relationships.

56
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,519
No one will wait at the same spot for you.

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,687
I thought you would’ve
learnt about other things

58
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,128
besides your training.

59
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,907
I didn’t expect you to still be
a blockhead in relationships.

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,177
Ling Long, will Si Feng be angry
because I didn’t contact him?

61
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,759
Will he ignore me?

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,719
About that, I
can’t say for sure.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,008
I’m sure he won’t do that.

64
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,152
Si Feng must be very busy in Lize Palace.

65
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:37,349
He needs to train as well.

66
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,721
I’m sure he forgot about this
due to his busy schedule.

67
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,159
It’s fine. I’ll find him immediately
after we leave Mount Shaoyang.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,305
And the four of us
can roam the world together.

69
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:45,664
I’m sure it would be fun.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,383
Have some fruit wine.

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,714
Great wine.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,650
Xuan Ji, I didn’t ask this before
because it was inconvenient.

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,130
Did you find any shards
when you went to Xuyang Peak?

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,959
It’s fine. Maybe we could find them
when we roam around.

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,690
Sixth Senior, I’ll stop finding them.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,576
Senior Hao Chen told me that
everyone has a different purpose in life.

77
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,266
And I should treat it as such.

78
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,440
I should be protecting
the Mirror of Origin

79
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,759
instead of searching for them
in order to recover my six senses.

80
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,410
What if I become obsessed with it?

81
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,170
Is that so?

82
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,770
Did the strange power appear again
during your training?

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,129
That’s good. We won’t look for it then.

84
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:41,490
Oh right, Sixth Senior, I
have some good stuff for you.

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,284
There’s an immortal tree on Xuyang Peak.

86
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,865
Its fruit is delicious.

87
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:50,053
But it only bears fruit once
every five years.

88
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:54,984
That’s why I’ve saved some
for you, Ling Long, and Si Feng.

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,690
You little glutton.
You actually saved some for us?

90
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,130
Not bad at all. Seems like
my efforts were not in vain.

91
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,173
You’re unlike your sister at all.

92
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,104
I have no idea
what she’s thinking about.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,879
- Min Yan!
- Ling Long...

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,610
Ling Long is going to dance
with a fellow male disciple!

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,450
Sixth Senior, what about this?

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,879
Xuan Ji, your senior doesn’t
like the drink and the fruit.

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,101
I’ll take them for myself.

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,889
I...

99
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:36,239
My lord, after the failure of
Shadow Demon in Shaoyang Sect,

100
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,930
we’ve planted spies in the four sects
successfully.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,039
But, due to Shadow Demon’s failure,

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,039
and to avoid any further
suspicions, I think we should

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,919
stay in the shadows for now.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,479
We should wait for the right time
to grab the spirit keys.

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,079
We still need to wait?

106
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,460
How long do I need to wait?

107
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,250
My lord, we...

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,051
Who’s there?

109
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,029
You didn’t manage to locate

110
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,999
the God of War and the Star of Mosha
these few years,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,799
and you didn’t obtain
the spirit keys as well.

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,599
Wolf, aren’t you too merciful?

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,010
Isn’t that the reason
you got nothing done at all?

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,639
Wu Tong, do you think you have
the right to speak in this place?

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,439
Our lord is keeping you here

116
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,309
because he just wanted you to tell us
more about the Five Great Sects.

117
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,257
Just be a good dog.

118
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,188
When you’re a dog,

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,290
you shouldn’t just come out
and bark like this.

120
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,959
The Sky Hall only appreciates
capable people.

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,519
Those who got nothing done
should just keep quiet.

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,959
Wolf, what do you think?

123
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,810
I just didn’t want to reveal
our true strength too soon.

124
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:46,039
My lord, I just wanted
to avoid casualties

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,559
from dealing with the Five Great Sects.

126
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,017
The demon tribe has been
training in secret for 1,000 years.

127
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,519
Your strength is much greater
than the Five Great Sects.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,964
If they aren’t willing to
cooperate with us,

129
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,199
it’s the best excuse for us
to execute them without mercy.

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,425
Why should we hide?

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,107
You’re just trying to get your revenge
against the humans who had driven you out.

132
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,592
Wu Tong, don’t try to manipulate
us due to your personal hatred.

133
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,163
It’s precisely because of that.

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,919
Only a human knows how to
force another human to submit.

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,561
To manipulate and destroy them.

136
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,581
My lord,

137
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,079
why don’t you give me this chance?

138
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,159
I’ll destroy the Five Great Sects
and obtain the spirit keys.

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,797
My lord, Wu Tong is just a dog
who has been driven out from its shelter.

140
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:34,079
We mustn’t trust him.

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,479
But this pathetic dog managed to find out
that the Xuanyuan Sect is lying to you.

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,969
- What?
- Someone!

143
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,639
You were misled by
Xuanyuan Sect’s spirit stone all along.

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,170
One of the spirit keys was actually
hidden inside the Destiny Pearl.

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,290
You didn’t know about that.

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,069
Tell us.

147
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,359
Yes!

148
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,319
The spirit key is hidden inside
the Destiny Pearl in our sect.

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,429
But only Sect Leader Zhu Shi knows about

150
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,997
the location of the Destiny Pearl.

151
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:24,970
Wolf, you chose the
wrong person to threaten.

152
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,730
Instead of threatening those
who are loyal to the sect,

153
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,359
isn’t it easier for you if you threaten
the weaklings in the sect?

154
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,634
Darn it.

155
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,413
My lord, please give me a chance.

156
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,239
Let me obtain the spirit keys for you.

157
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,697
We’ve been hiding for too long.

158
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:49,570
It’s time to create a scene so
that our prey would be attracted.

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,349
Wu Tong, from today onwards,

160
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,920
you’ll be the leader of
Mount Buzhou’s hideout.

161
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,879
The Five Great Sects
can’t reach Mount Buzhou.

162
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,865
You don’t need to fear anything.

163
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,266
You don’t need to fear
the Five Great Sects.

164
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:15,719
You can use any method
to obtain the spirit keys.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,359
Yes, my lord.

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,279
The Sky Hall has been
in the shadows for too long.

167
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,650
It’s time for us to make an entrance.

168
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,770
Greetings, Master, Vice Palace Lord.

169
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,959
Si Feng, you’ve
mastered your skill.

170
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,936
I’m very relieved to hear that.

171
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,079
You were always the most talented.

172
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,850
As long as you aren’t distracted
and focus on your training,

173
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,599
I’m sure you’ll be the leader
of the Five Great Sects.

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,570
You’ll take over Lize Palace
sooner or later.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,869
My lord, your effort wasn’t wasted.

176
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,880
It’s good that you forced him
to choose this mask.

177
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,280
Yu Si Feng,

178
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,944
you mustn’t disappoint your
master and repeat the same mistakes.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,679
Let bygones be bygones.

180
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,079
Just forget about them.

181
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,159
I’m just reminding him.

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,586
Although the Loveless Mask
can render him emotionless

183
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,416
and stops him from having any feelings,

184
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,387
if he faces a situation where
he couldn’t control himself

185
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,178
and feels for someone,

186
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:09,752
a Loveless Curse will form
and he’ll be done for.

187
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,279
You only talk about useless things.

188
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,850
Si Feng, you do understand the
purpose of the Loveless Mask, right?

189
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,679
By getting rid of emotions, it will
save us from unnecessary trouble.

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,966
That’s good to hear.

191
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,370
And you must remember that

192
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,410
outsiders

193
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,090
are just like mirages.

194
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,959
Your only home is Lize Palace.

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,319
Yes, my lord...

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,535
I’m not finished yet.

197
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,292
All of you mustn’t risk
your lives for an illusion

198
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,767
that you cannot hold.

199
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,239
And create unnecessary trouble.

200
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,570
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

201
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,959
That’s enough.

202
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,319
Let’s return to the main point.

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,519
- Vice Palace Lord.
- Do you understand what to do?

204
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,530
Once you exit the palace tomorrow,
you should never break the rules.

205
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,512
I’ve received letters from Shaoyang Sect.

206
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:17,239
They stated that some demons
are causing trouble outside.

207
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,545
Coincidentally, you
will leave the palace soon.

208
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:21,436
Investigate the matter as well.

209
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,998
Those demons have
nothing to do with us.

210
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,402
They can’t reach Xiyang on either side.

211
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:33,138
If they want to create trouble
in Zhongyuan, just let them be.

212
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,839
Senior, you’re ignoring
everything except for our sect.

213
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,759
But you must respect
the other sect leaders as well.

214
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,730
Since we belong to
one of the Five Great Sects.

215
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,554
You make the shot.

216
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,559
Investigate the matter.

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,854
Yes.

218
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,937
Xuan Ji, you have
the Transmission Charm with you.

219
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,828
Do you know your task
when you leave the mountain?

220
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,373
- What’s my task?
- Silly Xuan Ji.

221
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:08,242
Senior Hao Chen wants you
to write letters to him.

222
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:11,052
But Senior Hao Chen,
we’ll be busy when we leave.

223
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,439
She’ll think it’s troublesome.

224
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,850
Or maybe she’ll forget about it.

225
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,649
Remember to write letters to me.

226
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,039
You’re pure and innocent.
You haven’t recovered your six senses.

227
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,647
The outside world is complex and chaotic.

228
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:29,279
I was reluctant to let you go,
but I have to abide by the rules.

229
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,570
If not...

230
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,519
So, after you leave, you need
to report to me every single detail.

231
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,519
Firstly, you can reflect on your progress.

232
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,139
Secondly, I can know
your progress as well.

233
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,759
Do you understand?

234
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,770
Yes, Senior Hao Chen.

235
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,174
You must be careful.

236
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,959
You two must remember this.

237
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,383
After you two leave the mountain,
you must deal with situations

238
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,059
according to your own capability.

239
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,430
You two mustn’t be reckless.

240
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,090
Xuan Ji, remember to listen to
your Sixth Senior.

241
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:10,315
Ling Long, you must
control your temper as well.

242
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,680
Father, I know that.

243
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:13,079
It’s the first time
you two are leaving here.

244
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,999
Your father is worried.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,155
You must remember his words.

246
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,930
Yes, I’ll remember them. I’ll leave now.

247
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,370
You!

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,479
This child...

249
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,039
Father, Aunt Ying Hong, Senior Hao Chen,

250
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,422
don’t worry. We know what to do.

251
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,319
Master, Aunt Ying Hong, don’t worry.

252
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,290
I’ll take good care of them.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,343
- Ling Long, wait for us!
- Ling Long!

254
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:41,673
Wait for me!

255
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,810
This is so beautiful!
We finally left the mountain!

256
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,282
This is too beautiful!

257
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,199
Senior Hao Chen, we
had another uneventful day.

258
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,759
Today, Sixth Senior ordered
a dish that was not tasty

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,130
at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.

260
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,916
It’s not delicious?

261
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,875
Fine, we won’t order that tomorrow.

262
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,092
We can save some money as well.

263
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,424
This is great!

264
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:03,559
We’ll go to Xishu tomorrow.
There are many delicious food over there.

265
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,090
There are pork trotter jelly,
cold noodles, and peppered chicken.

266
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,358
You’re going to finish our money soon.

267
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,399
We can only depend on Si Feng
in Lize Palace later on.

268
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,546
We’ve been out for seven days.

269
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:19,079
But there are no demons to be seen.

270
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,199
I don’t feel like a hero at all.

271
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,839
Look at the letters Xuan Ji
wrote for Senior Hao Chen.

272
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,450
I’m so happy today.
I’ve eaten a lot today.

273
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,878
Okay, we’ve finished
our mission for today.

274
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,764
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

275
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,536
Senior Hao Chen, we
had another uneventful day.

276
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,219
Today, Sixth Senior ordered
a dish that was not tasty

277
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,590
at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.

278
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,250
It’s lucky that the vegetables
were delicious.

279
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,970
I’m happy today.

280
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,410
Where are we? We should ask someone.

281
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,781
Excuse me.

282
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,039
Sorry for the interruption.

283
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,079
Judging by your attire,
I’m sure you are cultivators.

284
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,039
Do you know how long it will take
for us to reach Mount Shaoyang?

285
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,179
Mister, are you going to Mount Shaoyang
because there are demons around?

286
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,439
Yes.

287
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,090
We came from Wangxian Town.

288
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,503
Demons are wreaking havoc
in our town these days.

289
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,428
They cried in the middle of the night.

290
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,638
All of us were too afraid to go out.

291
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:33,319
This situation has lasted for
three months. This can’t continue on.

292
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,830
After that, a wandering priest
told us that

293
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:39,364
Shaoyang Sect is famous
for slaying demons.

294
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:43,119
That’s why we’re trying to
seek their help.

295
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,599
Wangxian Town?

296
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,759
We need to pass by there before
we reach Lize Palace and Xuanyuan Sect.

297
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,079
We can meet Si Feng
after we slay the demons.

298
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,279
This is great! We finally
have demons to slay!

299
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,781
Mister, we have decided
to slay the demons for you.

300
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:57,032
But...

301
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,669
You three are?

302
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,026
We’re members of the Shaoyang Sect.

303
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,305
This is our name tag.

304
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,952
Mister, please tell us more
about the demons.

305
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,719
We will try our best to help.

306
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,250
I think you are too young.

307
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,185
These two ladies look
very fresh and innocent.

308
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,239
I think you shouldn’t
sacrifice your lives for this.

309
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,199
I think we should seek for
your master’s help instead.

310
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,239
- Goodbye.
- Wait!

311
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,599
Mister, wait a minute.

312
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,079
We may look young, but we’re
famous in the pugilist world.

313
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,519
Especially this girl.

314
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,479
She may look weak and feeble,

315
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,433
but she can slay
dozens of demons at one go.

316
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,130
Dozens of demons?

317
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,039
- They’re pretty good.
- Sixth Senior,

318
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,580
since when could I slay dozens of demons?

319
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,759
You defeated Shadow Demon
and his clones, right?

320
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,279
That’s a different matter!

321
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,125
This is a rare chance.
We should grab hold of it.

322
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,410
I’m her senior.

323
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:54,655
As for her,

324
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,919
she’s not important.

325
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,239
Little Six!

326
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,979
We came down the mountain
in order to slay demons.

327
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,073
You don’t need to
travel far to seek help.

328
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:07,093
Since that’s the case, please help us out.

329
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,285
In Wangxian Town, there’s Mount Haiwan.

330
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,536
On that mountain, there’s a grass
called Zhuyu Grass.

331
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,370
And only our town has that grass.

332
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,044
But the strange thing is
it can’t be planted.

333
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,842
It can only grow on its own.

334
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,442
But three months ago,

335
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,493
some of our townsfolk went
to pick some Zhuyu Grass.

336
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,710
But all of them were
devoured by demons.

337
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:50,599
After that, some brave youngsters
went up the mountain as well.

338
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,257
But they never came back.

339
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,839
Mister, do you have any idea
what the demon looks like?

340
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,359
The demon always assaulted
people from the back.

341
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,359
That’s why nobody
has seen their true face.

342
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,337
I have a grandson
who only learnt how to speak recently.

343
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:10,890
Two days ago, he said
he saw a demon that cried.

344
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,506
It cries, it has two huge talons,
and it can fly as well.

345
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:18,479
But he’s just a child. I don’t think
we should treat this seriously.

346
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,045
It has wings,

347
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:23,005
and it cries as well?

348
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,999
Isn’t that scary?

349
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,593
Ling Long, look.

350
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:31,410
From the Demon Manual, a
demon who cries and has wings,

351
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,370
- it is a Quru Bird?
- Quru Bird?

352
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,330
But it didn’t state that the demon
likes to eat Zhuyu Grass.

353
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,827
Is it possible that someone is behind this

354
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:46,079
in order to obtain more provision?

355
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,143
Since that’s the case, we must act now.

356
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:49,354
Let’s check it out.

357
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,359
We must be cautious later on.

358
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,176
It’s just a Quru Bird.

359
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:04,890
Since it likes to eat, I’ll give it
a taste of my power.

360
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,583
I’m sure there are more than one of them.
We must be careful.

361
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,274
Even ten of them won’t scare me away.

362
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,890
It’s really desolate here.

363
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,970
Of course. There are demons
roaming around.

364
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,128
The Zhuyu Grass is pretty fragrant.

365
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:47,570
Ling Long, it’s such a waste
since Zhuyu Grass is delicious.

366
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,999
Xuan Ji, it’s dirty, you know?
Why are you eating it?

367
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,319
- Ling Long, it’s delicious. Try it.
- No way.

368
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,253
- Sixth Senior?
- I’ll skip this time.

369
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:56,787
Silly girl.

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,599
Ling Long, look.

371
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,827
The cuts are uneven.

372
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:03,591
I don’t think this is caused
by something sharp.

373
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,058
It looks like it was ripped.

374
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,319
You’re right.

375
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,719
- Look here.
- Seems like we’re facing a tough demon.

376
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,194
Little Six, why are you so timid?

377
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:14,445
- You’re afraid of this?
- You!

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,323
I smell a demon.

379
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,570
Watch out!

380
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,759
- It’s the Quru Bird!
- It has escaped!

381
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,968
Let’s chase after it!

382
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,129
What a strong demonic scent!

383
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,199
I smell that too.
It’s thick and disgusting.

384
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,439
It stinks!

385
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,850
It’s dark down there.
We don’t have a clear view.

386
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,066
- Xuan Ji!
- Ling Long, be careful!

387
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,479
Ling Long, are you okay?

388
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,856
I’m fine. You must be careful.

389
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,039
Little Six!

390
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,409
Ling Long!

391
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,119
Ling Long, are you okay?

392
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,373
I’m fine.

393
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,199
Be careful!

394
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,493
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

395
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,170
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

396
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,690
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

397
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,638
Si Feng?

398
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:19,897
Si Feng!

399
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:21,239
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

400
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,533
Xuan Ji!

401
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,383
Why are you bleeding?

402
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,675
I’m fine.

403
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:29,875
Silly girl, you’re not fine.

404
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,806
I’m Ruo Yu from Lize Palace.

405
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,119
Greetings.

406
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,970
Si Feng will return later, right?

407
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,228
Miss, Si Feng is...

408
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,510
We’re his friends. This is great.

409
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,538
I didn’t expect to see him here.

410
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,145
You said you were his friends?

411
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:47,604
That is bizarre.

412
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,300
What’s bizarre?

413
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:51,559
I heard that the members of

414
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,279
Lize Palace weren’t supposed
to make friends with outsiders, right?

415
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,523
But Si Feng is different from others.

416
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:59,010
- There are no exceptions.
- Si Feng is an exception.

417
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,519
Si Feng!

418
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,839
Did you capture it?

419
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,959
The Quru Bird fled because
it was frightened.

420
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,251
It fled?

421
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,559
It’s all because of you three.

422
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,423
- You!
- Save your breath.

423
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:14,714
Ruo Yu, let’s go.

424
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,948
Si Feng!

425
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,330
Si Feng, is this really you?

426
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,919
You got yourself a new mask.

427
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,799
I almost couldn’t recognize you.

428
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,218
I thought my skills would’ve been
better after four years.

429
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,039
I thought I could protect everyone.

430
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,682
But I didn’t expect you
to improve this much.

431
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,490
You saved me once again.

432
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,266
Quru Birds hunt in groups.

433
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,709
We need a tactic to hunt them down.

434
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,239
Next time, you
better prepare yourselves.

435
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,570
Don’t create trouble for other people.

436
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,199
Si Feng, my brother, long time no see.

437
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,039
Si Feng, it’s been four years
since we have met.

438
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,847
We wanted to find you in Lize Palace.

439
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,683
Let go! All of you,
stay away from Si Feng!

440
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,199
You’re rude! Who exactly are you?

441
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,759
That is none of your concern.

442
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,081
Please calm down.

443
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:05,879
She is Miss Lu Yan Ran
from Dianjinggu Sect.

444
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,358
She was separated from her friends.

445
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,039
That’s why she’s travelling with us.

446
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,639
- We...
- We’re not here to save you.

447
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,021
We prepared an ambush for the demons.

448
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,775
We were waiting for them
to return to their nest.

449
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,928
But you just came
and went all out on them.

450
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,455
And that messed up our plan.

451
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,331
How should we know you have a plan?

452
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:23,714
You speak as if this is our fault.

453
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,004
Wasn’t it your fault?

454
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,540
Si Feng, since we didn’t
manage to find their nest,

455
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:32,039
we should return to our inn and rest.

456
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,049
Sure! Where are you staying?
We can stay together.

457
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,791
And we can travel together afterwards.

458
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:39,322
We’re not going on the same path.

459
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,319
Miss Xuan Ji, first, we need to help
Miss Lu find her friends.

460
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,599
So, it’s inconvenient for us
to travel together.

461
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,959
Please forgive us.

462
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,495
Save your breath. Let’s go.

463
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:50,737
Si Feng, are you leaving us?

464
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:52,064
We missed you.

465
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,159
And we’ve finally met after so long.
Please don’t leave.

466
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,319
That’s right. Why are you leaving us?

467
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,493
Si Feng, are you angry
at us because Xuan Ji

468
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:02,024
didn’t contact you at all?

469
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,639
Yes. Ling Long said you
must’ve been waiting for my news.

470
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,679
Si Feng, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

471
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,159
- But the Sound Bell...
- No.

472
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,995
I lost mine as well.

473
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:15,646
It’s an useless item.

474
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,304
That’s good. I knew it.

475
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,882
Si Feng, you were so busy.

476
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:23,136
There’s no need for us
to contact each other, right?

477
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,927
- Since we’ll meet anyway.
- I’m busy indeed.

478
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:27,879
I won’t waste any time here.

479
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,917
- Si Feng!
- Everyone, farewell for now.

480
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,290
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

481
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,690
- Xuan Ji, what’s wrong?
- Xuan Ji!

482
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,424
What’s going on?

483
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,079
Xuan Ji was poisoned.

484
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,770
Wait, Quru Birds aren’t poisonous.

485
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,999
Si Feng, seems like
Miss Xuan Ji has a serious injury.

486
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,519
We...

487
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,866
Are we going to leave them for real?

488
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,355
Si Feng, I heard that your sect
is an expert in neutralising poison.

489
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,166
Are you really going to ignore her?

490
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,290
Little Six, will Xuan Ji be fine?

491
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,119
But the Demon Manual stated
that Quru Birds aren’t poisonous.

492
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,719
How did this happen?

493
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,954
You’re right.

494
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,439
That’s why we suspect that
someone is manipulating them.

495
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,839
And the manipulator must’ve applied
poison on their talons.

496
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,959
We would’ve captured that demon
if it weren’t for someone.

497
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,759
But in the end? We’re stuck here
because of them.

498
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,158
Such bad luck.

499
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,062
What do you mean by that?
Si Feng is our old friend.

500
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,279
We will travel together sooner or later.

501
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,514
And we still have plenty of things
to catch up as well.

502
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,086
You can leave if you don’t want to stay.

503
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,559
You are thinking too much.

504
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,359
Si Feng has nothing to catch up
with you.

505
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,799
Didn’t you see that?
He ignored you just now.

506
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,985
- You!
- To me, you are here because the Quru Birds are too strong

507
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,783
and you wanted to seek Si Feng’s help
to defeat them.

508
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:19,079
- You!
- Some people are useless by themselves.

509
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,919
That’s why they want to seek help
from Lize Palace.

510
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,174
I...

511
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,384
What?

512
00:34:26,385 --> 00:34:27,676
Stop it now.

513
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,539
Si Feng.

514
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,010
Si Feng, don’t leave.

515
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,450
Si Feng.

516
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,781
Don’t leave me.

517
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:50,599
I had just neutralized the poison.

518
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,770
You better not move around.

519
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,640
Si Feng, I know you’re angry.

520
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,599
I was too dumb.

521
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,798
When I went to Xuyang Peak
for my training with Senior Hao Chen,

522
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:13,388
he confiscated the Sound Bell you gave me

523
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:16,679
because he didn’t want me
to be distracted.

524
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,211
And I didn’t think of other ways
I could use to contact people.

525
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:23,768
That’s why I didn’t write one letter
to Ling Long nor Sixth Senior.

526
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,519
Ling Long was very angry with me.

527
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,210
You don’t need to explain that to me.

528
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,610
It’s fine even if
we didn’t contact each other.

529
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,860
Si Feng, why are you
still trying to leave?

530
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:37,211
We wanted to find you
in Lize Palace initially.

531
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:39,434
Isn’t it a great thing when
we meet each other here?

532
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:41,479
Why are you still insisting on leaving?

533
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,399
Why must we stay together?

534
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,567
Because we made a promise.

535
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:49,690
The four of us are
going to travel together, right?

536
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,582
So childish.

537
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,690
Is that so?

538
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,290
But after that, I realized that

539
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,273
nothing is permanent in this world.

540
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,330
Same goes for a friend’s promise.

541
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,079
Si Feng.

542
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,279
I don’t understand.

543
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,879
- Initially...
- I did promise you

544
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,823
that I’ll find the Mirror of Origin
with you initially.

545
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,194
And I will keep my promise.

546
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,959
I obtained one shard by accident.

547
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,123
Here.

548
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,610
Si Feng, I didn’t mean that.

549
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,450
And, regarding the Mirror of Origin,

550
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,370
I don’t need it

551
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,330
anymore.

552
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,711
Senior Hao Chen said that
I will become obsessed

553
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:42,119
with desire and
greed if I search for it.

554
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,799
It’s not good for my training.

555
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,420
So, I promised Senior Hao Chen
that I won’t search for it anymore

556
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,631
after I leave the mountain.

557
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,850
But Si Feng, I still need to thank you.

558
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,339
So,

559
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
you don’t want to recover
your six senses anymore.

560
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,250
I was born without them.

561
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:11,447
I think it’s fine even if
I don’t recover them.

562
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,010
They don’t seem that important to me.

563
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:20,064
The current Chu Xuan Ji isn’t
that bad anyway, am I right?

564
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,450
The human heart is indecisive

565
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,854
and unstable.

566
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,638
I’ve witnessed it for myself.

567
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:29,323
Si Feng, what did you say?

568
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:31,345
Since it’s useless to you,

569
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,530
that means we don’t need to meet anymore.

570
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,290
Farewell.

571
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,079
Si Feng!

572
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,558
Si Feng, don’t leave us!

573
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,119
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji.

574
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,759
Xuan Ji, why are you here?

575
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,742
Si Feng, did you neutralize the poison?

576
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,920
She can move after some rest.

577
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,719
You may leave after some time.

578
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,253
We’ll handle the Quru Birds. Let’s go.

579
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,646
- Wait, Si Feng.
- Si Feng.

580
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,079
What do you mean by this?

581
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,559
Aren’t we your companions?

582
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,769
That’s right. I thought we were going to
capture them together?

583
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,566
There’s no need for this many people.
It’s troublesome.

584
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,039
That’s not the point.

585
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,479
Si Feng, I thought
this is a happy occasion?

586
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,949
But why are you treating us
like the plague?

587
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,319
You’re trying to avoid us.

588
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,158
Si Feng, what’s wrong with you?

589
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,056
Si Feng, there’s no need for explanations.

590
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,359
Let’s go.

591
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,708
Si Feng!

592
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:26,567
What’s going on?
Why are they approaching us?

593
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:27,877
There are so many of them!

594
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:29,403
There are too many of them!

595
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:30,694
Set up the barrier!

596
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,610
Why are there so many Quru Birds?

597
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,279
Didn’t you say someone
was manipulating them?

598
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,634
They’re still not leaving
even after the barrier was set up.

599
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:45,359
I’m afraid they’re trying to trap us here.

600
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,999
You won’t be trapped
if you’re capable enough to break through.

601
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,222
Hero Zhong, you’re quite skilled.

602
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,849
But it’s hard when you have
two amateurs around.

603
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:54,909
Stop looking down on us!

604
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,554
You can leave if you’re that capable!

605
00:38:56,555 --> 00:39:00,759
We’ll deal with the birds and the demon
once Xuan Ji recovers her strength.

606
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,959
Miss Lu, it’s fine.
We can escape by ourselves.

607
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,119
Silly girl, she’s not saying that
out of concern!

608
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,159
These Quru Birds
all came out of their nests.

609
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,319
And their talons were coated with poison.

610
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,159
It’s too risky to try and break through.

611
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,968
Si Feng, what do you think?

612
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,799
We’ll just destroy their nest then.

613
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,119
- Are you going to use that?
- We must deal with the mastermind first.

614
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,771
It’s better for us to
end this fast as well.

615
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,718
Si Feng, what are you doing?

616
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,679
He’s going to cast the secret spell
of Lize Palace, Soul Chaser.

617
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,599
It can detect the location
of the culprit behind this.

618
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,759
Inside the palace,
among the stars,

619
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,074
chase the cursed soul,
with the speed of the wind.

620
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,395
Search!

621
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,050
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng, are you okay?

622
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,719
To the west, there are ten caves.

623
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,383
Take the middle cave,
and you’ll reach a valley.

624
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:31,549
The demon manipulating
the birds is located there.

625
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,774
I’ve injured the demon
and he can’t move around.

626
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:35,919
You can go and capture him.

627
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,686
Si Feng, we’ll let them go
since they wish to capture it so badly.

628
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,799
Your breathing is a mess.
You need to recuperate.

629
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,799
- I’ll stay here and guard over you.
- No need.

630
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,599
That demon is quite powerful.
All of you should go.

631
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,612
- But what if something...
- Stop wasting time!

632
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:51,159
If the demon flees,
I’ll blame it all on you.

633
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,401
Be careful then.
Send us a signal if you’re in danger.

634
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:54,719
Let’s go.

635
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,679
- Si Feng, you...
- Xuan Ji, let’s go.

636
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,868
I...

637
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,665
Si Feng, are you okay?

638
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,039
Why are you here?

639
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,359
I’ve thought about it.
I can’t leave you alone here.

640
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,050
I’ll stay by your side
until you get better.

641
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,194
No need.

642
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,330
Si Feng, you mustn’t rush
the recovery process.

643
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,365
Don’t move. It’s dangerous for you
to activate your energy by force.

644
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,293
Si Feng, why is your breathing
getting more and more unstable?

645
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:50,519
Do you feel uncomfortable?
Are you in pain?

646
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,909
Why are you sweating so much?

647
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,810
This won’t do. I need to
transfer some of my energy to you.

648
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,298
- But your mask...
- Don’t touch it!

649
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,130
- I want to help you.
- You’re helping me by not touching it.

650
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,250
I knew it. Si Feng was still angry at me
for not contacting him.

651
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,279
What should I do to appease him?

652
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,431
Oh right, what did Sixth
Senior do every time

653
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,562
he makes Ling Long angry?

654
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,421
Si Feng.

655
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,395
Why are you sweating so much?

656
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:27,966
You’ll catch a cold.

657
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,192
Here.

658
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,279
What are you doing?

659
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,341
Si Feng, I’m wiping away your sweat.

660
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:41,888
You’ll catch a cold like this.

661
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,367
I’m not trying to scold you,
but you’re not taking care of yourself.

662
00:42:44,368 --> 00:42:45,938
You can’t do anything without me around.

663
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,316
My sweat is gone.

664
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,454
Si Feng, this dried fruit is very sweet.

665
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:00,546
I can’t even bear to eat it.
I kept it specially for you.

666
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:01,757
Try it.

667
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,703
Chu Xuan Ji, what exactly
are you trying to do?

668
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:09,148
I... I’m trying to
make you happy.

669
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:10,439
I’m trying to coax you.

670
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,312
Please don’t be angry anymore.

671
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:14,083
Please don’t hold it against me.

672
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,587
Si Feng.

673
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,759
Isn’t this funny?

674
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,412
Si Feng, please smile.

675
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,092
You’ll get younger when you smile.

676
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,319
Si Feng.

677
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,770
Chu Xuan Ji, that’s enough.

678
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,919
Isn’t this funny?

679
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,730
Never mind. I have another trick.

680
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,330
Si Feng, let me tell you a joke.

681
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:50,879
Listen closely.

682
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,399
Once, there was a phoenix
who tried to attain nirvana.

683
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,679
Guess what happened in the end?

684
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,976
Listen carefully.

685
00:43:56,977 --> 00:43:59,027
It overheated!

686
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,759
Isn’t it funny?

687
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,052
Si Feng, isn’t that funny?

688
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,536
It’s funny, right?

689
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:04,867
Answer me.

690
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,199
It’s not funny?

691
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,434
I have another trick up my sleeve.

692
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:11,879
Si Feng, look.

693
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,999
I’ve hidden a treasure in one of my hand.

694
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,970
Take a guess. If you’re
correct, I’ll give you the treasure.

695
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,279
You think it’s this hand, right?

696
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,490
You’re wrong. There’s nothing inside.

697
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,028
Are you done?

698
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,879
Si Feng, don’t be angry.

699
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,673
Although you’re wrong, I hate
it when our Si Feng gets angry.

700
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,710
So, even though you’re wrong,
I’ll still give you the treasure.

701
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,219
Are they nice?

702
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,966
Sixth Senior used this trick
every time when Ling Long was angry,

703
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,330
and he succeeds every time.

704
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,925
I like Sixth Senior.

705
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:54,180
Min Yan?

706
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,511
You like Min Yan?

707
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,359
Chu Xuan Ji, listen carefully.

708
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,610
I’m not angry.

709
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:12,999
You can stop your silly acts.

710
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,526
Si Feng, you’re not angry?

711
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:17,096
Why are you acting like this then?

712
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,148
Why did you change so much?

713
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:22,044
You don’t want us
to be your friends anymore?

714
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:23,375
Do you hate me now?

715
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,690
The pupils of Lize Palace weren’t
supposed to have friends anyway.

716
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,339
There’s nothing for me to like or hate.

717
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,279
Four years are a long time.

718
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,530
It’s normal for people to grow and change.

719
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,839
There’s no need to dwell on the past.

720
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,517
No, you weren’t like this in the past.

721
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,801
We had plenty of things
to talk about in the past.

722
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:47,219
And many things we could share.

723
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,790
You taught me many things as well.

724
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,195
Si Feng, you even told me that

725
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:54,126
meeting me was the best thing
that had happened in your life.

726
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,570
Although I was asleep,
I did hear what you say.

727
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,959
I was rash then.

728
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,213
I never think before I speak.

729
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:04,559
You mustn’t hold it to your heart.

730
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,679
- It’s meaningless.
- It’s not.

731
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,919
The past you, and everything you had said,

732
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,735
all of them were meaningful to me.

733
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:12,652
I don’t want our relationship to change.

734
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,383
Si Feng, I don’t want to lose you.
