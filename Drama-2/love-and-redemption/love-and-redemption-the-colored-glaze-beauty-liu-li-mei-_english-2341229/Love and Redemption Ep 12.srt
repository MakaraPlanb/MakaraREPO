00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,260
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,880
<i>EPISODE 12</i>

3
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,271
It’s gone.

4
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,339
Thank you for sparing me.

5
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,565
I’m leaving.

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,060
She’s still young and immature.
Thanks, Little Phoenix.

7
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:15,895
Yu Er!

8
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,119
- Let me go!
- Let you go?

9
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,519
Are you going to run away again
if I let you go?

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,755
Couldn’t you thank him
for saving your life?

11
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,279
What if you get caught by
the bad guys again?

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,799
That’s my problem!

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,359
You’re not willing to accept me.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
And you kept avoiding me.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,599
Why are you pretending
to be a good father now?

16
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,999
I don’t need one!

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,399
Let me go, you old fogey!

18
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,919
You didn’t care about me
when I was still alive.

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,740
Now that I’m dead,
you can’t stop bothering me.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,879
Yu Er.

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,319
It’s my fault that I couldn’t be with you.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,159
Now I can’t leave you alone.

23
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,860
From now on, I
won’t let you go again.

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,449
Let’s go.

25
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:08,039
A demon saved Elder Ling Shi?

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,639
Xuan Ji, did you make a mistake?

27
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,759
No. I’ve never come across
such a strong demonic aura.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,999
Whether a demon
has caught Ling Shi or not,

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,690
we should head to Xuanyuan Sect
and inform Elder Zhu Shi of what he did.

30
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,088
Si Feng. Xuan Ji.

31
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:22,340
We’ll head to Xuanyuan Sect.

32
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:23,871
As for the rest,

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,140
wait for us in the town.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,359
Min Yan.

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,159
I’ve said so.

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,079
You need to care about Xuan Ji’s feelings.

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
But I need to explain myself.

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,310
You should stay in the town
and give it a thought,

39
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:41,183
in case your insincere
words hurt others and yourself.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,439
Ruo Yu. Yan Ran.

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,560
Take Min Yan to the town.

42
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,237
Don’t let him follow us.

43
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:49,199
Si Feng.

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,019
Min Yan, let’s go.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,370
This is utter nonsense.

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,660
Wait for me!

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,812
Wait for me.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,879
Ling Long.

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,244
Ling Long!

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,353
Does Ling Long have something on her mind?

51
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,547
She’s ignoring me.

52
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,173
Something is bothering her.

53
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,559
That’s why she’s acting that way.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,122
What’s bothering her?

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,729
We’re here. Let’s get down now.

56
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,021
<i>XUANYUAN</i>

57
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,135
Please wait for a moment.

58
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,563
I’ll go inform of your arrival.

59
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,199
No one is training.
And the ground isn’t swept.

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,807
That’s so outrageous.

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,399
The censer has gone out of use.

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,539
It seems that they haven’t
burnt any incense for days.

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,154
Sect Leader is inviting you to go in.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,612
Sect Leader.

65
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:20,319
You’ve travelled all the way here.

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,927
Why are you here?

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,315
Sect Leader can’t talk
because he’s caught a cold.

68
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,264
That’s why I’m asking on his behalf.

69
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,559
I came uninvited
for an urgent matter.

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,839
We went down the mountain for training.

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,999
While passing by Wangxian Town,

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,959
we saw someone controlled
the demon spirits to drink human blood,

73
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,319
and grow Jialuo blood fruits.

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,296
We investigated and found out
that it’s Elder Ling Shi’s doing.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,199
As juniors, we dared not act recklessly.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,999
We’re afraid it’d tarnish
Xuanyuan Sect’s reputation.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,839
That’s why we came to inform
Sect Leader Zhu Shi of it.

78
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,118
Got it.

79
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,079
Our sect will see to it.

80
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
Don’t worry yourselves with it.

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,639
We almost got killed.

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,239
You don’t look concerned
at all, Elder Mo Shi.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,738
I don’t need you
to teach me how to settle it.

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,319
Since the fellow elders have found out,

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,145
there’s nothing else to talk about.

86
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,486
We’re leaving.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,546
No rush.

88
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,239
You came all the way.

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,132
I think you should stay for
a vegetarian meal.

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,307
All three of you went down
the mountain for training.

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,999
How many of you?

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,719
Six persons in total.

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,079
The other companions are waiting
in the town for our return.

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,679
We’re afraid we’d get into danger again.

95
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,999
That’s why we came up with a plan.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,064
If we don’t go back by this evening,

97
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,771
those three persons will inform
the sect of our disappearance.

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,559
If so, I won’t make you stay.

99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,479
Xuanyuan Sect will catch Ling Shi soonest.

100
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,834
We’ll give you an explanation.

101
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:09,504
Guys, see yourselves out.

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,515
Wait.

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,519
I might need your
help for something.

104
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,439
The wife of Lord of Fuyu Island
is having her birthday banquet soon.

105
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,079
My men are too busy to send her the gift.

106
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,069
Thus, I’d like you all

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,146
to send this gift to Lord Dong Fang.

108
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,820
- See the guests out.
- Wait.

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,119
It’s a gift to Fuyu Island.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,439
And it has to do with the face of my sect.

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,324
Sect Leader isn’t feeling so well.

112
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,039
He might miss something out.

113
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,526
I’ll take a look at it
again for Sect Leader.

114
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,399
There’s not much time.

115
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,879
But you managed to remain courteous.

116
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,553
It seems that I was
worried for nothing.

117
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,656
If so,

118
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,992
please see yourselves out.

119
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,359
Xuanyuan Sect is so weird.

120
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,607
They made me feel uncomfortable.

121
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,479
Oh right, Si Feng.

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,759
Why did you say that
if we’re not back before dark,

123
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,119
those waiting in the town
would inform the sect of it?

124
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,859
I don’t remember we made that arrangement.

125
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,639
I found Xuanyuan
Sect strange too.

126
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,639
That’s why I said that.

127
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,825
Maybe I was worried for nothing.

128
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,524
<i>XUANYUAN SECT</i>

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,359
Please calm down,
my fellow divine messengers.

130
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,399
Sect Leader...

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,239
Sect Leader did so to get rid of
the suspicion of the five sects.

132
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,639
- That’s why he sent that gift.
- Yes.

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,439
I’ve checked on it.
There’s nothing wrong about it.

134
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,079
You need not worry,
my fellow divine messengers.

135
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,719
Sect Leader, you mustn’t do
such an unexpected thing again.

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,519
Hand over the spirit keys.

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,759
And Xuanyuan Sect will be saved.

138
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,959
Xuanyuan Sect has gone
for a thousand years.

139
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,352
Whether it can exist after that,

140
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,203
that depends on fate.

141
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,679
Instead of being controlled by demons

142
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,731
and existing on the brink of collapse,

143
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,570
it’d rather die an honourable death.

144
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,199
Do you stop your sect
from being honourable?

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,599
My fellow divine messengers.

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,959
Sect Leader is just being stubborn.

147
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,279
Perhaps he hasn’t figured out
your compliments to him.

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,599
Please allow me a few more days.

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,879
I promise that I’ll
persuade Sect Leader

150
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,278
to hand over the spirit keys.

151
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,199
I don’t have to remind you all.

152
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,879
The deadline is in three days.

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,836
You don’t have much time left.

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,650
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader!

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,959
Go away.

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,439
Sect Leader, the poison
is going to attack your body.

157
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,839
Why can’t you stop being stubborn?

158
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,479
That’s right, Sect Leader.

159
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,319
Stop being stubborn.

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,639
Based on what those young people said,

161
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,519
Ling Shi’s method
isn’t going to work soon.

162
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,604
Today, another ten
Xuanyuan disciples have died.

163
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,005
Do you want all of our
disciples to be killed?

164
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,698
Yes, Sect Leader.

165
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:20,524
Xuanyuan Sect made a mistake.

166
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,361
We can’t make another one.

167
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,399
You’re back.

168
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,519
You’re hungry, aren’t you?

169
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,912
I’ve prepared us supper.
Let’s eat together.

170
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,239
I’m a bit tired. I’m going to bed first.

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,620
Ling Long.

172
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,399
Ling Long.

173
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,559
Si Feng.

174
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,759
I have something to tell you.

175
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,736
It’s very important. I have to say it now.

176
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,679
Master. Green Feather
marks are on your wrist.

177
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,959
And the Loveless Curse
is now in your body.

178
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,879
I knew you’d find it out.

179
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,980
Don’t tell Xuan Ji about it.

180
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,119
Now isn’t the time to care about her!

181
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,439
I don’t care.

182
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,279
You can’t stay here anymore.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,851
Let’s go. We’ll go back to Lizhe Palace.

184
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,585
And we won’t come back again, okay?

185
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,296
Then,

186
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,279
we’ll lock ourselves
in Lizhe Palace forever.

187
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,079
I’d rather die.

188
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,256
You won’t die.

189
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,879
It takes three attacks from Loveless Curse
for the blood to flow backwards.

190
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,916
If you don’t get hurt by love,
the curse won’t attack and you’ll be fine.

191
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,384
That’s right.

192
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,759
That’s why I think I can still manage it.

193
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,298
What are you worried about?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,279
But Chu Xuan Ji is unreliable.

195
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,319
She doesn’t love you at all.

196
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,923
You shouldn’t have
fallen in love with her.

197
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:02,639
And you’re in a complicated
relationship with her.

198
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,839
She’ll get you killed, Master!

199
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,199
Silver Snake.

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,504
You’re getting unruly.

201
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,205
Please calm down, Master.

202
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,547
You’re fortunate enough

203
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:15,599
to cultivate yourself a human form.
And it’s not easy.

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,799
That’s why I let you pretend
to be a Dianjinggu disciple

205
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,682
and train with me.

206
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,279
You’re not here to control me.

207
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,821
You can’t restrain me
or meddle with my affairs.

208
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,319
Because I... I don’t
understand your decision.

209
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,606
I want you to stay alive, Master.

210
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,479
You’re right.

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,753
I should stay alive.

212
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,239
You’re my spirit beast.

213
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
Our six senses are connected.

214
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,940
Can you not feel how happy I am.

215
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,985
Get up.

216
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,959
Silver Snake.

217
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,319
Did you know?

218
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,712
The moment I put on the Loveless Mask,

219
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,380
I thought I’d never
be happy again.

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,399
I was scared that
the curse would take my life.

221
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,297
That it would control me.

222
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,345
But now I’m very happy and carefree.

223
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:17,359
I was presumptuous enough
to make this decision.

224
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,215
I let myself fall in love with her.

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,404
All this

226
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,780
is my decision.

227
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,199
No matter what happens in
the future, I’ll bear all the cost.

228
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,919
And I won’t regret.

229
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,457
Do you understand now?

230
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,039
I do.

231
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,759
But you’ll die eventually.

232
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,759
I don’t want you to die, Master.

233
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
I don’t want!

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,079
Stop being so dramatic.

235
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,660
Nobody is dying here.

236
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,319
Silver Snake.

237
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,319
We used to go up
the heavenly realm together.

238
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,605
Can you be more polite to me?

239
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,319
If your hand slips and
you accidentally kill me,

240
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,479
you master is dead meat.

241
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,279
Brother Liu.

242
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,450
You haven’t gotten rid of
the bad habit of eavesdropping.

243
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,239
If it hadn’t been for
my eavesdropping habit,

244
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,799
I wouldn’t found out your lifeline.

245
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,095
Lifeline?

246
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,912
What lifeline?

247
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,608
Of course it’s a lifeline that breaks
your master’s Loveless Curse.

248
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,319
You’re kidding me, Brother Liu.

249
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,839
There’s no way to break it.

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,279
Little Phoenix.

251
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,959
You’re very lucky indeed.

252
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,599
On the day I sneaked into
Lizhe Palace to visit you,

253
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,719
I eavesdropped on the conversation between
the palace lord and the vice palace lord.

254
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,439
And I found out that there’s
a secret chamber in Lizhe Palace.

255
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,039
And there’s a dossier
in that secret chamber.

256
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,119
And the dossier records
the solution to Loveless Curse.

257
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,359
What’s the solution?

258
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,767
I’ll do whatever it takes
to break the curse for Master.

259
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,399
Well, it has nothing
to do with you.

260
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,319
The only person who can
save your master is Chu Xuan Ji.

261
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,467
Chu Xuan Ji?

262
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:19,319
We all know that when
the curse starts working,

263
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,539
one’s blood will flow backwards and die
if he gets hurt by love for thrice.

264
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,239
And the mask will turn into a crying face.

265
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,439
It’s impossible for one
to not get hurt by love.

266
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,119
Thus, this curse became a death curse.

267
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,519
And that’s the reason why
there’s a lifeline.

268
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,399
If the one you love
treats you with all her heart

269
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,119
and is loyal to you, she
can take off your mask.

270
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,597
And the mask will
turn into a smiling face.

271
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,439
Why so?

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,100
I’ve never heard of
this solution to Loveless Curse.

273
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,765
Well...

274
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,279
Because only the two palace lords
can enter the secret chamber.

275
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,999
Naturally, they don’t believe
there are loyal partners in the world.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,799
That’s why they’ve never brought it up.
That’s normal.

277
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,619
I’m bring her here to
take off my master’s mask.

278
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,919
Here’s the main point.

279
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,279
They have to love each other.

280
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,119
- They have to love each other?
- Thus, I’m reminding you.

281
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,814
You’d better not act recklessly.

282
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:21,159
There’s only one chance
to take the mask off.

283
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,900
No second chance.

284
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,879
Little Phoenix.

285
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
Your life depends on

286
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,469
whether you can make Chu Xuan Ji
fall in love with all her heart.

287
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,639
Thank you, Brother Liu.

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,239
For giving me a solution.

289
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,696
I really appreciate it.

290
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,631
- Don’t mention it.
- But you do know that

291
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,839
Xuan Ji has someone else in her heart.

292
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,039
I’ve fallen deeply in love with her.

293
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,630
It has nothing to do with her.

294
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,780
I can’t force her
for my own sake.

295
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,934
Look at yourself.

296
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,587
Look at yourself.

297
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,999
You’ve never troubled others.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,811
You’re a man who
endures everything alone.

299
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,399
But when it comes to love,
you’ve got to listen to me.

300
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,479
You need to be aggressive
when courting a lady.

301
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,399
I Have come across many women.

302
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,079
I think Chu Xuan Ji is a confused
girl who’s ignorant of love.

303
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,759
She seems to know nothing about love.

304
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,220
Therefore, you need not
take small fights seriously.

305
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,853
I have faith in our Little Phoenix.

306
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:34,702
It’s not as hard as you think it is.

307
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,639
I, Zhong Min Yan,
only care about Chu Ling Long.

308
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,980
I’m not apologising.

309
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:53,639
You feel the same way about me.
Why don’t you admit it?

310
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,869
Can we stop lying to ourselves?

311
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,279
Brother Liu. You said Ling Long and
Sixth Senior fought because of me.

312
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,839
Why so?

313
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,999
Don’t you see that your silly
sister and that silly Zhong Min Yan

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,329
like each other?

315
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:28,279
But Ling Long and
Sixth Senior fight all the time.

316
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,159
I thought she didn’t like him at all.

317
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,999
Isn’t it great if they like each other?

318
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,439
But Brother Liu, why do they fight
even though they like each other?

319
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,159
All three of us live happily together.

320
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,887
Isn’t that great?

321
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,719
What’s so great about it?

322
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,519
Can you see that
Ling Long has lost her appetite

323
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,599
because she’s very upset that
Zhong Min Yan likes both of you.

324
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,639
That’s impossible.
Ling Long is very generous.

325
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,639
I enjoy eating drumsticks. So does she.

326
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,439
We share our drumsticks all the time.
Sharing is caring.

327
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,347
Are you ignorant or pretending to be so?

328
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,519
There are many things in this world
that can’t be shared

329
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,599
Especially one’s loved one.
That can’t be shared.

330
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,881
Who said so?

331
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:22,640
Ling Long and I like Father.
And she’s not mad about it.

332
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,599
Little Xuan Ji.

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,959
Humans are very greedy.

334
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,959
There are many kinds of likes.

335
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,999
You like drumsticks.
And I like drinks.

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,079
You like your father.
And I like Little Phoenix.

337
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,728
Yet, someone will make you
forget about all these likes.

338
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,333
You still don’t get it?

339
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,319
Let me put it this way.

340
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,799
If you were to travel alone
to a desert island

341
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,559
and stay there forever,

342
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,759
you could take someone along
to keep you company.

343
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,319
That’s the one whom
you wouldn’t share with others.

344
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,079
Would you abandon Ling Long

345
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,628
and stay on the desert island
with Min Yan forever?

346
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,959
That means he’s not the one.

347
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,599
The one and the only.

348
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,759
Someone who can’t be shared.

349
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,399
Ling Long seems to treat
Min Yan differently.

350
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,588
And Min Yan seems to treat
Ling Long differently.

351
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,707
Did I really make a mistake?

352
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,180
Fill her bowl.

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,738
Fill her bowl.

354
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,306
Si Feng said vegetables
help you grow taller.

355
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,279
Ling Long.

356
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,655
What happened yesterday
between you and Sixth Senior?

357
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,653
We...

358
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,306
- Here.
- Leave me be.

359
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,534
I can’t do it.

360
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,639
Why did you say it out loud?

361
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,094
How embarrassing.

362
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,839
What’s so embarrassing about it?

363
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,319
All these years,
whenever I see you,

364
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,799
I feel like catching a glimpse of
you and talking to you more often.

365
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,719
I feel happy even when we’re bantering.

366
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,599
Today, I’d like to make
things clear in front of you all.

367
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,198
I like you.

368
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,519
I’ve said so. If you
let Xuan Ji down, I’ll kill you.

369
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,079
Go ahead and kill me then.

370
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,399
I’d tell the same thing to anyone.

371
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,959
There’s nothing between me and Xuan Ji.

372
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,519
- You...
- I only have you in my heart.

373
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,799
You shut up! You...

374
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,213
Ling Long.

375
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,519
Sixth Senior is telling the truth.

376
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,919
What nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,319
I promised Mother that I’ll protect you.

378
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,639
No one can bully you.

379
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,759
No one is bullying me.

380
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,839
I’ve made a mistake.

381
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,439
I thought I liked Sixth Senior.

382
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,977
Actually, it’s all a misunderstanding.

383
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,287
Misunderstanding?

384
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,640
You told me that

385
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,599
one feels like seeing
the person she likes every day.

386
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,359
When I was locked inside the Mingxia Cave,

387
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,799
I just recovered my sense of taste

388
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,959
and Sixth Senior sent me
good foods every day.

389
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,839
That’s why I feel like
seeing him all the time.

390
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,199
I thought I liked him.

391
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
But I found out that
I was just craving for foods.

392
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,479
I then thought about it.

393
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,359
Sixth Senior didn’t make those foods.

394
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,959
They’re prepared by the cook in our sect.

395
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,159
Does that mean I like the cook?

396
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,439
Xuan Ji.

397
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,450
Is this the reason why you...

398
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,879
Yes! I just found out yesterday

399
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,959
that the like between you and Sixth Senior

400
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,519
is a unique one which can’t be shared.

401
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,799
I’m different. There are
many people whom I like.

402
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,319
Thus, Ling Long, I’m returning
this dagger to its owner.

403
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,639
Don’t ever fight again, okay?

404
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,780
Here, sit down and eat your food.

405
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,559
No.

406
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,820
If you don’t like each other,
why did you hug each other on that day?

407
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,479
Zhong Min Yan, you still wanted to
take advantage of my sister!

408
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,011
- I...
- Ling Long!

409
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,279
That’s not what happened.

410
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,986
Do you still remember the incident
where Gudiao was killed at Mount Lutai?

411
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,891
Actually, I killed it.

412
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:01,239
Xuan Ji.

413
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,079
Sixth Senior, you need not
keep this secret of mine anymore.

414
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,923
I killed Aoyin at Mount Haiwan

415
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:10,904
with the blue light,
which isn’t the Yang Jue Skill.

416
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,639
It’s a kind of strange power
which I know nothing about.

417
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,759
It made me lose my consciousness.

418
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,564
I don’t remember what happened afterwards.

419
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,092
Sixth Senior saw it.

420
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:30,013
He’s afraid I’d be seen as a freak.
That’s why he kept this secret.

421
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,599
We’re wondering if it has anything
to do with the Mirror of Origin?

422
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,599
We thought of destroying that mirror

423
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,879
so that these weird things
wouldn’t happen again.

424
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,119
On that day, we tried to
destroy the mirror at the inn.

425
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,239
But that spell bounced back.

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,719
We hugged because of the spell.

427
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,846
Why was it so strange?

428
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,187
It’s...

429
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,559
The misunderstanding has been resolved!

430
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,852
It’s a good thing!

431
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,519
But Xuan Ji, do you
have any symptoms?

432
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,279
- Are you feeling not well?
- No.

433
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,159
I’m fine without that blue light.

434
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,719
I didn’t want to make you worried.
That’s why I kept it from you all.

435
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,126
But now, I was
left with no choice.

436
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,039
Do you believe me now?

437
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,599
You tried to show off
even though you’re not skilled.

438
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,559
Also, why did you hide it from me?

439
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,159
Did you think I’d hurt Xuan Ji
or spread a rumour?

440
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,839
I was wrong, my dear.

441
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,279
I regret for making such a grave mistake.

442
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,139
Forgive me and I’ll do anything for you.

443
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,999
And I’d like to gift
this dagger to you.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,279
Look.

445
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,361
Your name is actually
engraved on it.

446
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,076
<i>LING LONG</i>

447
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,879
It’s all a misunderstanding.

448
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,919
I’ve always wanted to marry a lady.

449
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,359
- She is...
- Shut up!

450
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,119
I’m not accepting it.

451
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,658
I haven’t forgiven you for
causing such a big misunderstanding.

452
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,519
- Ling Long, don’t go!
- Ling Long!

453
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,199
- Isn’t the misunderstanding resolved?
- Ling Long!

454
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,159
Why are you still fighting, Ling Long?

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,809
Girl.

456
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,159
They’re not fighting.

457
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,119
That’s called flirting.

458
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,819
I’m jealous.

459
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:21,559
Although you usually seem confused,

460
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,519
you act decisively at crucial moments.

461
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,079
Not bad.

462
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,319
Thus, I think that impulsive
warrior isn’t suitable for you.

463
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,479
But it’s okay.

464
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,279
We have another model.

465
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,671
You’re suitable for a man who’s
gentle, determined, polite,

466
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:41,052
charismatic, and ambitious.

467
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,277
Brother Liu, what are you talking about?

468
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,479
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

469
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,399
The best fish has always been with you.

470
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,079
Turn around and you can see that
he’s always protected you!

471
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,359
Why has everyone left?
Some dishes aren’t served yet.

472
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,736
Ruo Yu.

473
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,314
Forget about what I just said.

474
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,312
- Brother Liu.
- I...

475
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,759
Why did the spell bounce back?

476
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,487
It’s all your doing, wasn’t it?

477
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,359
Master.

478
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,239
I thought Chu Xuan Ji liked Zhong Min Yan.

479
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,039
And I was worried about your mask.

480
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,359
I just wanted you to leave her soonest.

481
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,959
That’s why...

482
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,319
That’s why I...

483
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,239
It took you a lot of effort
to transform into a human.

484
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,565
You don’t focus on cultivating yourself.

485
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,519
And you can’t stop scheming.

486
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,740
It seems that you want to
turn back into a snake forever.

487
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,359
No. I admit it’s my fault.

488
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,096
Do you?

489
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,159
Remember.

490
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,905
If you ever do such a thing
again, I’ll teach you a good lesson.

491
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,999
Master, I’m okay if she can
break your Loveless Curse.

492
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,509
If she can’t, I
won’t let her go.

493
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,500
I was trying to matchmake for you.
Why did you run away?

494
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,670
Were you shy?

495
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,159
Let’s go, I’ll matchmake for you again.

496
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,439
Brother Liu.

497
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,599
Surely Xuan Ji feels troubled
about what just happened.

498
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,297
Let’s not make her feel more upset.

499
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,319
Little Phoenix.

500
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,745
You remain a gentleman
at this critical moment.

501
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,199
Xuan Ji is like a blank paper.

502
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,279
You’ll draw whatever you want.

503
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,599
Think about it.
Her sixth senior sent her a meal.

504
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,959
And she thought she liked him.

505
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,159
You have many chances to
make her surrender herself to you.

506
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,439
It depends on whether
you will seize the opportunity.

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,260
I’m anxious seeing you this way.

508
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,919
You and Xuan Ji are just two stiffs.

509
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,293
If it keeps going this way, you’ll
remain two stiffs after a hundred year.

510
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,679
Let’s do it this way.

511
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:40,799
You will walk to her
and be a fortune teller.

512
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,559
"Miss."

513
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,719
"According to your Five Elements,
you’re in need of a man."

514
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,759
"What do you think about me?"

515
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,290
This trick is not good enough.

516
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,759
Fine.

517
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,239
Let’s have a more straightforward one.

518
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,695
You’ll choose a moonless and windy night.

519
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,879
Brother Liu.

520
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,253
Just keep these
tricks for yourself.

521
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,946
Fine.

522
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,199
Little Phoenix.

523
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,580
Take it.

524
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,614
Don’t say I didn’t help you.

525
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,043
Thank you, Si Feng.

526
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:47,826
For the long walk.

527
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,159
Back when I was in
Shaoyang, I was really silly.

528
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,799
The seniors and juniors always bullied me.

529
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,679
But whenever I was upset,

530
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,879
only Ling Long and Sixth Senior
would cheer me up.

531
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,839
They’ve been fighting these past two days.

532
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,144
I’m actually worried about it.

533
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,119
I was truly silly back then.

534
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,119
I always imposed my feelings upon others.

535
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,062
Now that you understand it, that
means you’re not ridiculously silly.

536
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,719
Xuan Ji.

537
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,079
What’s wrong?

538
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,479
Xuan Ji.

539
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,903
Don’t cry.

540
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,531
Got you!

541
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,439
Did you forget that I can’t cry?

542
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,839
It’s the Merman’s Tear.

543
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,591
Why were you panicking?

544
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,439
I see.

545
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,058
You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?

546
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,199
It’s because when Second Senior
was rejected by Senior Duan Min,

547
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,759
he cried so hard.

548
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,759
His nose ran. And his tears kept falling.

549
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,159
That’s why I think
this is where I should cry.

550
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,839
But I can’t do it.

551
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,239
That’s why I pretended to cry.

552
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,799
I think your second senior
made that up to save his face.

553
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,879
Tears are a precious thing.

554
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,239
Even if you pretend to cry, you
can’t simply let your tears flow.

555
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,553
Get it?

556
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,079
I find that embarrassing too.

557
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,090
I really want to be like everyone else.

558
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:30,311
That’s why I made such a joke.

559
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,906
I need to stop being confused.

560
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,959
When I was young, my mother taught me

561
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,291
to write the names of
important people on a notebook.

562
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,803
Look.

563
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,047
<i>FATHER, MOTHER, SIXTH SENIOR, SISTER</i>

564
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,590
<i>SENIOR HAO CHEN, YU SI FENG</i>

565
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:13,289
You wrote

566
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,265
my name too.

567
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,559
Of course I did, Si Feng.

568
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,982
You’re very important.

569
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,559
But Brother Liu said that

570
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,026
it’s unique to like someone.
And it can’t be shared.

571
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:28,365
But I find all of these people important.

572
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,639
And I like them all.

573
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,140
Can’t I?

574
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:36,559
She sees no difference between
kinship, friendship, and relationship.

575
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,902
She really knows nothing about them.

576
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,279
Actually, there’s no need to
distinguish them from each other.

577
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,858
They’re all feelings which
come from one’s heart.

578
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:50,728
You’ll figure it out eventually.

579
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,711
But I don’t think I will.

580
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:01,379
You do know that I’m lack of six senses.

581
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,024
My heart can’t feel them.

582
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,294
That’s too bad.

583
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:12,647
I envy those who know
what they’re thinking.

584
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:14,839
They know what they want.

585
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,413
And there’s me who’s always confused.

586
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,559
Si Feng.

587
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,581
That fragment of Mirror of
Origin, do you still keep it?

588
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,679
Yes, I do.

589
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,028
Do you

590
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,921
want to keep looking for your six senses?

591
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,217
I...

592
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,119
I do.

593
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,745
I want to find out my thoughts.

594
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,439
But I’m scared.

595
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,879
I don’t wish to misunderstand others.

596
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,719
But

597
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,479
I promised Senior Hao Chen that
I’ll stop looking for the six senses.

598
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,504
Also, what if everyone else gets
hurt by my strange memory and power?

599
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,599
Si Feng.

600
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,820
What should I do?

601
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,719
If You don’t know your
heart, you can’t feel for others.

602
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,279
You won’t know how to protect them.

603
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,749
And you won’t know
how not to hurt them, right?

604
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,679
Your senior wants you
to do good and fight evil.

605
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,639
But it’s not easy to tell good from evil.

606
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,698
If you’re confused, you
can’t tell good from evil.

607
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,999
You said you’re scared
of that strange power.

608
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,639
But it’s when we’re in danger
that the power is unleashed.

609
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,639
I guess it’s not
some demon trick.

610
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,562
It’s your secret weapon.

611
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,149
Some proper guidance will
even turn it into your booster.

612
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:55,039
Besides, I’m with you.

613
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,613
No matter what
happens, I’ll protect you.

614
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,173
Si Feng.

615
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,839
Are you staying?

616
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,834
You’re not training
separately again, are you?

617
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:16,410
Didn’t you make
me eat the Truth Pill?

618
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,628
I’ve confided myself

619
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,039
to you.

620
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,896
I knew you wouldn’t leave us.

621
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,599
Xuan Ji.

622
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,220
Are you ready?

623
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,768
Xuan Ji. Xuan Ji!

624
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,531
Si Feng.

625
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,485
I...

626
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,199
I saw that general killing people again.

627
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,141
And this time it’s more lifelike.

628
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,937
But... But who is she?

629
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,319
Why is she always on my mind?

630
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,039
Don’t worry. A fragment
can’t prove anything.

631
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,921
When all the fragments are
found, we’ll know the truth.

632
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,197
There’s demonic aura.

633
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,423
Why can’t I feel it?

634
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,292
Si Feng.

635
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,472
Is this the smell of flowers?

636
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,277
Xuan Ji.

637
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,887
You’ve recovered your sense of smell.

638
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,230
This smells so nice.

639
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,839
There are many smells in this world.

640
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,039
Everything has its smell.

641
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,319
And there are many interesting ones.

642
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,672
Come with me.

643
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,915
- This is a peach blossom forest.
- It’s so beautiful!

644
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,239
Peach blossoms smell so nice!

645
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,228
No wonder... No wonder Ling
Long’s room is always full of flowers.

646
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,519
Si Feng.

647
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,123
Does each flower have its own smell?

648
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:17,919
Each of them smells different.

649
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,679
Sometimes its smell is
memorable than its appearance.

650
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,679
You can’t distinguish
their colours for now.

651
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,974
But you can differentiate them
based on their smells.

652
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,552
Si Feng, what do you smell like?

653
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,799
I smell like nothing.

654
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,599
No, you smell good.

655
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,559
But it doesn’t smell like
a flower or a food.

656
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,852
But

657
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,709
it’s a familiar smell.

658
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,679
Xuan Ji.

659
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,022
I

660
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:31,611
Would like you to
know that I... I...

661
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,079
Si Feng, there are too many flowers here.

662
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,169
My nose has gotten uncomfortable
from all this smell.

663
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,140
It’s very uncomfortable.

664
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,151
It’s okay.

665
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,279
We have plenty of time.

666
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,399
There will be chances to experience it.

667
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,347
- Let’s go there.
- Sure.

668
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,458
<i>KELAI TAVERN</i>

669
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,489
Take this.

670
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,599
Teach me how to cook tonight.

671
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,216
Sure.

672
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,759
Senior Hao Chen.

673
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,439
It’s been a while since
I last wrote my thoughts.

674
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,399
Because many things have happened lately.

675
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,079
But I’ve figured out several things.

676
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,479
I think Si Feng’s right.

677
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,879
One should know what he’s thinking.

678
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,193
And don’t be confused.

679
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,839
No way.

680
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,959
If I write that,

681
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,159
Senior Hao Chen will know that
I’m still looking for the mirror.

682
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,144
I’d better not tell him.

683
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,459
Forget about it. Anyway, it’s no big deal.

684
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,372
Si Feng?

685
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,879
Are they edible?

686
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,873
What a sumptuous feast.

687
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,999
We can’t afford it.

688
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,607
What’s that good smell?

689
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,546
There are so many nice dishes here.

690
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,039
Why don’t you dig in?

691
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,540
We...

692
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,220
It’s delicious!

693
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,559
- Brother Liu will buy us this meal.
- Min Yan.

694
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,997
- He’ll pay for it. I want to eat it too.
- Ling Long.

695
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,799
Ruo Yu, join us.

696
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,140
You...

697
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,239
Does it taste good?

698
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,592
Does it taste delicious?

699
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,410
Why don’t you say something?
Does it taste good?
