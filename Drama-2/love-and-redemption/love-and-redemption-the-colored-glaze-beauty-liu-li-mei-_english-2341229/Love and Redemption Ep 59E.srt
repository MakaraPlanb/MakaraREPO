00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,279
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,550
<i>EPISODE 59</i>

3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,120
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,319
I will not let you ruin
the Transcendent Furnace.

5
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,399
Because I want to protect
my memories with Xuan Ji!

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,433
Si Feng.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,416
Then go to hell!

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,920
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

9
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,929
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

10
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,607
Si Feng!

11
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,879
Yu Si Feng. Look, Xuan Ji is back.

12
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,839
Are you worried?

13
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,073
I don’t want you to die.

14
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,068
Hearing these words,

15
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
I can die

16
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,935
with no regrets.

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,630
Actually...

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,467
Actually,

19
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,077
I bet with Bailing.

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,161
That

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,755
you’re not a murderous demon.

22
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,685
Because

23
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,086
your heart has gained flesh and blood.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,600
This heart wouldn’t bring itself
to destroy the three realms.

25
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,258
Because

26
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,875
I warmed it, little by little.

27
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,719
Si Feng!

28
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,168
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,519
I’ll save you.

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,757
I will save you.

31
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,399
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

32
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,559
Si Feng!

33
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,973
Si Feng.

34
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,746
It won’t do any good.

35
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,878
My heart

36
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,160
has been pierced.

37
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,217
But it’s good.

38
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,620
I won back your heart with mine.

39
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,393
It’s worth it.

40
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,479
Please look after the three realms.

41
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,206
Because there are

42
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,600
where our many memories are.

43
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,076
As long as the three realms exist,

44
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,948
they will never disappear.

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,412
Xuan Ji.

46
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,618
Do you hear me?

47
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,865
Remember.

48
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,733
I’ve had

49
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,160
ten happy lives.

50
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,838
Because no matter what,

51
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,316
I could meet you.

52
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:27,484
And it’s

53
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,693
good enough.

54
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,399
Si Feng.

55
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,577
Si Feng.

56
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,473
Si Feng!

57
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:35,879
Si Feng!

58
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,479
Si Feng!

59
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,039
Si Feng!

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,399
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

61
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,599
Si Feng!

62
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,771
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji.

63
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,439
Si Feng!

64
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,719
Si Feng, it’s me Xuan Ji!

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,079
I’m back, Si Feng!

66
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,649
Si Feng!

67
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,957
Si Feng!

68
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,517
Yuan Lang.

69
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,559
You killed my
mother and Si Feng!

70
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,261
I’m going to kill you today!

71
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,954
I want to be the ruler of three realms!

72
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:34,119
No one can stop me!

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,390
No one can stop me!

74
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,006
No one can stop me!

75
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,959
Ruo Yu!

76
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,851
You took everything from me!

77
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:54,399
You locked up my family,
killed my loved one,

78
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,649
and forced me to kill my brother!

79
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,599
- Ruo Yu.
- Ruo Yu.

80
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,457
Don’t you ever harm
the three realms again!

81
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,405
I’ve been waiting for
the three realms to ruin.

82
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,815
I’ve waited for one thousand years!

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,679
I must succeed.

84
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,834
I must succeed!

85
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,841
- Ruo Yu!
- Ruo Yu!

86
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,683
Oh no!

87
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,839
I am the ruler of three realms!

88
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,914
The ruler of three realms!

89
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,599
Jade Emperor, help me!

90
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,296
I want to keep these three realms forever!

91
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
Is this your final decision?

92
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,135
This is me and Si Feng’s final decision.
I don’t want the three realms to go!

93
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:22,542
Fine, let me give you a hand.

94
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:06,917
Si Feng.

95
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,519
Si Feng.

96
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,079
Look.

97
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,439
I didn’t lose the three realms.

98
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,109
Didn’t you ask me to keep our memories?

99
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,000
I did it.

100
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,959
Look what I’ve done.

101
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:30,732
Please.

102
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:42,559
Bailing.

103
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,519
Xi Xuan bet with you.

104
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,359
That Rahu Ketu isn’t
some apocalyptic demon.

105
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,654
What do you think?

106
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:02,915
Jade Emperor.

107
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,587
I lost.

108
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,904
My deeply improper thoughts

109
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,051
have ruined the three realms

110
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,159
and killed many lives.

111
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,193
And I’ve ruined Rahu Ketu
and hurt my own self.

112
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,252
I am unpardonable.

113
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,166
King Bailing.

114
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,599
I am the root of this
thousand-year grudge.

115
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,500
I feel too ashamed to live.

116
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,488
Chu Xuan Ji.

117
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,399
Please grant my death.

118
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,164
Let me free.

119
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
I will never simply take one’s life

120
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,299
for my own interest.

121
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,202
Even if he’s

122
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,647
as wicked as you.

123
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,593
Si Feng once said that

124
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,880
revenge is an endless cycle.

125
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,492
In this life,

126
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,765
my heart

127
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,085
has found the more important thing.

128
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,192
There’s no more room for the hatred.

129
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,429
From now on,

130
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,240
we have nothing to do with each other.

131
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
This...

132
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,288
Rahu Ketu?

133
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,636
Brother Rahu.

134
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,887
Chu Xuan Ji.

135
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,759
You’ve had a lucky life than me.

136
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
You’ve met those whom you care about.

137
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,759
And they’re willing to sacrifice for you.

138
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,119
You must cherish them.

139
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,834
I really wish that
I could live once again.

140
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:13,991
Bailing.

141
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,846
Do you still remember

142
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,602
the bank of Ruoshui River?

143
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
The bank of Ruoshui River.

144
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,887
In the Baiyu Pavilion.

145
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,817
It’s where we drank.

146
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,465
Those days,

147
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,084
I always remember them.

148
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,647
Yes.

149
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,295
I always remember them too.

150
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,554
We had our last drink
one thousand years ago.

151
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,493
You toasted me, and I drank mine.

152
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:57,043
I toasted you, but
you didn’t drink yours.

153
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,721
Today,

154
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,968
you shall drink it.

155
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,011
Sure.

156
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,488
Brother Rahu.

157
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,147
I shall drink it.

158
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:23,944
- King Bailing!
- King Bailing!

159
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:30,928
King Bailing.

160
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:35,825
We have finally done drinking.

161
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,812
King Bailing.

162
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,759
- King Bailing!
- King Bailing!

163
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,327
Don’t come over.

164
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:47,454
I brought this all upon myself.

165
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:53,321
Rahu Ketu resents someone
and does not forgive me.

166
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:57,327
In fact, I cannot even forgive myself.

167
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:00,495
I just want to bring you to justice

168
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:04,096
for what you did to me and other victims.

169
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,088
You brought this to yourself.

170
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,684
It serves you right.

171
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:12,439
Vanity is all I’ve cultivated
these ten thousand years.

172
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,836
Now that it’s come to this,

173
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,154
wouldn’t it be a death worth dying?

174
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:19,241
King Bailing.

175
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,943
Don’t follow in my footsteps.

176
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,724
My obsession with grievance and scheming

177
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,098
eventually led to my big mistake.

178
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,974
Jade Emperor.

179
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,159
I know that I don’t deserve to be a deity.

180
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,679
Today, I’m entering the channel
of karma and recultivating myself.

181
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,511
If there were to be the chance
ten thousand years from now,

182
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:45,561
I would be sitting by your side

183
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,562
and listening to
your teachings, Jade Emperor.

184
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,446
Bailing,

185
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,678
God willing, may you repent
and be enlightened soonest.

186
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,051
King Bailing!

187
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,037
King Bailing!

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
King Bailing!

189
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,106
Listen my fellow deities.

190
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,599
The death of Bailing

191
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,000
is the merit he has earned
by repenting and taking his own life.

192
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,919
The heavens has
done the Demon Citadel wrong.

193
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,359
You shall not kill and
taking revenge on the demons.

194
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,639
From today onward,

195
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,759
the three realms are equal and
shall live in harmony with one another.

196
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,203
Anyone disobeying this
order will be severely punished.

197
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,604
We shall obey the decree, Jade Emperor!

198
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,959
Jade Emperor.

199
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,279
Si Feng died saving the three realms.

200
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,743
It’s not his fault. The fault is all mine!

201
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,098
I beg you.

202
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,343
Please save him.

203
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:29,806
I’m willing to exchange my life for his!

204
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,799
Xi Xuan is my son.
I certainly hope that he’ll be fine.

205
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,279
But I have no control over life and death.

206
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,694
As much as I want to save him,
there’s nothing I can do.

207
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,328
However...

208
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,834
What?

209
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:48,159
However, I need not do so anymore.

210
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,969
Someone’s saved him.

211
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,262
What is this?

212
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:02,639
It’s Rahu Ketu’s heart.

213
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,839
When Rahu Ketu brushed Xi Yuan’s chest,

214
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,618
he’s planted half of
the Jade Heart in him.

215
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,856
The heart has gained flesh and blood.

216
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,319
It can save his life.

217
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,254
Will this heart start beating again
and wake him up?

218
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:32,180
That depends on you.

219
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,999
Thank you for your guidance, Jade Emperor.

220
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,967
Si Feng will surely wake up.

221
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,014
He will wake up for sure.

222
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,018
He will surely wake up.

223
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,439
Jade Emperor, please tell me
where my daughter is.

224
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,833
I’m the one who stole the celestial eye.
She has nothing to do with it.

225
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,479
Please have mercy on us, Jade Emperor!

226
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,633
You stole the celestial eye
because of your daughter.

227
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,958
It is a father’s love to his child.

228
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,239
And you went to Kunlun to see me
for the sake of three realms.

229
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,679
You have made up for the mistake.

230
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,639
You should head back to Qingyang.

231
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,764
Your father-daughter relationship
is not over yet.

232
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,599
She is waiting for you at home.

233
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,679
Sure!

234
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,832
I’m leaving now!
Thank you, Jade Emperor!

235
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,554
Jade Emperor, what about Purple Fox?

236
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,439
I took them to the Mount Kunlun,
and I’ve made up for the mistake!

237
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,879
Please save Purple Fox too!

238
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,759
Purple Fox died for you, and bears
your sins from thousand years ago.

239
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,792
What goes around comes around.
She will re-enter the channel of karma.

240
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:37,439
Then where is she?

241
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,805
She has suffered from missing you
for a thousand years.

242
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,239
Why should you go and see her?

243
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,879
Twelve hours from now, she is
going to drink the Water of Forgetting.

244
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,759
- Water of Forgetting?
- She will forget you in the next life.

245
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,079
And she will be free.

246
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,720
Little Fox is at the River of Forgetting?

247
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,947
Deep yet transient love.

248
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,411
Why bother?

249
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:06,136
Xuan Ji, let’s go home.

250
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,599
Flying Snake.

251
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,200
I know that you had
a deep affection for King Bailing.

252
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,585
You may stay here as long as you want.

253
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,800
You have my word forever.

254
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:27,408
You may go far away
for as long as you want.

255
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,885
You’re welcome to
come back anytime.

256
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,935
Take good care of yourself.

257
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,550
Si Feng,

258
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,345
let’s go home now.

259
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,239
Wu Zhi Qi.

260
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,039
He’s the most easy-going and
carefree person in the world.

261
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,199
Little Fox.

262
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,919
- Wu Zhi Qi!
- Thank you.

263
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,275
For saving me.

264
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,137
I’m willing to do anything

265
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,412
to save Wu Zhi Qi.

266
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,090
Don’t let me go again.

267
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,284
Little Fox!

268
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:03,582
Wu Zhi Qi.

269
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:14,649
Little Fox.

270
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,963
I will never let you go again.

271
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,035
Candied Chinese hawthorn!

272
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:20,592
Yu’Er.

273
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,399
Old Fogey, where’ve you been?

274
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,719
You’ve been away too long!
I’m starving!

275
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,906
Cook for me!

276
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,384
Sure!

277
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,461
I’m going home to cook for you now.

278
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,420
Gosh, you’re a grown-up.

279
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,148
Don’t cry, it’s so embarrassing.

280
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,199
Oh right, I want to eat scallion pancake.
Buy me some.

281
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,519
Sure.

282
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,551
I’m willing to buy you
scallion pancake for life.

283
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,075
Let’s go.

284
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,239
Old Fogey, I’m telling you.

285
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,919
There are many delicious foods ahead.

286
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,724
Ahead there. Let’s go.

287
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:36,478
Si Feng,

288
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,887
we’re home.

289
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,365
But

290
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:47,373
when will you wake up?

291
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,572
It’s okay.

292
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,869
No matter how long,

293
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,352
I’ll always wait for you.

294
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,359
Si Feng. Did you know?

295
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,639
Ling Long and Sixth Senior

296
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,629
are fighting about
who the baby will look like.

297
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:13,313
Sixth Senior says Ling Long’s too short.

298
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,679
Ling Long says Sixth Senior’s too dull.

299
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,639
I was there when she
chased after and hit him.

300
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,042
Isn’t it funny?

301
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,715
And look at this.

302
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,620
It’s your favorite Qingyang lotus seeds.

303
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:32,770
Si Feng.

304
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,959
Do you still remember the promise
we made under the Magpie Bridge?

305
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,990
That we’ll be together forever.

306
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,649
Si Feng.

307
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:12,895
You must’ve had a hard
time practicing sword moves.

308
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,099
You’ve been sleeping for so long.

309
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:21,455
But the calluses on your hands
haven’t gone away.

310
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,035
I received a letter from
Brother Liu today.

311
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,279
He says Yu’Er isn’t as obedient as you.

312
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,440
She competes with him all the time.

313
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,000
Si Feng.

314
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,959
Si Feng!

315
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,066
Si Feng!

316
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,284
Si Feng!

317
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,759
Si Feng!

318
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,920
Si Feng!

319
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:17,261
Si Feng!

320
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,328
Si Feng!

321
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,879
Si Feng!

322
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,046
Si Feng!

323
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,451
Si Feng!

324
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:27,914
Si Feng!

325
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,539
Si Feng!

326
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,919
Si Feng!

327
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
Xuan Ji.

328
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,882
Xuan Ji.

329
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,963
Si Feng.

330
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,636
I’ve missed you so much.

331
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,726
I’ve really missed you so much.

332
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,320
Xuan Ji.

333
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,000
Don’t cry.

334
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,863
I’m not crying.

335
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,401
I’m happy.

336
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:38,683
The tears fell down themselves.

337
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,240
Silly girl.

338
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,999
I knew you’d come back, Si Feng.

339
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,119
I knew you’d surely come back.

340
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Silly girl.

341
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:55,336
How would I not come back
when you’re here?

342
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,471
Let’s go.

343
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,439
Where to?

344
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,082
Go ask my father for my hand.

345
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:18,630
Father!

346
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,159
Si Feng? You...

347
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,439
Sect Leader Chu,

348
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,818
I have fully recovered.

349
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,004
That’s great.

350
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,879
Si Feng.

351
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,919
Because of my foolishness,
you’ve had gone through a lot.

352
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,329
- This time I...
- I am alright now.

353
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,504
Father, please allow me to marry Si Feng.

354
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:45,995
Sure.

355
00:31:46,951 --> 00:31:48,170
Sure!

356
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,519
Xuan Ji?

357
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,849
- Ling Long?
- Get in first.

358
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,199
It’s your wedding day.

359
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,079
You should wait for Si Feng in there.
Why are you lingering out here?

360
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,074
Auntie Ying Hong
has dressed me up long ago.

361
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,428
I felt so bored staying in the room.

362
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:30,199
Moreover, our sect
doesn’t care about formality.

363
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,839
That’s why I decided to come
and check the guests out.

364
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,079
You are, as always, inappropriate.
Go back and stay in there.

365
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,088
I’ll decorate the venue well.

366
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,359
Xuan Ji.

367
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,559
A kid at the foot of the mountain
helped someone to sent you this gift.

368
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,000
He didn’t mention who the sender is.

369
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,720
<i>[May you have a blessed marriage.
I am pleased for you.]</i>

370
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,774
It’s Merman’s Tear.

It’s from Ting Nu.

372
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,283
But why didn’t he send it himself?

373
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,363
He asked someone else to do so instead.

374
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,599
They’re here!

375
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,239

Both of you must get along well.

Rest assured, Father-in-law.

00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:32,835

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,203
Shouldn’t...

406
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,534
Shouldn’t we blow out the candles first?

407
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,400
I’ve been waiting for this day to come.

408
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,120
There’s no way
I’m blowing out the candles.

This is such a wonderful moment.

Why are you in a trance?

416
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:38,094
I remember my mother once told me this.

You’re pregnant.
How can you hang the couplet?

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,759

No, why...

Why do you get mad all the time?

- Lord Dong Fang, have fun.
- Oh no, Brother Chu’s drunk.

00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,879
Hurry up and give me the hangover cure.

I’ve caught you red-handed.

- I can’t hold my liquor.
- You used to tricked me with this cure.

475

- I can’t drink.
- This time I’m going to punish you.

- Let me pour it for you.
- No!

Brother Liu, you’re late.

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,799
- We’ve been waiting for you.
- It’s all Yu’Er’s fault.

485
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,999
- Here.
- She kept asking for food and drink.

486
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,079
- That’s why we’re late.
- It’s because you’re stingy.

487
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,439
- Have a seat first.
- You always bought so little.

488
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
- Of course I needed to buy more.
- She’s blaming me.

489
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,674
You can eat as much as
you want today, have a seat.

490
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,279

- Baby.
- Flying Snake?

493
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,039
Don’t cry, baby. There, there.

494
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,199
I heard there’s good food.
Of course I’ve got to be here.

495
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,428
Ask them to serve the food.

496
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:48,953
Want to eat those delicious food?
Here, help me to carry him first.

497
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:50,279
Don’t cry.

498
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,740
Don’t cry.

499
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:53,679
- Don’t cry.
- He peed.

500
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,290
Carry him!

501
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,079
Careful, the baby!

502
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,639
Yu’Er...

503
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,244
Yu’Er used to pee a lot when she’s small.
You’ll get used to it eventually.

504
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,639
- It’s okay. Here, let me do it.
- Brother Chu, you should stop drinking.

505
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,041
- We’ve just started, fill up the cut.
- Don’t drop the baby!

506
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,359
One thousand years ago,
you’re a created existence.

507
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,599
That’s why every step you took
wasn’t determined by fate.

508
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,959
You’re all on your own.

509
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,999
It’s up to you to be a demon,
an immortal, or a mortal.

510
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,999
I’d like to ask you this.

511
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,833
What does it feel to be a mortal?

512
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,881
It’s good to be a mortal.
