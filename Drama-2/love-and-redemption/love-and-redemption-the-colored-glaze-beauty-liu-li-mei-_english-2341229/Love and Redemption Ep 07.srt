00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,850
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 7</i>

3
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
So, the lady you like is called Xuan Ji.

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
Brother Liu.

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,485
You eavesdropped on me.

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,470
If I didn’t do that, how would I
know that you’ll be so lovesick.

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,038
You can’t even save yourself.

8
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,724
And you are still thinking about
your lover?

9
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,599
But does your lover know that you are

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,831
being punished here because of her?

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,628
Of course she knows.

12
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,159
We made a deal.

13
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,589
We are going to roam the world
and train together.

14
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,441
We still have a long way ahead of us.

15
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:11,999
The future?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,886
Are you that confident that
you can survive the 13 Punishments?

17
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:15,898
Of course.

18
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:19,981
I still have a lot of things
that I haven’t do yet.

19
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:21,536
I promised Xuan Ji that

20
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,861
I’m going to find
the Mirror of Origin for her.

21
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:27,062
I will not let myself die
in that 13 Punishments.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,753
Mirror of Origin?

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Isn’t that the magical mirror where
you can see your previous life?

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,040
Brother Liu, you know about it too?

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,399
It’s used to be a mythological object
from the heavenly realm.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,697
But it’s broken and
scattered across the world, right?

27
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,427
Yes. I’m going to collect
all of the pieces.

28
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,371
Collect all of the pieces?

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,888
Little Phoenix.

30
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:02,821
If I tell you that I’ve seen a
piece of the Mirror of Origin before,

31
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,919
how are you going to repay me?

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,199
Brother Liu, where did you see it?

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,336
When I was digging the secret tunnel,

34
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:14,079
I was climbing on top of the Kushui River.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
Suddenly, a ray of bright light
shone into my eyes.

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,126
So dazzlingly bright.

37
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,838
When I paused to look at it,
a saw a mirror shard

38
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,679
lying on top of the riverbed
of Kushui River.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,776
It’s the same shard that I saw in
the Ancient Record of Magical Objects.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,233
Brother Liu, how can I
get into the Kushui River then?

41
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:36,238
Tell me.

42
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:42,417
Little Phoenix. Actually,
I just saw it from afar that day.

43
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,468
I’m not sure whether it’s
the shard of the Mirror of Origin.

44
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,766
No need to make yourself suffer.

45
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,435
I promised Xuan Ji.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,700
The water of Kushui River
is not normal water.

47
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,110
You’ll feel like you’ve been burnt
just by touching it.

48
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,429
Besides, the deeper you go,
the more painful it is.

49
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,304
You can’t bear with
that kind of bone-deep pain.

50
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,598
I can.

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,237
Xuan Ji.

52
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:08,879
Why did you agree to go to Xuyang Peak?

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,830
After you leave, we won’t
be able to be like this again.

54
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,466
If you are bullied,

55
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,250
I won’t be able to protect you anymore.
Do you know that?

56
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:20,646
Ling Long, I’m going there
to become stronger.

57
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:24,013
Look. Our father is
the sect leader of Shaoyang Sect.

58
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,079
He’s so powerful.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,674
But he has me, his useless daughter.

60
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:35,359
Moreover, I’ve embarrassed him
so much during the Flower Session.

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,999
Who said that you embarrassed him?
I’ll give him a piece of mind!

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,641
Ling Long, this is not what I meant.

63
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:43,548
Look. You are so smart.
Everyone likes you.

64
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,093
But I always drag others down
and bring troubles to everyone.

65
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,479
Even I, am sick of myself.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,519
Besides, I’m going to
Xuyang Peak to train this time.

67
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,959
After I finish my training,
I can protect myself.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,650
I might even be able to protect you.

69
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,331
So, don’t worry about me anymore, okay?

70
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,109
Xuan Ji, if you want to learn,

71
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,212
I can teach you.
You can learn slowly from me.

72
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:08,999
Can you don’t go to Xuyang Peak?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,319
Ling Long, don’t be like this.

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,442
Why are you acting like a child?

75
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,738
It’s not that I’m not coming back.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,658
Okay now.

77
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,412
Little Phoenix, how are you feeling?

78
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:30,097
Don’t act tough. Just come up
if you can’t take it anymore.

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,371
Dummy.

80
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,649
Okay then.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,599
If they bully you over
there, you have to tell me.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,149
Then, I’ll tell father and ask him
to bring you back, okay?

83
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:54,323
Okay, I’ll definitely tell you
if that happens.

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,790
Unfortunately, Si Feng is not here.

85
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,919
I really want to tell him about me
going to Xuyang Peak.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,439
Si Feng?

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,541
Oh, right.

88
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,085
I almost forgot again.
Si Feng asked me to give you this.

89
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,677
You can use it to send
your voice across the world.

90
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,758
You just need to activate it
like you activate a spell.

91
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,626
Si Feng.

92
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,207
Little Phoenix, have you found it?

93
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,496
If you can’t find it, give up! Come up!

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,199
Si Feng. I am Xuan Ji.

95
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,119
I want to tell you that
I’ve recovered now.

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,253
What about you?
Have you gone back to Lize Palace?

97
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,070
How is everything at Lize Palace?

98
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:08,343
Did I use it the wrong way?

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,867
Maybe the bell is not with Si Feng now.

100
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,119
Try it later.

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,323
Okay.

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,919
Ling Long, actually, I quite miss Si Feng.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,737
I’ve decided.
After I come back from Xuyang Peak,

104
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,230
we’ll fly there with our swords
to see him.

105
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,999
And then, we’ll roam
the world together, okay?

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,341
Good idea.

107
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:32,358
I think it’ll take you 800 years until
you can fly with your sword.

108
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,279
Little Six is so bad.
Let’s ignore him, Xuan Ji.

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,799
Ling Long, I think
Sixth Senior is quite nice.

110
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,799
Xuan Ji, you are leaving tomorrow.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,861
I brought a jar of good wine
for you as farewell.

112
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,951
We’ll drink until we drop today.

113
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,097
So, this is the Mirror of Origin.

114
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,256
Brother Liu, thank you.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,199
Why are you thanking me?

116
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,000
You are the one who picked it up
without a care for your life.

117
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:07,054
The bitter water in Kushui
River is really dangerous.

118
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,355
It’s done.

119
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:13,972
I’ll tell Xuan Ji
about this at once.

120
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,494
Xuan Ji.

121
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,559
Xuan Ji.

122
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,652
Xuan Ji.

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,493
Xuan Ji.

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,840
Xuan Ji.

125
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,535
Xuan Ji.

126
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,345
Xuan Ji.

127
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:44,332
Xuan Ji.

128
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,101
Xuan Ji!

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,119
You put it so much effort
to help her find the shard.

130
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,788
But she doesn’t even reply you.

131
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,283
- Xuan Ji.
- Give it back.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,999
Maybe this bell is broken.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,039
But I heard it very clearly just now.

134
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,590
She has already woken up
but she still hasn’t contacted you yet.

135
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:10,080
I think she has already
forgotten about you.

136
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,702
You dummy.

137
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,799
There are so many
pretty ladies in the world.

138
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,159
Why do you have to like
a lady without six senses?

139
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,999
I think you must have grown dumb
because you stay too long in Lize Palace.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,848
I think you better escape from
the secret tunnel now.

141
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,134
Leave Lize Palace and never come back.

142
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:34,731
Don’t risk your life
for the 13 Punishments too.

143
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,959
Now, I’m even more curious
about this Miss Xuan Ji.

144
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,719
I want to take a good look at her
if I have the chance.

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,978
I want to see why you are
so obsessed with her.

146
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:58,539
You should learn from me.

147
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,261
When I was young,
I was charismatic and unrestrained.

148
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:04,531
I never stick to just one.

149
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:07,830
I like this one today and
I like that one tomorrow.

150
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,191
How awesome it was.

151
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:11,197
I want to ask you.

152
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,480
Do you feel the same way towards Yu’Er

153
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,855
and her mother?

154
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,367
When Yu’Er’s mother

155
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,709
was still young, she was
the most beautiful lady at

156
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,441
Yanhong Pavilion in Qingyang City.

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,998
Everyone was willing to spend thousands
just to get into her good book.

158
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,519
But she had only eyes for me.

159
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,851
After I came back to the palace,

160
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,668
she found out that she is pregnant.

161
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,245
And she gave birth to Yu’Er
without my knowledge.

162
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:57,390
She even carried Yu’Er and
travelled all the way to Lize Palace.

163
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,467
This woman was really brave.

164
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,439
Brother Liu.

165
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,227
But I’ve never heard you
mentioned about it before.

166
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,869
Just a state and boring past.

167
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,030
That time, I wanted to
live as a human for once

168
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:29,886
in seclusion with Yu’Er
and her mother in the forest.

169
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,992
But I never thought that

170
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,759
the old palace lord would
find out about it.

171
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,206
And after that,

172
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,062
Hong Yu was driven away.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,676
Lize Palace is always like this.

174
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,214
It’s inhumane.

175
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:58,018
At first, the old palace lord
want to capture Yu’Er too.

176
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,654
But I was holding his dark secret.

177
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,975
I was ready to go down with him.

178
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,719
And you know what happened next.

179
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,372
I made a vow

180
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:21,439
to stay in Lize Palace forever
to receive my punishment

181
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,176
in exchange for my daughter’s life.

182
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
But luckily, I wasn’t thrown into
the 13 Punishments Lianyu Pagoda.

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,519
Or else, I would be long dead.

184
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,811
I see. So,

185
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:39,342
you entrusted Yu’Er to a family of farmers
near Lize Palace

186
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,223
but don’t dare to meet up with her.

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,843
At least Yu’Er

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,861
can live in peace.

189
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:49,262
When I’m free,

190
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,277
I can sneak out to watch her.

191
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,341
This is quite nice.

192
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,978
It’s quite nice.

193
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,367
Time to eat.

194
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,520
Life is hard and short. Food and drinks
are the most important thing.

195
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,148
Where did you get this money bag?

196
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,559
I’m the one who gave this to
my daughter during her birthday this year.

197
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,588
Stop talking nonsense.
You can’t even get out from here.

198
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,180
How can you give present
to your illegitimate daughter?

199
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,306
You have a tongue.

200
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:38,286
If you don’t know how to speak,
I’ll pull it out for you.

201
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,839
Tell me. Where did you get this money bag?

202
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,205
I’ll tell you. Just now, a crying
old man came to Lize Palace.

203
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,039
I was passing by. So,
he gave me this money bag and

204
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,395
asked me to give you a letter.

205
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,172
You daughter was criticised for being
an illegitimate child with no parents.

206
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:55,441
So, she got furious and fought with them.

207
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,424
In the end,
she fell down the cliff and she is dying.

208
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,559
How can you only say that now?

209
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,479
- What can you do? You can’t go out.
- You!

210
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,582
Brother Liu, calm down.

211
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,053
Get lost!

212
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,599
Yu’Er is in trouble. No.

213
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,139
I have to save her.

214
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,559
Brother Liu, leave first. I’ll stop them.

215
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,719
- Little Phoenix, you...
- Say no more. Save your daughter first.

216
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,808
- Go now!
- Be careful then!

217
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:45,239
You lost the mask and fell in love.

218
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,358
We haven’t even
trialled you for those yet.

219
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:50,238
And now, you helped the criminal,
Liu Yi Huan, to escape.

220
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,518
This first pupil of Lize Palace
is really awesome.

221
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,325
How dare you!

222
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,726
I know that I’ve broken the rules.

223
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,573
I’m willing to be punished.

224
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:03,479
But I don’t think that I’m wrong.

225
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,402
Feelings and desires are the
most normal things in this world.

226
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,204
I don’t know why Lize
Palace will have so many rules

227
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:15,269
that make us live like a living corpse.

228
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,727
Insolent fool!

229
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,199
You repeatedly committed the same mistake.

230
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,589
Do you still have respect for
Lize Palace’s rules?

231
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,550
You impenitence creature.

232
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,679
How dare you question
the rules of our great ancestors.

233
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,717
Looks like you’ve made up your mind
to stand against Lize Palace.

234
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,022
Palace Lord.

235
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,777
Are you still going to
defend him this time?

236
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,911
Palace Lord, Yu Si Feng has broken
the major rules of the palace on repeat.

237
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,703
He even rebels against us.

238
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,789
As the discipline elder of
Lize Palace, please

239
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,990
send this disciple to 13 Punishments
Lianyu Pagoda at once.

240
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,920
Please give your order!

241
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,594
Palace Lord.

242
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,555
Time to give your order.

243
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,612
Palace Lord.

244
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,889
Do you still remember this?

245
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,231
This is the Black Feather Medallion
given by the old palace lord.

246
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,479
I can use it to keep palace lord in line
when the situation calls for it.

247
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,767
Since you are quite biased
towards Yu Si Feng,

248
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,751
I have no choice but to use this.

249
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,003
Stop forcing my master.

250
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,318
I’m willing to be punished.

251
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,316
Si Feng!

252
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,491
Si Feng!

253
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,816
You are willing to be punished.

254
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,859
Good.

255
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,559
From today onwards,

256
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,393
Yu Si Feng is no longer
the first pupil of Lize Palace.

257
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:25,054
From now on, those who broke the rules
will not be pardoned easily.

258
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,694
The same applies to even the best of us.

259
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,101
Guards.

260
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:37,862
Bring Yu Si Feng into
the 13 Punishments Lianyu Pagoda.

261
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,125
Get lost!

262
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,926
All of you, go away!

263
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,015
Xuan Ji.

264
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:54,557
When you reach Xuyang Peak,

265
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,074
remember to listen to
your master and your senior.

266
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,447
Train well.

267
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:06,937
Father.

268
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,349
Sister.

269
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,267
Sixth Senior. I’ll be leaving now.

270
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,696
Take care of yourself.

271
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,799
Xuan Ji, I can’t bear to part with you.

272
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,877
Me too.

273
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,557
Don’t worry. Xuyang Peak will
take good care of Junior Xuan Ji.

274
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,578
Thank you, Senior Hao Chen.

275
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:35,064
Xuan Ji, let’s go.

276
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,937
Xuan Ji.

277
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,976
Take care.

278
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,882
Take care.

279
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,170
Goodbye.

280
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,611
<i>PALACE HALL</i>

281
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,439
Xuan Ji.

282
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,279
Hao Chen said that you
are innocent and fearless.

283
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,550
I think he is right.

284
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,559
At first, I didn’t plan to accept
any more disciples

285
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,466
because I already have Hao Chen
to take over my place one day.

286
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,649
But he kept on recommending you to me

287
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,610
so that I can accept you as my disciple.

288
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:44,465
After giving it a thought, I think
that you are indeed a nice kid.

289
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,222
Senior.

290
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,492
Didn’t you say that he chose me?

291
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,441
Quickly kneel and greet your master.

292
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:04,422
Master, thank you for
accepting me as your disciple.

293
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:14,188
Good. From today onwards,
you are Xuyang Peak’s disciple.

294
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,725
From now on, you have to train hard

295
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,359
and bear the responsibility
to guard Xuyang Peak.

296
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,285
Yes, Master.

297
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,599
Get up.

298
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,159
Hao Chen.

299
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,484
After reinforcing the barrier of
the secret ground,

300
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,783
it’s quite stable now.

301
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,805
I’ve decided to meditate in seclusion

302
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:40,481
to fully understand the essence of
Heartless Tactics.

303
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:43,799
I just became his disciple
and he’s already going into seclusion?

304
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,821
When I’m not here, all the
disciples and matters of Xuyang Peak

305
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,302
will be under your care and jurisdiction.

306
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Are you clear?

307
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,040
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

308
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,399
Xuan Ji, I’ve
already passed down

309
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,679
everything I know to Hao Chen,
your senior.

310
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,217
I feel rest assured
for him to train you.

311
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,919
Follow his teachings and
respect him like he’s your master.

312
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,436
Don’t slack off.

313
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,543
Yes, Master.

314
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,389
Don’t worry, Master.

315
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,106
I’ll do my best to train and teach her.

316
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,749
Senior, what is the Heartless Tactics that

317
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,639
master said just now?
Is it something powerful?

318
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,748
That’s the ultimate skill of Xuyang Peak.

319
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:42,877
The people who practise it should
get rid of all emotions and distractions

320
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,998
to reach the state of Anatta, non-self.

321
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:48,101
This is the cultivation of Xuyang Peak
since the ancient times.

322
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,199
The ultimate skill?

323
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,516
I won’t be able to learn that.
It has nothing to do with me.

324
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,565
You are thinking that this skill
has nothing to do with you.

325
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,793
Right?

326
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,013
How do you know about that?

327
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:06,214
Your face is an open book.

328
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:10,319
It’s quite difficult for normal
people to reach that state.

329
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,173
But your six senses are undeveloped.
Your state of mind is different.

330
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:16,061
You are born to learn this
Heartless Tactics of Xuyang Peak

331
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,731
to become its protector.

332
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,279
Senior.

333
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,038
What is a protector?

334
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,076
This is what I want to tell you.

335
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:48,640
Protector is the duty of all
disciples of Xuyang Peak.

336
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,636
You accidentally went into
the secret ground,

337
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,279
you should know that there’s
a powerful celestial force inside.

338
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,470
If an evil man succeeds to break into it,
the world will be in chaos.

339
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,279
The duty of the protector is to protect
the secret ground with their lives.

340
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,015
Since you managed to come out
from the secret ground unharmed,

341
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,493
maybe this is your destiny
with the secret ground.

342
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:10,933
What’s inside the secret ground?

343
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:13,856
It’s not something that
young disciples should ask.

344
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:17,309
Just remember your duty and mission.

345
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,658
Train hard.

346
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,033
If you manage to reach
the state of immortality in the future,

347
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:24,438
your life will not be in vain.

348
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:28,439
Senior, I still have a question.

349
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,493
Why does human need to become a deity?

350
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,632
Isn’t it nice to be a normal human?

351
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Why do you have so many questions?

352
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,789
No matter it’s human, monsters or demons,

353
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,758
all of them wants to become deities.

354
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,966
Become a deity is the ultimate
and the only true path in life.

355
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,156
You just need to remember this.

356
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,809
By the way, I’ve already put
all of your things inside the library.

357
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,999
What things?

358
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,560
Your dagger, bell and kaleidoscope.

359
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,159
No. They are all gifts from others.

360
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,042
And they are my most precious things.

361
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,478
Xuan Ji, I just told you that

362
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,684
Xuyang Peak is all about reaching Anatta.

363
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:17,485
These things carry the feelings of others.

364
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:19,868
They’ll disturb you from your training.
Distractions.

365
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:22,592
So, you can’t bring them with you.

366
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,914
Senior, I won’t bring them with me.

367
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,036
I’ll just keep them in my room.

368
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,749
Under the bed. I won’t look at them often.

369
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,901
No.

370
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,164
Just one. Just give me one.

371
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,974
After you finish your training,
I’ll give them back to you.

372
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:50,677
If that’s the case, can you give
me the Sound Bell for a moment?

373
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:53,439
I want to talk to Si Feng
for one last time.

374
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,828
At first, I wanted to tell him about me
coming to Xuyang Peak

375
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,030
after everything is settled here.

376
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,634
Si Feng?

377
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,402
The disciple of Lize Palace?

378
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:07,908
Xuan Ji, you won’t be able to meet him.

379
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,039
What’s the point of contacting him then?

380
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,873
You just promised me that
you’ll listen to me.

381
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,521
I have no choice then.

382
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:20,005
I’ve made a deal to meet
Si Feng four years later.

383
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:23,325
I’ll just train well first and
visit him in the future.

384
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,297
Why do you look so upset?

385
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:33,631
Since I took so many of your
things, how about I give you a gift?

386
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,080
This is awesome!

387
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,974
Every person in training needs to have
a personal magical weapon.

388
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,208
I’ll give you this Parting Umbrella
as your weapon then.

389
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,279
Awesome.

390
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,359
When I go out in the future,
I just need to bring this umbrella, right?

391
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,081
Not only it’s a magical weapon,

392
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:24,213
it can even shield me from rain and sun.

393
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,926
Thank you, Senior.

394
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:27,893
You really like to slack off.

395
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,799
Senior, after I have this magical weapon,

396
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,565
does it mean that I can win even if
I don’t practise my spells?

397
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,287
Although it has some power in it,

398
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:41,693
if you are not well-trained,
you won’t be able to use it well.

399
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:43,525
You can’t slack off.

400
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:46,146
Now, can you see
the importance of training?

401
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,979
I get it now, Senior Hao Chen.

402
00:27:01,158 --> 00:27:04,679
That 13 Punishments Lianyu Pagoda
has 13 floors.

403
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,493
All 13 floors are full of vicious beasts,
monsters and evil spirits.

404
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:09,734
Devilish formations
that erode the soul and heart.

405
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:15,718
The one who is punished has to
climb from the bottom to the top

406
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,464
to be able to survive it.

407
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,973
Xuan Ji.

408
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,216
I’m afraid that I’ll be in a hard battle
for quite a while.

409
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:36,998
But I won’t forget about our deal.

410
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,319
I’ll definitely come out alive.

411
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,734
Senior. I’m late.

412
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,323
Go ahead and punish me.

413
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:16,239
Why should I punish you?

414
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,526
Because... Because I slacked off

415
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:23,087
and didn’t get up in the morning to train.

416
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:28,399
If you are awake but your heart is not,

417
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,799
it’ll only have the opposite effect
on your training.

418
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,974
Don’t worry.
I won’t force you to wake up early.

419
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:41,954
You are hungry?

420
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:58,416
You want to eat it?

421
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,405
Although you don’t need to
wake up early to train here,

422
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:14,645
we have our own rules.

423
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:17,814
First, we only eat once a day.

424
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,430
If you want to eat,

425
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:23,789
you’ll have to chase it
by flying with your sword.

426
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,140
Senior.

427
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,063
I’m hungry.

428
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:25,119
I’m really hungry.

429
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,451
Bear with it.

430
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:31,239
Well.

431
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,269
I can’t find any flint in my room.

432
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,990
I can’t light up the lanterns.

433
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,727
Learn how to use the fire spell
to light up the candles then.

434
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,808
Light up.

435
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:10,786
Light up.

436
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,919
I’m hungry and it’s dark.

437
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,639
Hurry up.

438
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,881
If you don’t light
up again, I’ll eat you.

439
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,310
Xuan Ji.

440
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,120
These 13 Punishments
are harder than I thought.

441
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,614
I just managed to pass the first level.

442
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:36,085
But I can do it.

443
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,080
But I’m afraid that

444
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,359
it’ll take me longer than expected
to pass through all 13 floors.

445
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,352
You still haven’t replied me until now.

446
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:54,463
I don’t know if you can hear me or not.

447
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,734
Is the bell too hard for you to use

448
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,313
or did you lose the bell?

449
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,760
Senior Duan Qing.

450
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,599
Xuan Ji.

451
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,392
Did you just go to collect some nectar?

452
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:48,959
Yes. I love the nectar
from various flowers.

453
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,637
So, I just collected some of them
from the valley just now.

454
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:54,361
- Can I taste it?
- Sure.

455
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:01,424
So sweet.

456
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,599
Senior Duan Qing,
is this bottle full of nectar too?

457
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,782
Yes.

458
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:10,301
Can you give it to me then?

459
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:11,509
Well.

460
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,039
Can I make you another one?

461
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,966
This bottle is for someone else.

462
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,343
Who?

463
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:22,206
It... It’s someone I like.

464
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,691
I have someone I like too.

465
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:26,039
Then, you’ll understand.

466
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,722
If you really like someone,

467
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:31,073
you’ll want to share the thing
you like the most with him.

468
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:36,679
Sharing the things I like
with the person I like.

469
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,400
Is everyone like this?

470
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:41,721
Alright, Xuan Ji. I have to go now.

471
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,166
Since I’ve decided to like Sixth Senior,

472
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,804
I’m going to leave
some of my fruits for him.

473
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,015
Senior Hao Chen.

474
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,479
Finally, you don’t need
to be hungry anymore.

475
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,365
Senior Hao Chen,
haven’t I improved a lot lately?

476
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,709
You can fly quite okay now.

477
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,179
Tomorrow, you’ll take a spell test
with other new disciples from outside.

478
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,168
Why?

479
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:54,159
You’ve studied in Xuyang
Peak for quite some time.

480
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,758
Today, we are going to test
your basic spell skills.

481
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:00,560
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

482
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,373
Xuan Ji.

483
00:36:04,374 --> 00:36:06,239
I taught you myself.

484
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,638
Don’t embarrass me.

485
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,279
Don’t worry, Senior Hao Chen.

486
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,075
I’m ready.

487
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,039
Let’s start.

488
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,413
Lightning Spell.

489
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:50,796
Wind Spell.

490
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,411
Okay.

491
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,189
Burrowing Spell.

492
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,453
Xuan Ji. You can go first.

493
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,581
Thank you, Senior Hao Chen.

494
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,919
Your spell is okay.

495
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,295
But you need to improve on
your physical capability.

496
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:16,879
This is how you prepared for the exam?

497
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,736
I won’t do it again.

498
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:23,190
Have you ever thought
that if it rained today

499
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:25,933
and it washed off all the spells
you copied on your dress,

500
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:27,375
what are you going to do?

501
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:32,254
Luckily, it’s not raining today.

502
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:36,831
You should at least find a fool-proof way
if you are going to cheat.

503
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:40,382
That’s it for today’s test.

504
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,246
All of you have improved a lot.

505
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,740
- Continue to work hard tomorrow.
- Yes, Senior!

506
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:56,639
Great. Now that I’ve embroidered them on,
I won’t forget about these spells.

507
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,768
And they won’t be washed off too.

508
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,213
Senior, you are not angry, right?

509
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,381
As long as you know how to use it.

510
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:07,389
No matter what method you use,

511
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,599
be it memorising it or carrying
it with you, it’s not important.

512
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,999
You are so kind.

513
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,941
Now, I can use any spells.

514
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,941
When I see my seniors and juniors
when I go back to Mount Shaoyang,

515
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,679
they’ll be shocked that I’ve improved

516
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,639
when I show them these five spells.

517
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,879
You can just barely perform
those spells right now.

518
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,518
It’s not something to be proud of yet.

519
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,078
From now on, you have to work harder
to strengthen your spells

520
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,369
so that you can defeat
real monsters and demons.

521
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,551
What? You already want to ambush
me with these petty skills of yours?

522
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:44,743
You are wrong, Senior.

523
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,926
I never thought that you can
break the spell to my wine cellar.

524
00:39:54,927 --> 00:39:56,545
You’ve improved.

525
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,270
I’ll have to borrow this as a gift then.

526
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:05,797
This wine is for you.

527
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,438
But can I drink a little bit of it?

528
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,119
I’ve been craving for it lately.

529
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,149
Senior, the wine you brewed
is really delicious.

530
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,431
It’s the best.

531
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:28,353
Don’t drink so much.
I don’t want you to be drunk.

532
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,312
Senior, I’ve been wanting to ask you this.

533
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:39,199
You are so amazing and many
seniors and juniors like you.

534
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,602
Are you really going to give up
all of your feelings

535
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:46,510
to learn that Heartless Tactics
and guard the secret ground forever?

536
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,226
I’m born to guard that secret ground.

537
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:53,518
Only by being heartless can I
get rid of the turmoil in this world

538
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,617
and neutralise the demons inside everyone.

539
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,040
Don’t you want to be with your friends?

540
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:05,654
Friend?

541
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:11,429
I used to have a friend.

542
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,590
We were very close.

543
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:17,868
But she betrayed me and
committed a grave crime.

544
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,162
It’s too bad that
I didn’t realise it sooner.

545
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:27,231
If I could help her out earlier,

546
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,174
perhaps

547
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,053
she wouldn’t be like this today.

548
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,845
Betrayal?

549
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,639
Then, she is not a real friend.

550
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,719
My friends are all splendid.

551
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,363
They won’t do this kind of thing.

552
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,222
Humans are unpredictable.

553
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,049
Your friends might change.

554
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,759
Xuan Ji, one day, you’ll understand that

555
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,859
only by focusing on becoming a deity

556
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,879
can you get rid of
all your worries right now.

557
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,321
Understand?

558
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,917
Yes.

559
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:21,371
Are you still unwilling to become
a deity because you are still angry?

560
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:25,798
Is this the life that you want?

561
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,294
Do you know that I’m here
to bring you back?

562
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:36,158
When we go back, can we
still be together like before?
