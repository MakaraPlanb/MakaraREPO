00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,169
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,433
<i>EPISODE 55</i>

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,688
Xuan Ji.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,690
Xuan Ji!

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,664
Xuan Ji.

6
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,126
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

7
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,719
Si Feng!

8
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,119
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng! How are you feeling?

9
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,420
Are you okay, Si Feng?

10
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,111
Si Feng.

11
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,531
Si Feng.

12
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,088
From now on, you are no longer
the Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,262
You’ll be the heaven’s God of War.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,559
From tomorrow onward, you
will be serving the heavens.

15
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,588
You’ll be the one to annihilate the Asuras

16
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:35,910
and destroy the Demon Citadel.

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,028
It has been 1,000 years.

18
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,656
Finally, this day has come.

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,999
Greetings, Demon Lord.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,366
Congratulations for coming back
to the three realms.

21
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,021
Yuan Lang?

22
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,799
I remember now.

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,219
You were the Left and
Right Lieutenant of King Asura.

24
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,799
Looks like you still remember me.

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,417
I’ve been waiting for 1,000
years for you to be revived.

26
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,367
Thank you for giving me
a physical body again.

27
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:55,199
I’m willing to fight
the heavens with you

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,719
to finally seek revenge for
Demon Citadel after 1,000 years.

29
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,490
You can follow me then.

30
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,319
Yuan Lang, you stupid bird.

31
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,831
You are really a bad penny.

32
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:06,208
He believes you because
he has been sleeping for 1,000 years.

33
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,073
Let me tell you.
I won’t let you escape today.

34
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:13,079
Wait. I remember that the heavens
has tortured you for 1,000 years too.

35
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,754
Don’t you want to kill them
together with me to avenge yourself?

36
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,430
I indeed detest those people
from the heavens.

37
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,559
I fought with them and
stole their things 1,000 years ago.

38
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,799
So, it’s only normal that
they locked me up.

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,967
But now, they even dared
to hurt my Little Fox.

40
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,775
Besides, I found out today that

41
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,359
Bailing was so shameless
to do that to you.

42
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,718
You were once the person
I admired the most.

43
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,679
And Xuan Ji is my good friend.

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,420
- So, I have to avenge all of you.
- Good.

45
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,959
Looks like I didn’t misjudge you.

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,970
But I have to kill this stupid bird today.

47
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,103
I don’t care what kind of grudge
you have between you.

48
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:00,930
Before we destroy the heavens, I
don’t want there to be internal conflict.

49
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:04,399
After we seek our revenge,
you can kill whoever you want.

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,770
Just go ahead and do it.

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
Fine.

52
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,962
After all, that Bailing is more
shameless than this zombie here.

53
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:24,730
I’ll kill Bailing first,
and then, I’ll kill you.

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,010
If that’s the case, come
with me to Fenru City now.

55
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:35,266
I want to give a present
to the heavens.

56
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,719
King Bailing, Rahu Ketu
has already destroyed Fenru City

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
and broke the Core Fire.

58
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,450
He even went to Demon Citadel
to revive the Asuras army.

59
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,587
What about Shen Shu and Yu Lu?

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,142
Please have mercy on us!

61
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,273
Good-for-nothing.

62
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,479
- King Bailing.
- Tell me.

63
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,039
What bad news is it this time?

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,639
Rahu Ketu sent us a war declaration

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,388
stating that he’ll attack the heavens
and drench it with blood.

66
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:34,535
I never thought that
my compassion back then

67
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,146
will lead to him acting so arrogantly now.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,974
He wants to attack the heavens?

69
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,268
Fine.

70
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,887
Pass down my decree.

71
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,639
Put the whole heavens
on high alert now.

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,679
We won’t give him an opportunity
to take advantage on us!

73
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,825
Yes, King Bailing.

74
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,324
Xuan Ji.

75
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,173
Xuan Ji.

76
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:06,959
Xuan Ji.

77
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,999
Xuan Ji!

78
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,159
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,374
Where is Xuan Ji?

80
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,458
Si Feng, Xuan Ji has already
turned into Rahu Ketu now.

81
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,799
- It’s pointless to look for her!
- I want to look for her.

82
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,319
Calm down!

83
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,279
Even if she’s Rahu Ketu,
she’s still Xuan Ji!

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
Si Feng, Xuan Ji has become
Rahu Ketu. She’s gone.

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,239
Rahu Ketu has summoned all demons
to Demon Citadel to greet him.

86
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,277
He’ll lead an attack towards the heavens
and bring chaos to three realms.

87
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,759
When you were unconscious,

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,159
demons are already acting
so rampantly in the human realm.

89
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,310
Now, no one dares to come out.

90
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:38,281
The world is in a mess now.

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,959
No. Xuan Ji must be still alive.

92
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,851
She’s just controlled by
Rahu Ketu for now.

93
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,439
- I’ll look for her tomorrow.
- No.

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,799
Majority of demons are gathered at
Demon Citadel now. We can’t be reckless.

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,919
I think we better discuss it
with Master first.

96
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,479
I’ll go! You are mortals but I’m a demon.

97
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,918
Since it’s a gathering of demons,
the more reasons for me to go.

98
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,199
Si Feng.

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,599
A lot of elders who didn’t obey him

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,497
- had been killed.
- Yes.

101
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:05,223
- I’m worried that you...
- No.

102
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:09,199
Even if she’s controlled by
Star of Mosha’s soul, I’ll find her.

103
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,830
Star of Mosha’s soul has been harboring
hatred for 1,000 years in the Jade Cup.

104
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:15,279
As soon as it combined with
Xuan Ji’s primordial spirit,

105
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,930
I’m afraid that her mere 20 years of life

106
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,039
is just nothing compared to Rahu Ketu’s

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,450
- tens and thousands of years of memories.
- Yes.

108
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,479
Bailing sealed up her six senses and
took away all of her memories.

109
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,727
He even transformed into Hao Chen and
yet couldn’t stop her from becoming him.

110
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,439
From that, you can see
how deep Rahu Ketu’s hatred is.

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,867
Little Phoenix,
you can’t risk your life like this.

112
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,119
Why are you so unconfident in Xuan Ji?

113
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,639
Although Rahu Ketu’s soul
is controlling her now,

114
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,126
it doesn’t mean that
she’s completely gone.

115
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,451
Rahu Ketu has hatred in his heart
but Xuan Ji has love in her heart.

116
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:49,399
I don’t believe that someone can totally
forget about the person they once loved.

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,398
I believe that Xuan Ji is still alive too.
We can save her.

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,239
It doesn’t matter

119
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,850
whether she’s God of War or Star of Mosha.

120
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,530
I will stop Rahu Ketu

121
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,142
and bring back Xuan Ji.

122
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,269
Please advise him against this.

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,863
Okay.

124
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,319
If that’s the case,
I won’t stop you anymore.

125
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,468
You...

126
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,239
But you have to remember this.

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,239
The more people Rahu Ketu kills,
the more demonic he will become.

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,414
If you want to get Xuan Ji back,

129
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:22,020
you have to stop her from
slaughtering people without restraint.

130
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,999
Greetings, Demon Lord!

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,269
Welcome back to three realms!

132
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,919
The heavens destroyed
Demon Citadel 1,000 years ago.

133
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,422
Us demons were scattered across the realms
and were suppressed and bullied.

134
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:50,646
Now that I’m back, I’m going
to stir up the three realms

135
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,176
to restore the power and dignity
of us demons.

136
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,228
On the seventh day
of the month of seventh,

137
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:00,559
I’ll use the Fallen Bell to burst open
the heaven’s gate and attack them.

138
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,295
Go and swear a blood oath with
the Right Lieutenant later.

139
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:06,427
Then, we’ll slaughter everyone
in the heavens together.

140
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,679
Attack the heavens!
Slaughter everyone there!

141
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,730
Restore the power of demons again!

142
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:17,759
This is Demon Lord’s first order
and someone is already defying it.

143
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,308
Well done.

144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,410
My clan has little power. The spirit
is willing, but the flesh is weak.

145
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,332
I hope that...

146
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:42,114
Since you are of no help,
why should I keep you?

147
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,454
Demon Lord, you said that we’ve been
suppressed and bullied for 1,000 years.

148
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,711
You want to lead us to
fight against the heavens.

149
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,455
We came here because we respect you.

150
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,839
But not every clan is good at combat.

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,439
How can you just kill us like that?

152
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,903
Insolent!

153
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:01,086
He was just gone for 1,000 years
and now, even a mere Green Sparrow

154
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,545
is teaching him how to lead?

155
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:07,079
You are humiliating us just like
how the heavens treats us.

156
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,198
Goodbye!

157
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,410
Calm down, Demon Lord.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,530
The heavens annihilated us Asuras
and drove away the rest of your demons.

159
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,659
All of you have been hiding for
more than 1,000 years in fear.

160
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,810
At first, I thought that all of you will
look forward to seeking revenge.

161
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,421
But I never thought that
this insult of 1,000 years

162
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:38,730
will turn you into mellow
and obedient cowards.

163
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,839
As demons,

164
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,496
are you really going to just hide
in the human realm and be slaughtered?

165
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:49,503
I won’t accept this
kind of humiliation.

166
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:52,114
And it’ll be the same
for every demon clan!

167
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,237
I don’t care if you want to
swear the blood oath or not.

168
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,999
From today onward,
we are no longer separated by clans.

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,999
All of you will obey me.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,292
We’ll gather here at the seventh day
of the seventh month.

171
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,295
This is an order, not a discussion.

172
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:06,596
Those who disobey me

173
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,850
will be killed without mercy.

174
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,287
Yes, Demon Lord!

175
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,503
You are dismissed.

176
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,368
Si Feng?

177
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,925
Yu Si Feng.

178
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:26,614
It’s you?

179
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,837
12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird?

180
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,062
I know that Xuan Ji’s
consciousness is still there.

181
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,247
She won’t let you commit
the sin of murder.

182
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:44,533
Let her out!

183
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,202
Si Feng.

184
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,617
Si Feng!

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,623
Si Feng!

186
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,525
Si Feng!

187
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,737
Xuan Ji.

188
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,033
You became Rahu Ketu to save me.

189
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,349
Have you forgotten about me
now that you’ve become Rahu Ketu?

190
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,349
Si Feng!

191
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,863
Rahu Ketu, let me out!

192
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,474
Let me out!

193
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,922
Chu Xuan Ji is just the image of
my primordial spirit.

194
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,698
Since I’m already
back, she is gone now.

195
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:36,602
Stop mentioning about this lowly mortal’s
name again and again in front of me.

196
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:40,086
Xuan Ji will not be gone.

197
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,483
I’m sure that she’s still here.

198
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,872
She was controlled

199
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:47,483
by your soul because
she wanted to save me.

200
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,650
Although she was once
part of your primordial spirit,

201
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,679
she had gone through 1,000 years
with 10 reincarnations.

202
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,192
She’s her own person now.

203
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:59,199
She’s not Rahu Ketu.

204
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,330
Xuan Ji.

205
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,868
I know that you are inside him, right?

206
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,650
Rahu Ketu, let me out!

207
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,919
So what if she’s here?

208
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,414
So what if she’s not?

209
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,890
She’s just a small portion
in this long life of mine.

210
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,359
Among my tens and thousands
of years of memories,

211
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,869
hers is just a drop of water in the ocean.

212
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:27,517
Do you think she can control me?
Dream on.

213
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,479
Since you once risked your life
to protect my primordial spirit,

214
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,890
I’ll not kill you.

215
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,787
Get lost now.

216
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,799
I promised Xuan Ji
that I’ll bring her back.

217
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,519
I won’t leave until she appears!

218
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,975
Si Feng, wake up, you dummy.

219
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:49,650
- He’s not Xuan Ji now.
- I believe in Xuan Ji!

220
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:52,073
She is not the Star of Mosha.

221
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,553
And she doesn’t want to
become Star of Mosha.

222
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:00,329
Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?

223
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:03,561
You won’t.

224
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,890
Because Xuan Ji
won’t allow you to kill me.

225
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:11,919
I already said that she’s just
a part of my primordial spirit.

226
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,366
Do you think that you can stop me?

227
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,033
You tried so hard to lock Xuan Ji up

228
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,810
and used your power to
take the form of Rahu Ketu

229
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,319
because you are afraid.

230
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,479
You are afraid that you can’t control her.

231
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,830
You are afraid that

232
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,082
she won’t turn into a
bloodthirsty demon like you.

233
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,727
Let me out!

234
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,117
Let me out! Si Feng!

235
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:36,460
Si Feng!

236
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,063
Si Feng!

237
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,519
Let me out!

238
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,966
- Xuan Ji.
- Let me out!

239
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,397
Let me out!

240
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:54,639
Let me out! Si Feng!

241
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,421
Si Feng!

242
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,627
Xuan Ji.

243
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,530
Si Feng!

244
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,359
Si Feng.

245
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,161
Si Feng.

246
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,921
Xuan Ji.

247
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,333
Xuan Ji.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,919
You are back, Xuan Ji.

249
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,519
I knew it.

250
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,159
I know that you are still here.

251
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
You won’t disappear.

252
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,170
Si Feng, why are you so foolish?
He’ll kill you.

253
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,030
I said that I’ll get you out
no matter what.

254
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,222
You promised me that you
won’t forget about our vow.

255
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,990
Si Feng. But, I’m Rahu Ketu.

256
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,778
It really doesn’t bother you?

257
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,214
In my heart, you’ll always be
Xuan Ji no matter what happened.

258
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,319
But I’m not me anymore.

259
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,159
I’m afraid that I can’t control myself.

260
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,706
I’ll kill you.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,279
What we had in the past
will forever be gone.

262
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,959
Si Feng, forget about everything.

263
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,530
Forget about her.

264
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,083
You are not Xuan Ji.

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,666
Xuan Ji won’t ask me
to forget about our past.

266
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,737
Yu Si Feng, you are really sentimental.

267
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,247
Your memories with Chu Xuan Ji
are very precious, right?

268
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:39,607
But to me, they are just
boring and embarrassing.

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,223
Boring?

270
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,560
Embarrassing?

271
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,816
You are just jealous of Xuan Ji.

272
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,239
You were betrayed.

273
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,119
But you hate her.

274
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,630
Because you’ve never obtained
this kind of feelings before!

275
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,971
Yu Si Feng.

276
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,382
I’m going to get rid of Chu
Xuan Ji’s memories and you now.

277
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,531
Demon Lord.

278
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,559
Demon Lord.

279
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,839
You want to fight
the heavens, right?

280
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,010
I’m sure that you still
need a helper, right?

281
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,822
I’m a 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.
With my power,

282
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,527
not many can be my match.

283
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:22,056
Why don’t you consider me?

284
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,885
Let me become your helper.

285
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:28,134
Demon Lord, he’s really a good fighter.
I can attest to that.

286
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,126
Fine.

287
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,217
If he can withstand one blow from me,

288
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,839
I’ll accept him.

289
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
Bring it on.

290
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,283
Stop! I won’t allow you to hurt Si Feng!

291
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,187
I won’t allow you to hurt Si Feng!

292
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,319
Let him go!

293
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,830
Rahu Ketu!

294
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,190
I already said that I’m very powerful.

295
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,839
You should keep me by your side.

296
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,066
Fine.

297
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:25,135
Yu Si Feng, I’ll hand over
the Fallen Bell to you.

298
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:26,559
After 10 days,

299
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,930
I want it to be filled with resentment
and use it to tear down the heaven’s gate.

300
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,390
I won’t disappoint you.

301
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,159
Yu Si Feng!

302
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,719
Don’t think that I don’t know
what you are planning.

303
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,079
Chu Xuan Ji is just
a speck of dirt in Demon Lord’s life.

304
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,399
Don’t ever think about
getting back Chu Xuan Ji.

305
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,599
Demon Lord is back in the three realms
to seek revenge from the heavens.

306
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,239
Don’t think that
you can ruin his ambition.

307
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,559
Yuan Lang,
why are you getting so agitated?

308
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,443
Are you afraid that you’ll lose your place
because he’s hotter and more powerful?

309
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,599
I just don’t want to let someone
with an ulterior motive

310
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,439
to stay by Demon Lord’s side.

311
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,878
Si Feng!

312
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,909
I chose him myself.

313
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,679
So, I’m the only one who can
punish or award him.

314
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,450
Don’t ever think about touching him.

315
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:45,672
Those who disobey me

316
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,903
will not be forgiven so easily.

317
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,767
These are the prisoners we caught
from the human realm recently.

318
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,519
We’ll feed them to the Fallen Bell.

319
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,638
Feel free to use them.

320
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,559
Thank you.

321
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,374
But feeding this Fallen Bell
souls are not an easy task.

322
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,110
It’s a dangerous chore.

323
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,319
You may leave me alone here with them.

324
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,050
I don’t want to accidentally feed
this bell with any of you in here.

325
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,670
If that’s the case,
we won’t disturb you then.

326
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,526
We’ll wait for your good news.

327
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,596
Let’s go.

328
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,559
- Don’t come over here! Don’t kill us!
- Don’t kill me!

329
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,680
Don’t kill us! I beg you!

330
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,988
Left Lieutenant.

331
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,159
Left Lieutenant,
we found a suspicious-looking person.

332
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,359
She’s wearing a mask and looking around.
She might be a spy from the heavens.

333
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,999
- Bring me to her.
- Yes, Left Lieutenant.

334
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,368
- Both of you can wait for me here.
- Yes, Left Lieutenant.

335
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,800
- Don’t kill us.
- Don’t worry.

336
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,500
I won’t hurt you.

337
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,268
Leave through the back of the mountain
now that it’s night-time.

338
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,919
Continue north and you’ll find an exit.

339
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,330
If you go out from there,

340
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,513
you can go back to the human realm.

341
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:32,199
Come out.

342
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,039
- Let’s go now.
- Let’s go.

343
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,188
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

344
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,103
- Let’s go.
- Thank you.

345
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,803
Little Fox, why did you
come to Demon Citadel?

346
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,839
Let me tell you. Wait for me here.

347
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,980
Wu Zhi Qi.

348
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,639
I don’t want to wait anymore.

349
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,639
You were detained in Fenru City for
1,000 years and I waited for you.

350
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,639
And I waited for you when you
helped Xuan Ji opened Jade Cup.

351
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
Now that you want to go to war with
the heavens, how can I wait again?

352
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,225
You’ve just gotten your freedom. Why
are you putting yourself in danger again?

353
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,236
What if you are caught by
the heavens again?

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,759
I don’t want to live another
1,000 years of suffering.

355
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,730
I can’t believe you, you sour fox.

356
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:58,679
I’m going to war soon.

357
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,879
Wu Zhi Qi.

358
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,709
You know better than me how
the Demon-Immortal War ended.

359
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,519
No matter who wins,
what has it got to do with us?

360
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,487
We’ll still live our own lives in the end.

361
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,930
If that’s the case,
why do you have to be involved in this?

362
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,527
Isn’t it nice to leave now

363
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:19,854
and go back to that little hut with me
to live our life in peace?

364
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:22,639
You don’t like me in human form? Fine.

365
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,639
- I’ll turn back into a fox. As long as...
- Little Fox, look up there.

366
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,877
Tens and thousands of demons are waiting
to seek revenge from the heavens.

367
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,663
We have to seek revenge too!

368
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:34,159
Have you forgotten who ruined your face
and locked me up for so long?

369
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,679
I’ve endured them for more than
1,000 years! I can’t endure it anymore!

370
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,290
We should’ve gone to war 1,000 years ago.
I’m going to beat them up today!

371
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,599
Little Fox.

372
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,326
Just wait for me here.

373
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,807
Don’t worry.

374
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,647
It won’t take long.

375
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:09,206
I’ll take down White Tiger Star Lord

376
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,439
and use his fur to make a cape for you.

377
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,680
Then, I’ll extract his core and
spread it on your face.

378
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,170
Wait for me.

379
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,690
Wu Zhi Qi.

380
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:31,793
This is the last time I’ll beg you.

381
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,484
If you don’t leave with me,

382
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,301
I’ll go into hiding

383
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,364
and you’ll never find me again.

384
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,922
Little Fox.

385
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,599
I know what kind of power you have.

386
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,930
Where can you hide?

387
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,818
Stop fooling around.

388
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,945
Wait for me.

389
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,399
What kind of golden ray is that?

390
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,039
I think it’s the Fallen Bell!

391
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,589
It’s the Fallen Bell that broke
the heaven’s gate 1,000 years ago.

392
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,310
It still exists?

393
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,937
Demon Lord. Once the war
starts, it’ll poison the three realms!

394
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:42,937
Keep quiet!

395
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,983
Wu Zhi Qi, listen to my command.

396
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,774
Attack the heavens now.

397
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,399
Okay.

398
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,930
Here I go.

399
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,279
King Bailing.

400
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,302
King Bailing, they are coming.

401
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:42,239
We can’t hold them back without
the heaven’s gate.

402
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,239
- Let’s retreat.
- Retreat?

403
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,806
Why should we retreat?

404
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,387
They are the one who should retreat.

405
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,839
Pass down my order.

406
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,319
Tip over the Mutton Fat Jade Jar

407
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,479
and release the Sea of Life and Death.

408
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,530
Separate the heavens
with the human realm!

409
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:05,439
King Bailing.

410
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,639
If you release the Sea of Life and Death,
it’ll disrupt the cycle of universe aura.

411
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,758
The corrupted aura will then accumulate
and it’ll turn into another Demon Citadel.

412
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,088
Humans will perish.

413
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,269
Please take back your order!

414
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,319
We have the order of priority.

415
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,978
The heavens is in grave danger now,
we have to protect ourselves first!

416
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,439
Jade Emperor is not here.

417
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,334
I’m in charge here.

418
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,791
Do as I say now.

419
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,783
If you hesitate, you’ll be
beheaded without mercy!

420
00:28:57,856 --> 00:28:59,017
What is that?

421
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,927
Sea of Life and Death.

422
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:40,369
You rather use the Sea of Life and Death
at the cost of the human realm?

423
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,765
Fine.

424
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,860
Let’s see how long you can hide up there.

425
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,172
Little Fox!

426
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:45,159
Little Fox. Are you okay?

427
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,490
Stupid Monkey.

428
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,537
You...

429
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,418
You just care about fighting, right?

430
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,490
Why...

431
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,639
Why do you care about me now?

432
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,183
Little Fox.

433
00:30:58,184 --> 00:30:59,903
Are you dumb?

434
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:02,121
Why did you do that? Why?

435
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,874
Yes.

436
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,932
Why is it

437
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,170
so painful?

438
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,186
You are my everything.

439
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,217
You can throw away your life

440
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,839
but I don’t want you to die.

441
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,359
Little Fox.

442
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,759
Stay strong.
I’ll find you the best medicine.

443
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,458
I’ll cure you for sure.

444
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,022
No.

445
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,607
Stupid Monkey.

446
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:30,325
You’ll definitely keep

447
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:32,698
your promise to others

448
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,293
without any care for your life.

449
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,768
You don’t even care about me.

450
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,038
I care about you.

451
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:46,759
Just that sometimes,

452
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,481
I don’t know what to say.

453
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,999
Little Fox, don’t worry.

454
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,806
I won’t let you suffer anymore after this.

455
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,930
Stupid Monkey.

456
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,905
This promise

457
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,064
is already enough for me.

458
00:32:07,616 --> 00:32:08,864
Wu Zhi Qi.

459
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,927
You made promises with others everywhere.

460
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,987
Can you

461
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,759
promise me something too?

462
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,781
Okay.

463
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:21,826
After I die,

464
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:27,110
can you bring me back?

465
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,748
Let’s leave the Demon Citadel.

466
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,772
Stop fighting.

467
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,104
Okay.

468
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:34,597
I promise you, Little Fox.

469
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,600
I won’t fight anymore.

470
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,084
I won’t fight anymore, Little Fox.

471
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,114
Can you

472
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,608
kiss me?

473
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,050
Wu Zhi Qi.

474
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,257
I...

475
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,463
I love you.

476
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,375
Wu Zhi Qi.

477
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,239
In the next life,

478
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,024
- Little Fox!
- I don’t want to become fox anymore.

479
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:52,930
- Little Fox!
- I’ll become even more beautiful

480
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,869
with the appearance that you like.

481
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:58,562
If I become like that,

482
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,484
will you like me then?

483
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:08,076
Little Fox.

484
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,178
I’ve been lying to you.

485
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,622
You are beautiful.

486
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,566
You are really attractive.

487
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,090
Brother Wu. What has happened outside?

488
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,340
I won’t fight anymore.

489
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,602
I’ll get you out.

490
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,623
Brother Wu.

491
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,687
What happened?

492
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,006
Little Fox is dead.

493
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,601
I promised her that I won’t fight anymore.

494
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:24,149
So, I came here to save you.

495
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,044
Let’s go.

496
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,735
Both of you are just going to leave
without goodbyes?

497
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:34,306
Such disrespect for Demon Lord.

498
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,159
Demon Lord, I’ve already said that
Yu Si Feng is going to rebel.

499
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,130
Now, looks like Wu Zhi Qi
wants to leave too.

500
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,368
Both of them are traitors.

501
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,719
Wu Zhi Qi.

502
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,308
I respected you 1,000 years ago.

503
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:52,359
And now, you are the only one who
doesn’t need to address me as Demon Lord.

504
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,055
I treated you well.

505
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,767
Why are you leaving me
now that we are defeated?

506
00:35:57,768 --> 00:36:00,018
Is it just like what Yuan Lang said?

507
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,170
Are you going to betray me?

508
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,730
I don’t know what betrayal means.

509
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:11,050
Just now, Little Fox
died saving me from that battle.

510
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,961
I’ve already promised her
not to fight anymore.

511
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:17,338
I’m going to bring her home
and bury her demonic core.

512
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,287
Rahu Ketu.

513
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,951
I think I’ve repaid you enough for

514
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:26,402
speaking up for me
to King Asura back then.

515
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:30,935
From now on, I’m no
longer in debt with you.

516
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:32,139
Old Wu.

517
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,839
You want to bargain with Demon Lord?

518
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,603
Aren’t you too arrogant?

519
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,603
What did you say?

520
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:43,354
I misunderstood you then.

521
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,511
Being sentimental and loyal
are your best qualities.

522
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,959
I wasn’t expecting you to pay me back
when I spoke up for you back then.

523
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,622
Since you want to leave now,
I won’t force you to stay.

524
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:56,898
You can leave.

525
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,470
But Yu Si Feng has to stay.

526
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,952
Yu Si Feng, you put down
an order to foil our military plan.

527
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:07,519
That’s a fatal crime.

528
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,310
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

529
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:13,119
Rahu Ketu,
you have Xuan Ji’s memories inside you.

530
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,455
I did it so that you won’t commit
even more sins of murder

531
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:17,790
and suffer in the future.

532
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:21,207
I can kill you.

533
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,918
I can let you go too.

534
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,250
Xuan Ji is making you to do it, right?

535
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,708
Don’t think too much.

536
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:33,599
For me, Chu Xuan Ji is just a
fragment in my mind. She’s powerless.

537
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,010
But you are quite interesting.

538
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:41,727
How about this? I know that
you are the leader of Rose Gold Bird.

539
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,599
If you do something for me,

540
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,650
I’ll forgive you for the crimes
that you’ve committed.

541
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,399
What is it?

542
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,085
Find the Rose Gold Bird,
order them to burn their demonic cores

543
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,188
and carry my army over
the Sea of Life and Death.

544
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,535
Burn their demonic cores?

545
00:37:56,536 --> 00:38:00,191
You’ll destroy their cultivations
and turn them into cripples.

546
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,370
It’s their honor to be able to die
for Demon Lord.

547
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,086
Yu Si Feng.

548
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,511
Just agree to it.

549
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:14,650
Unfortunately, I’m already not
their leader since a few years back.

550
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,623
So, I don’t know where they are.

551
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:21,110
But Yuan Lang is the Rose Gold Bird
with the most advance cultivation.

552
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,302
With his power,

553
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:25,530
he can fly through that sea
for seven to eight times without problem.

554
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,478
You can bestow to him this honor of
burning his demonic core instead.

555
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,719
Yu Si Feng.

556
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,039
I’m giving you a chance because
I think that you are very amusing.

557
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,770
Don’t be so imperious.

558
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:41,250
Since you won’t tell me about
the Rose Gold Bird’s whereabouts,

559
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,617
I’ll have to kill you.

560
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,119
I really don’t know.

561
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,079
If you don’t believe
me, just kill me then.

562
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,328
Okay.

563
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,199
Brother Wu.

564
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,202
Rahu Ketu, Si Feng is my friend
and my savior.

565
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,519
If you want to kill him, I’ll help
him even if it’ll cost me my life.

566
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,641
Brother Wu.

567
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:12,359
Demon Lord, they are obviously
trying to revolt against you.

568
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,095
Just kill them to prevent
any future troubles.

569
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,830
Interesting.

570
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,999
I haven’t seen such loyalty in
a friendship for a long time.

571
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,857
It’ll be a pity if I kill you both.

572
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,569
But if I just pardon Yu Si Feng like this,
others will think that I’m unfair.

573
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,140
What a dilemma.

574
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,093
How about this.

575
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,187
If the two of you can withstand
three attacks from me,

576
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:42,359
I’ll consider that Yu Si Feng
has paid for his crime.

577
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,631
But if you die,

578
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,242
you can only blame yourself for
not being powerful enough.

579
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,967
Demon Lord.

580
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:52,759
Rose Gold Bird is useful to us.
We can’t let Yu Si Feng go.

581
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,210
I’ve already made up my mind.
No need to say anything else.

582
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,617
Brother Wu!

583
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,947
Si Feng!

584
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:08,847
Si Feng, how are you?

585
00:40:09,586 --> 00:40:11,116
Don’t worry. I’m fine.

586
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,839
You are using the Solar Palm from
the Golden Crow Tactic to attack yourself

587
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,370
in order to expel the demonic power
of the Ocean Wave?

588
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,688
Interesting.

589
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:32,432
But both of you are
seriously injured right now.

590
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:36,170
The third one, Soul Breaker, will attack
your heart and soul. It’s very dangerous.

591
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,300
You still want to try it?

592
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,101
Sure.

593
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,787
If we are to die here together
today, I’ll be content with that!

594
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,607
Do it now.

595
00:40:57,608 --> 00:40:58,867
Okay.

596
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,337
Little Fox.

597
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:34,675
Xuan Ji?

598
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:38,199
Si Feng.

599
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,399
Si Feng!

600
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,227
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji!

601
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:43,211
Si Feng!

602
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:45,148
Si Feng!

603
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,919
Xuan Ji.

604
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,176
Don’t be afraid. I’ll find
you and bring you back!

605
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,358
Little Fox.

606
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:08,599
- Brother Wu.
- Little...

607
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,256
Brother Wu.

608
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:12,559
- Are you okay?
- Si Feng.

609
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,668
I’m fine.

610
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:17,319
Yu Si Feng, you managed to
withstand the Soul Breaker.

611
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,358
Looks like you are very determined.

612
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,905
I’ve changed my mind about you.

613
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,970
You’ve withstood my three attacks.
I’ll keep my promise.

614
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,079
- You can go now.
- Si Feng.

615
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,210
Let’s go.

616
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,090
Brother Wu.

617
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,439
I can’t leave with you.

618
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,911
Foolish kid.

619
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:38,959
If you stay, they won’t let you go.

620
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,474
If I leave now, I won’t
be able to forgive myself.

621
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:45,654
I promised that I’ll stay with Xuan Ji.

622
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,970
No matter what happens to her,

623
00:42:48,497 --> 00:42:49,955
I’ll stay with her until the end.

624
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,039
Just now, I’ve already felt her presence.

625
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,761
She must be waiting for me.

626
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,974
Brother Wu.

627
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,128
I’m sorry for wasting your effort.

628
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,564
If I was the old me,

629
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,810
I would laugh at you for having no guts.

630
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:10,490
But now, I have only admiration for you.

631
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:12,705
If I were like you

632
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:16,165
and realized this sooner,
Little Fox would be...

633
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,959
Forget it.

634
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,311
Si Feng.

635
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,550
I’ll be leaving then. Take care.

636
00:43:24,512 --> 00:43:25,868
See you later.

637
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,174
Yu Si Feng.

638
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:35,079
You wouldn’t tell me about your clan’s
whereabouts and you wouldn’t leave.

639
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,330
Are you testing my patience?

640
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,570
I stayed because I want to
make a bet with you.

641
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:43,721
I bet that within three days,

642
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,888
I can call forth Chu Xuan Ji
from the depth of your heart.

643
00:43:49,488 --> 00:43:52,970
What will you do if you win and
what will you do if you lose?

644
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,810
If I can do it within three days,

645
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,782
you can’t seal her at
the bottom of your heart anymore.

646
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,553
Let her out to speak with me.

647
00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:05,287
If I can’t do it
after three days,

648
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:08,279
I’ll put my life in your hands forever.

649
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,279
Who do you think you are?

650
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,219
How dare you bet with Demon Lord?

651
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,447
Rahu Ketu, do you dare to
take on this bet?

652
00:44:16,793 --> 00:44:18,222
Fine.

653
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,039
I have a condition too.

654
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,959
If you can’t call forth Chu Xuan Ji
within three days,

655
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,374
I’ll force you to tell me about
the whereabouts of Rose Gold Bird.

656
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,517
How about that?

657
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:29,271
Okay.

658
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:33,739
For these three days, you can
become my personal slave then.

659
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:10,224
These are qingtuan from Zhongli City.

660
00:45:10,939 --> 00:45:12,702
It’s Xuan Ji’s favorite snack.

661
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:22,919
From the aroma of this soup, I can tell
that you’ve put a lot of effort into it.

662
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,413
But this is fruitless.

663
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,999
It’ll be three days already
when tomorrow comes.

664
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,210
You’ll have to admit defeat then.

665
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:35,327
We’ll have to wait until tomorrow then.
