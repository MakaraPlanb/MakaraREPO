00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,327
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:32,526
<i>EPISODE 42</i>

3
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:37,984
Who is it?

4
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,839
Black Hole Cave in front of Mingxia Cave

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,270
can only be opened by
Auntie Ying Hong’s Hongyu Arrow.

6
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,630
I’ll find a way to lure
Auntie Ying Hong away.

7
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,588
Use that chance to go into the room
and steal the Hongyu Arrow.

8
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,038
Si Feng!

9
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:29,279
Si Feng.

10
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,376
Si Feng.

11
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,049
He’s hurt by the Candle Dragon.
How did this happen?

12
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,580
Si Feng, are you feeling better now?

13
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,420
Why are you here?

14
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:04,307
Are you here to question
me or are you here

15
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,355
to use me to threaten someone else again?

16
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,039
I’m here to save you.

17
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:13,961
God of War.

18
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,880
Aren’t you afraid that
your father, senior and

19
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,070
those sects will laugh at you again

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,077
for being entwined
with a demon like me?

21
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:29,361
Yes. Of course I’m afraid.

22
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:32,831
I kept butting head with my father to tell
him that you are not a part of Sky Hall.

23
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,559
But what about you?

24
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,954
What are you doing?

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,312
Since you don’t believe me,

26
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,603
why are you here to save me?

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,847
If it wasn’t because they want to get
your demonic core, I wouldn’t care.

28
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,698
I’ll let you stay in Mingxia Cave forever.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,140
Let’s go.

30
00:03:58,648 --> 00:03:59,797
Xuan Ji!

31
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,306
- Senior Hao Chen.
- Xuan Ji.

32
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,934
Where are you taking Yu Si Feng to?

33
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:09,039
Please forgive me.
I can’t let you extract his demonic core.

34
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,258
Flying Snake.

35
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,059
What is it? I was sleeping.

36
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,623
Hold Senior Hao Chen here.

37
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,636
Let’s go.

38
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,490
What is the meaning of this?
Wait for a moment.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,658
What is the meaning of this?

40
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,060
The connection is back.

41
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:46,014
This is bad. Si Feng is in danger.

42
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,321
Chu Xuan Ji!

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,768
Si Feng, let’s leave through
this secret ground.

44
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,879
Others will be trying to invite
the spirit of Candle Dragon.

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,639
- They won’t think that we’ll use this way.
- Through the secret ground?

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,079
Aren’t you afraid that I’ll steal
your Jade Cup using this chance?

47
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,290
Yu Si Feng, can you don’t be like this?

48
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,919
Now, I really don’t know
what is real is what is not.

49
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,999
I’ve said it.

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,639
No matter you are a demon or a monster,

51
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,340
what can I do? The only thing I can do
is to make sure that you are not hurt.

52
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:16,719
If you really want to take the Jade Cup,
what else can I do besides stopping you?

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,517
I can’t kill you, can I?

54
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,829
Chu Xuan Ji.

55
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,630
I’ll explain it one last time to you.

56
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,091
I only lied to you once.

57
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,812
I’ve never lied to you about
anything else before this.

58
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,359
I don’t care about Sky Hall.

59
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,398
Jade Cup and Star of Mosha
have nothing to do with me.

60
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,221
No matter you believe me or not,

61
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:37,990
from now on,

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,697
I won’t explain it to you again.

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,691
But of course,

64
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,159
you don’t need my explanation.

65
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,639
- Si Feng!
- Master!

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,599
Master, are you okay?

67
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:58,559
Chu Xuan Ji, look at what you did!

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,942
You hurt him so deeply.

69
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,167
Silver Snake.

70
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,039
Master.

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,439
She hurts you so much and
you are still helping her?

72
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,119
I’m not helping her.

73
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,719
The two of us are no match
for the God of War.

74
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,454
I’m just doing this to save our lives.

75
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,079
Stop talking. We need to leave now.

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,420
Or else, we’ll be too late.

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,519
Are you really that kind?

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,813
Let’s go.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,075
Master.

80
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,751
Today is the third day.

81
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,519
We are going to succeed soon.

82
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,120
A few mortals trying to invite
the spirit of Candle Dragon?

83
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,667
Stop wasting your energy.

84
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:58,285
Demon, how did you come in?

85
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,597
I got in the way Yu Si Feng got in.

86
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,944
But I really have to thank him.

87
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:10,210
Without the Candle Dragon, this
secret ground looks quite nice.

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,637
As long as I’m here, I won’t
let you get near to the Jade Cup.

89
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:16,938
Fine.

90
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:19,722
Then, you can all die!

91
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,239
Master!

92
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,340
Master!

93
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,519
What a loving relationship between
the master and disciples.

94
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,221
If that’s the case,
all of you can die together!

95
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,839
I’m on the purple cloud to heaven.
Ninth Heaven,

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,300
I hereby welcome
the spirit of Candle Dragon!

97
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,991
Demon, dream on!

98
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,163
Old man, die!

99
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,456
You’ll reach the bottom of
the opposite mountain through here.

100
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,119
Si Feng!

101
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,305
Si Feng!

102
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:58,620
Xuan Ji, move aside!

103
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,399
- Father!
- What is happening now?

104
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,221
Xuan Ji, you didn’t disappoint us.

105
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,159
You brought Yu Si Feng here.

106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,519
Chu Xuan Ji, you put on a show
to purposely lure Si Feng here, right?

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,479
It’s not like this!

108
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,421
- Si Feng.
- Xuan Ji!

109
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,719
Have you forgotten about
your oath with me?

110
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,279
You and demons will be sworn enemies.

111
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,439
Today, use the power of God of War

112
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,861
to extract the demonic core of
this 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird!

113
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,020
- Everybody, start the formation!
- No!

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,062
No!

115
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,399
No! Si Feng!

116
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,919
Father, no!

117
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,540
- Father!
- Si Feng.

118
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,639
- Si Feng.
- Xuan Ji, we are all mortals.

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,799
Only you can hurt the
12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird. Kill him now!

120
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,359
Father, Senior, please let Si Feng go.

121
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,319
He’s not an evil demon.
Please let him go!

122
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,079
Xuan Ji! Have you forgotten
how your mother died?

123
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,021
Now, you want to watch while
your father dies in front of you?

124
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,755
Father!

125
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,974
Xuan Ji, if you continue to hesitate,

126
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,061
Sect Leader will be devoured by
this strong spiritual power.

127
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:11,820
- Xuan Ji, do it now!
- Stop it!

128
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:15,679
Stop it now!

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,732
Father, I don’t want you to die!
I don’t want Si Feng to die too!

130
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,481
Xuan Ji! What are you doing?

131
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,599
Stinky woman, I was confused by
your senior just now. I didn’t stop him.

132
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,790
Stop talking.
Help me break the formation now!

133
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,576
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji!

134
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,672
Si Feng.

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,660
Si Feng! Are you okay?

136
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,620
Si Feng!

137
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,340
Si Feng!

138
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,020
Si Feng.

139
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,585
Since you swore an oath
to be my sworn enemy,

140
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,510
why are you so foolish?

141
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,442
Why did you risk your life to save me?

142
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,691
You heard it?

143
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,399
I was just lying.
How could you believe it?

144
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,359
I didn’t mean it.

145
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,752
Si Feng.

146
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,713
My primordial spirit.

147
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,269
I’ve been waiting for you here
for too long.

148
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,809
Star of Mosha?

149
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,959
Black Devil’s Snare.

150
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,458
The Demon Citadel Flower.

151
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,730
This is bad.
It is absorbing our cultivation.

152
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,621
Only the Star of Mosha can make
the Demon Citadel Flower bloom.

153
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:58,301
My primordial spirit, come to me.

154
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,559
This is bad.

155
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,639
The Star of Mosha is going to be revived.

156
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,102
Could it be that the one in front
of us is the real Star of Mosha?

157
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,895
It’s you.

158
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:11,614
So, you are the Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

159
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:14,774
Xuan Ji, the Star of Mosha
is right in front of you!

160
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,392
Kill him now!

161
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,614
Impossible, Star of Mosha’s soul
is being sealed inside the Jade Cup.

162
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,242
How could it be Si Feng?

163
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,990
Jade Cup is just sealing
the Star of Mosha’s soul.

164
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,653
Star of Mosha can only be awakened when
the soul and spirit are joined together.

165
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:35,614
Moreover, only Rahu Ketu’s blood

166
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,959
can make the Demon Citadel Flower bloom!

167
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,620
And it feeds on humans’ cultivation!

168
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,707
Xuan Ji!

169
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,218
Who are you?

170
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,645
This is not my blood.

171
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,115
This is Xuan Ji’s blood.

172
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,977
Don’t tell me that Xuan Ji is...

173
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,940
Si Feng.

174
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:19,692
You...

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,508
How can this happen?

176
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,396
Xuan Ji!

177
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,325
That’s right.

178
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:43,396
I’m the Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

179
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,700
You think that I’m just here
for the Jade Cup.

180
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,143
Actually, I’m here
to kill this God of War.

181
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,100
Since you’ve already found out
about my real identity,

182
00:14:57,806 --> 00:14:58,905
now,

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,786
I have to kill all of you.

184
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,893
Si Feng, what nonsense
are you talking about?

185
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,797
Hurry up and kill him!

186
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,869
Father.

187
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:36,355
Stop! All of you!

188
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,368
Si Feng.

189
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,569
Didn’t you say that

190
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,164
you’ve only lied to me once?

191
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,479
Didn’t you ask me to give you
some time to settle everything

192
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,122
and then, you’ll come to me
and explain everything to me?

193
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:13,361
Why?

194
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:16,519
I trusted you again and again.

195
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,500
Why did you lie to me
again and again? Why?

196
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:25,640
Chu Xuan Ji.

197
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,420
I never thought that
you really love me so much.

198
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:32,844
You believed in everything I said.

199
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,550
As long as I can get what I want,

200
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,058
no matter how many times I lie to you,

201
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,977
I think you’ll still believe
in me wholeheartedly.

202
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,734
I’m really touched.

203
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,380
Si Feng.

204
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,610
Si Feng!

205
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,020
Demon, don’t go!

206
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,874
Hurry up and take down the barrier now.

207
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,858
Xuan Ji, how long
are you going to be so foolish?

208
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,780
Chase after him!
We can’t let him run away!

209
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,060
Without the power of God of
War, I won’t be able to touch it.

210
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,669
Junior Ying Hong.

211
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,476
Junior Ying Hong!

212
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,767
Lize Palace.

213
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,940
Why can’t I transfer my energy to it?

214
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,839
All the nerves inside her body are broken.

215
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,580
Auntie Ying Hong!

216
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:59,460
Junior Ying Hong!

217
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,000
How did this happen?

218
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:03,109
It must be because of Yu Si Feng!

219
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,533
Impossible.

220
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,830
- Auntie Ying Hong.
- Don’t touch her!

221
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:12,039
If it wasn’t because
you let that demon go,

222
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,860
she wouldn’t be like this now!

223
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,385
Master!

224
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,500
Master, this is bad. Master Heng Yang...

225
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,709
- What happened to my master?
- He...

226
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,959
Senior!

227
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,818
Senior!

228
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,398
Senior! Senior Duan Qing!

229
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,550
Senior.

230
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,970
Senior!

231
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,113
Master.

232
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,372
- Master.
- Master!

233
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,796
Master!

234
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,795
- Master.
- Master.

235
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,899
Master!

236
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,918
Master.

237
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,786
Master!

238
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,051
Master.

239
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,423
Yu Si Feng.

240
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,304
Auntie Ying Hong

241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,116
can’t cast any spell anymore.

242
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,164
This is all because of me.

243
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:52,439
She is hurt because of me.

244
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,839
Stinky woman.

245
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,742
Why are you here?
I was looking everywhere for you.

246
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,179
It’s like this. I think something is wrong
with that Star of Mosha.

247
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,159
How about this?
Allow me to leave for two days.

248
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,677
I’ll go back the heavens
to check the 1000-year-old scroll.

249
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:11,216
I’ll find out what happened.

250
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,353
Why aren’t you talking?

251
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,892
If you say nothing,
I’ll take it as you’ve agreed.

252
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:21,602
I’ll get going now.

253
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:29,692
Stinky woman,
you were not like this in the past.

254
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:33,558
Don’t worry. I’ll get to the bottom of
this when I’m at the heavens.

255
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,809
Maybe I’ll be able to
return your lover to you.

256
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,446
Xuan Ji.

257
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,987
Master and the others are
waiting for you at Shouyang Hall.

258
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,261
My lord.

259
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:06,839
Rahu and Ketu are going
to come together soon.

260
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,550
Only one more step for them to become one.

261
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,859
He’s going to appear soon.

262
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,170
He was near to the Jade Cup just now.

263
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:28,119
I never thought that Yu Si Feng
is Rahu Ketu, the Star of Mosha.

264
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,159
At first, we planned to extract
his demonic core to show the public.

265
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,790
If it wasn’t because our plan
to kill him was foiled,

266
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,319
we would have already destroyed
the Star of Mosha.

267
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,331
Now that we set the tiger free,
this world will soon fall into chaos.

268
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,925
This is all because of our God of War.

269
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,439
God of War.

270
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,818
We respect you as a deity
and we let you lead us.

271
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,799
But you sided with the demons
and free Yu Si Feng again and again.

272
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,540
For what?

273
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,645
Shaoyang Sect needs to give us
an explanation for today’s incident.

274
00:22:58,646 --> 00:22:59,712
Kong Tong.

275
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,570
Today’s incident happened

276
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,605
because I didn’t teach my daughter well.

277
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:09,123
That’s why

278
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,679
she made this grave mistake.

279
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,820
I’m willing to bear
full responsibility for it.

280
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,999
Father.

281
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,631
Are you just going to settle this
with just a pretty sentence?

282
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:21,956
Stop forcing my father.

283
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:24,894
I’m the one who let him go.
Blame me instead.

284
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:26,980
Xuan Ji, shut up.

285
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,983
You swore an oath about
breaking up with Yu Si Feng forever.

286
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,420
And if you break your promise,

287
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:40,685
your father will be ripped
to death on the street.

288
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,622
Today, I’m going to fulfill that oath.

289
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:47,077
I want to let you see the
mistake that you’ve committed.

290
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,479
Father! No!

291
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,679
Sect Leader!

292
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,159
- Sect Leader Chu.
- Sect Leader!

293
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,339
Father!

294
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,376
I’m the one who enraged you.

295
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,759
You can chop off my fingers or kill me.

296
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,599
Stop forcing my father!

297
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,336
You are the God of War.
Who can hurt you?

298
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,375
Everybody.

299
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,546
I should have

300
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,420
killed myself as an apology today.

301
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,772
But the demons are still out there.

302
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,644
I still have a duty to fulfil.

303
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,066
So, I’ll not take my life yet today.

304
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:27,389
After we get rid of
those demons, you can

305
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,341
punish me however you want.

306
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,437
Today, I’ll break one of
my fingers as a vow to that.

307
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:39,074
But after today, I’m ashamed

308
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,793
to lead Shaoyang Sect.

309
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,853
Hao Chen.

310
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:02,022
Although you are young,
you are very mature.

311
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:05,208
Your cultivation is very advanced as well.

312
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,958
From now on, I’ll hand over

313
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,363
Shaoyang Sect to you.

314
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,489
Sect Leader, you can’t do that.

315
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:18,119
If you don’t accept it,

316
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,370
who else has the rights
to take up this position?

317
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,436
Actually,

318
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:26,740
I will have passed down the position
as sect leader to you anyway.

319
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,869
I’m just doing it earlier.

320
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,220
Hao Chen, I believe you.

321
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,677
You won’t disappoint the world

322
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:38,658
and also the hope that
all sects put on Shaoyang.

323
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,595
Okay.

324
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,629
You are injured today.

325
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,290
So, I’ll keep the Sect Leader Medallion
for you as of now.

326
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,703
Greetings, Sect Leader.

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,052
Changing the sect leader
is none of our business.

328
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,445
But everybody saw that

329
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,733
this God of War has feelings towards
that Yu Si Feng.

330
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,966
She even sacrificed
her own master and auntie.

331
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,899
How can we believe her?

332
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,399
That’s right! If this continues,

333
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,701
there’s no point in
changing the sect leader.

334
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:42,071
Who says that Xuan Ji has feelings
towards that demon?

335
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,532
Xuan Ji and I are the real lovers
who are destined to be together.

336
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,094
Everybody has already known
about it in Fuyu Island.

337
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,140
- Senior Hao Chen, I...
- Xuan Ji.

338
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:57,021
I know that

339
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:59,839
you don’t like to mention about us
being destined together.

340
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,359
You are afraid that people might
misunderstand it as

341
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,906
the reason for us to be together.

342
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,085
Since we already have feelings
towards each other,

343
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:09,501
there’s no need for us to care about
what others think.

344
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,398
It’s already enough if we can spend

345
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,667
the rest of our lives together.

346
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:18,484
In Fuyu Island, God of War told
us herself that the wedding is void.

347
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:21,124
Sect Leader Hao Chen, don’t fool us.

348
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,412
Xuan Ji.

349
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:28,940
Looks like we have to
tell everyone about us now.

350
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:35,645
If that’s the case, let’s tell
everyone about our engagement

351
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:38,759
so that others
won’t misunderstand anymore.

352
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,357
We can let them know that the
mercy you’ve shown Yu Si Feng

353
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,696
is just out of your past friendship.

354
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,547
Hao Chen is the destined partner
for my daughter.

355
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,670
At first, I already planned to conclude

356
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,859
their marriage after
coming back from Dianjinggu.

357
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,199
Besides, they’ve spent so much
time together at Xuyang Peak.

358
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,864
They love each other.

359
00:28:01,478 --> 00:28:02,978
I hope that everyone

360
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,020
can believe in Shaoyang one last time.

361
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,669
If the God of War continues
to keep quiet, how can we...

362
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,879
How can we continue to trust Shaoyang?

363
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,860
Yes, Xuan Ji. All of us
are waiting for your decision.

364
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:39,148
Okay.

365
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:42,307
From now on,

366
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,918
Yu Si Feng and I

367
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,712
will break up once and for all.

368
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,830
Auntie Ying Hong!

369
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:21,124
Junior Ying Hong!

370
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,420
Xuan Ji.

371
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,775
I like you.

372
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:40,160
I like you more than anyone and anything.

373
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:06,096
As long as I can get what I want,

374
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,771
no matter how many times I lie to you,

375
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,940
I think you’ll still believe
in me wholeheartedly.

376
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:14,835
I’m really touched.

377
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,113
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji!

378
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,117
Xuan Ji!

379
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,639
Xuan Ji.

380
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,253
You’ve locked yourself in here
for the whole day and night.

381
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,399
This Ice Blade Punishment is not a game.

382
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,279
All of your six senses have recovered.
You won’t be able to endure it.

383
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,485
Xuan Ji.

384
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:42,439
This incident is my fault too.

385
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,516
If you want to talk about punishment,
I should be punished together.

386
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:48,879
Xuan Ji, can you open the barrier first?

387
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,485
Xuan Ji, since you’ve
seen Yu Si Feng’s true color,

388
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:55,159
you shouldn’t punish yourself for him.

389
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,014
Since he could do that thing to
Auntie Ying Hong and your master,

390
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,639
it means that he’s no longer
the person we know.

391
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,799
He is the Star of Mosha, Xuan Ji!

392
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,077
Stop it!

393
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,676
Can you let me stay here alone?

394
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,839
Go away.

395
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,178
Go!

396
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,543
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji.

397
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:18,170
Ling Long.

398
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,020
- Senior Hao Chen, Xuan Ji...
- I know.

399
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,940
You can leave first.

400
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,692
Let’s go.

401
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,346
Xuan Ji.

402
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,430
He helped me find back my six senses.

403
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:18,279
And he thought me
what it means to be sincere.

404
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,609
But he lied to me

405
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,094
again and again.

406
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:27,808
This is my fault.

407
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,060
I killed my master.

408
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,540
And I hurt Auntie Ying Hong.

409
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,189
This is not totally your fault.

410
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,690
Demons are very good at
disguising themselves.

411
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,221
I stopped you from regaining
your six senses

412
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:46,082
because I don’t want you
to be in pain and to suffer.

413
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,199
This is my fault.

414
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,959
I should’ve stayed by your side
since the beginning.

415
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,666
I shouldn’t let you leave my side.

416
00:32:57,173 --> 00:33:00,540
That way, you wouldn’t have run into
the trap of false display of affection.

417
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,717
Fake one.

418
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,024
All those that happened to me

419
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,490
are all fake?

420
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,269
Aren’t you clear about that already?

421
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:21,341
People’s hearts are unpredictable.

422
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:22,705
You were born without one.

423
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:25,710
It’s even harder for you
to see through it.

424
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,729
You don’t belong in the outside world.

425
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,187
And you shouldn’t have been involved
with people and issues that don’t matter.

426
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,253
But luckily, it’s
still not too late.

427
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:40,221
From now on, you just
need to listen to me.

428
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:43,449
No matter you are happy
or sad, crying or laughing,

429
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:46,578
I’ll forever stay by your side.

430
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,634
I won’t let you go again.

431
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,769
For those demons who lied to you,

432
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,462
we just need to kill them together.

433
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,700
But why?

434
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,451
Why does my heart

435
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,824
feel so painful?

436
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,220
You were once the God of War
who hated all evils in this world.

437
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,554
You shouldn’t be lenient towards him.

438
00:34:19,638 --> 00:34:22,348
But you’ve been corrupted
by the feelings in this world.

439
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:24,008
That’s why you led yourself astray.

440
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,759
Your heartache

441
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,513
is a demon that he planted
inside your heart.

442
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,355
You should have gotten rid of it
and become who you were once.

443
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,911
God of War will not
ache for her enemy.

444
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,857
Kill him

445
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:49,381
and everything will end.

446
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:06,875
I won’t...

447
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:10,280
I won’t let him hurt anyone anymore.

448
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,092
Forget it.

449
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,933
You are exhausted now.

450
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,172
You should rest more.

451
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,052
There are a lot of things that
I’ll tell you later on bit by bit.

452
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,681
Do you know that

453
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,682
you belong to me since the beginning?

454
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:47,944
Although I’m late,

455
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,356
maybe I’m not too late yet.

456
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,651
This time,

457
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,739
I have to bring you back no matter what.

458
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:04,740
I’ve kept the palace of God of War
for 1,000 years for you.

459
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,762
It’s time for you

460
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,310
to go home.

461
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:12,539
You are in love with Yu Si Feng now

462
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:16,657
because you’ve forgotten about
the relationship we had.

463
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,812
You’ve forgotten how depending
you were on me and

464
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,323
how obedient you were.

465
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,342
Maybe

466
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,820
there are things that

467
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:30,706
I shouldn’t let you forget.

468
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:48,725
At first, I planned to hide in
Mount Shaoyang

469
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:51,789
to find a way to break
the barrier of the secret ground.

470
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,445
But I never thought that I’d
personally witness Yu Si Feng

471
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:58,223
rouse the power of Star of Mosha.

472
00:37:16,598 --> 00:37:19,153
That’s right.
I’m the Star of Mosha.

473
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:21,726
This Black Devil’s Snare

474
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,305
blooms from Si Feng’s blood.

475
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,904
There’s really a mark there.

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,999
When Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu,
fought the heavens,

477
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,484
King Bailing left this scar
on his shoulder.

478
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,117
This is the mark of the heavens.

479
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:00,938
It’ll never be gone.

480
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:05,999
Together with this Black Devil’s Snare
that should’ve been extinct,

481
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,500
all of these signs point to Yu Si Feng.

482
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:10,560
Could it be that

483
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,203
he’s the Star of Mosha who
I’ve been looking for all along?

484
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,199
But you told me before that

485
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,812
Star of Mosha has the strongest
malignant aura among the Asuras.

486
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:21,508
He has been sealed for 1,000 years.

487
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:25,159
All his hatred and anger for 1,000 years
will swallow up everything.

488
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,071
And he’ll become a bloodthirsty demon
that will be born for revenge.

489
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:32,078
But Si Feng is not like that right now.

490
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,394
Star of Mosha’s soul is still
sealed inside the Jade Cup.

491
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,518
It makes sense that his demonic aura
and malignant aura are still in slumber.

492
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,693
But

493
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,622
his soul is not back with him yet.

494
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,305
How did he know that
he’s the Star of Mosha?

495
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:08,759
Yuan Lang.

496
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:11,260
Yuan Lang.

497
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,812
Yuan Lang.

498
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,931
You are still the same.

499
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,376
You are Ketu?

500
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,907
You better call me Si Feng.

501
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:50,860
Rahu Ketu has been forgotten for
too long. I don’t remember much.

502
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:53,632
When I was outside of
Shaoyang’s secret ground,

503
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:57,851
I felt a connection with my soul
that is sealed inside the Jade Cup.

504
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,759
He showed me her.

505
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,237
The God of War who killed me and

506
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,698
sealed up my soul when my guard was down.

507
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,275
The funny thing is,

508
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:16,307
I now have this kind of
relationship with her.

509
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:21,130
Now that I remember, I
won’t forget about it again.

510
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:31,428
What is your plan then?

511
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:35,872
Now,

512
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,221
God of War and the other sects
have found out about my identity.

513
00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:43,158
I need to break the Jade Cup
as soon as possible

514
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,804
to get back my lost power.

515
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:48,172
How about you give me those spirit keys?

516
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:52,949
Then, we can go and meet
our old friend, Wu Zhi Qi.

517
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,130
I believe that he’ll help me too.

518
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,366
You want to go to Demon Citadel
to unlock the Dimension Chain?

519
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:09,018
You’ve always wanted me to do it, right?

520
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:12,685
It was none of my business before this.

521
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:14,293
Of course I wouldn’t do it.

522
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:17,213
But now, I can only retrieve my soul

523
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:20,427
by saving Wu Zhi Qi and getting
my Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook back.

524
00:41:21,222 --> 00:41:23,228
Besides, I’m a demon.

525
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:27,020
I’m the only one who won’t be affected by
the malignant aura in Demon Citadel.

526
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,742
You have all the spirit keys now.

527
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,891
What are you waiting for?

528
00:41:33,206 --> 00:41:35,417
Of course we have to wait.

529
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:38,839
We have to wait until full moon
when the moon is at its highest.

530
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,200
The gate of Fenru City
will only be opened by then.

531
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,115
Only then can Wu Zhi Qi escape
when we unlock the Dimension Chain.

532
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:50,774
Now is not the best time
to enter Mount Buzhou.

533
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,858
The best time?

534
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,928
Are you saying
that Wu Zhi Qi and I

535
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,260
won’t be able to open
the gate of Fenru City?

536
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,465
Why should we wait until then?

537
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,519
We’ve been waiting for so many years.
This is nothing.

538
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,149
The closer we are to our target,
the calmer we should be.

539
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,254
We need to make sure that
nothing will go wrong.

540
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,589
You better rest well.

541
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,878
The most important thing is for you
to recuperate now.

542
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:33,854
I won’t disturb you anymore.

543
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,900
You don’t believe that Yu Si Feng
is the Star of Mosha?

544
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:51,698
Whether he’s the Star of Mosha
or not, I need time to prove it.

545
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,082
No matter he’s the Star of Mosha or not,

546
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,661
before his demonic and
malignant aura is awakened, he is

547
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,033
still Yu Si Feng.

548
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,200
Master, why did you admit that
you are the Star of Mosha?

549
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:22,261
Those anomalies were caused by
Chu Xuan Ji’s blood.

550
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:25,221
I know.
You purposely hit Chu Xuan Ji

551
00:43:25,222 --> 00:43:28,340
to stop her blood for her
to hide her true identity.

552
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:33,227
Actually, Chu Xuan Ji is
the real Star of Mosha.

553
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:37,129
Master, you can’t put yourself in danger
because of that Chu Xuan Ji.

554
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:41,389
Don’t tell anyone about Chu Xuan
Ji’s connection to Star of Mosha.

555
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,563
Master.

556
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:48,886
Master.

557
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,039
You don’t even trust me now?
You put a Gag Spell on me.

558
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,197
This is a serious matter. I’m afraid that
you might accidentally spill it.

559
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:58,789
Xuan Ji can’t be the Star of Mosha.

560
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,450
Something must have gone wrong.

561
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:05,180
Maybe Wu Zhi Qi will know
something about it.

562
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,825
Back then, God of War was ordered
to take down Wu Zhi Qi.

563
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,021
But after meeting him, she went on
a rampage in the heavens.

564
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:15,133
Something is wrong.

565
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,853
I can borrow the Star of Mosha’s identity

566
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,300
to meet Wu Zhi Qi.

567
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:22,688
Master.

568
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,055
Have you forgotten?

569
00:44:24,056 --> 00:44:26,880
Chu Xuan Ji swore an oath
to cut away any ties with you.

570
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:30,133
She is so heartless.
But you keep on helping her.

571
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,199
Your Loveless Curse has been
activated twice.

572
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,640
If it’s activated again...

573
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,739
Master.

574
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,388
The most important thing now

575
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:45,057
is to take the Heartless Pill
and forget about Chu Xuan Ji.

576
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:50,119
You can’t risk your life again and again
for her without any care.

577
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,538
I don’t do this

578
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,415
just for her.

579
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:56,827
How can I

580
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,544
let the Rose Gold Bird clan

581
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:05,173
and the safety of three realms be
destroyed under Yuan Lang’s wild ambition?

582
00:45:05,174 --> 00:45:08,831
The identity of Star of Mosha
can be used to stop his evil plan.

583
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:12,645
By the way, before we left Shaoyang,

584
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:15,386
I asked you to get me Xuan Ji’s blood.

585
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:17,424
Give it to me now.

586
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,296
I’ll make up a plan here.

587
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:34,272
Go and tell Brother Liu and Ting Nu that

588
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,423
I need their help

589
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,796
to find Wu Zhi Qi.

590
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,381
Yes, Master.
