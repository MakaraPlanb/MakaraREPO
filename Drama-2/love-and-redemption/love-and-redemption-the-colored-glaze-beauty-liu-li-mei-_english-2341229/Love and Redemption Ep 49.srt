00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,279
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,560
<i>EPISODE 49</i>

3
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
I...

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Si Feng!

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Si Feng!

6
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,239
Purple Fox.

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,598
Xuan Ji.

8
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,519
You came too late.

9
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,439
Si Feng isn’t here.

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,040
I’ve chugged down
all the wine in Lize Palace.

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,279
What brings you here only now?

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,399
I’m out of wine now.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,679
Little Fox.

14
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
You’re a pathetic fox.

15
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,996
Wu Zhi Qi.

16
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:33,479
Great!

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,051
Ever since you escaped,

18
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:37,296
I haven’t had the chance
to beat the crap out of you!

19
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,567
Come on, let’s fight!

20
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:39,839
Flying Snake.

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,399
We’re not here to fight today.

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,799
No?

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,639
I thought the God of War is
here to kill me, the big demon.

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,079
Si Feng did save you and
swear to be your brother.

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,600
I guess you’re not a malicious demon.

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,799
I’m here to look for Si Feng.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,919
There’s a lot of misunderstandings
between him and me,

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,519
and I’d like to ask for his forgiveness.

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
But I haven’t found him.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,040
I didn’t expect you to be
so straightforward.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,839
Do you know where he is?

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,439
Of course, but I can’t tell you.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
I’ve promised him not to say.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,040
So, pretty God of War,
don’t put me in a tough spot.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Fine, I won’t.

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,039
Oh, that’s right.

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,879
I’ve heard that the divine weapons
is used to seal the Jade Cup.

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,960
I’d like to retrieve it.

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Let me ask you this, then.

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,199
Back then, we took you
to the Demon Citadel

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,079
so King Asura would let us off.

42
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,039
Now, I’m curious as to what you saw there

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,560
that twisted your temperament
and made you attack the heavens.

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
I don’t remember.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,160
The heavens took away my memories.

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,559
Looks like the heavens can never
change their sneaky old habits.

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
Right, Little Snake?

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
The heavens has its own rules.

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
What rules?

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,880
So the heavens
is faultless, isn’t it?

51
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,239
Whatever.

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,759
I don’t really care about
that millennial-old grudge

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,359
between the heavens and the demons.

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,719
Now, I just want to be free.

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,839
As for the divine weapons,
I’ve passed it to Si Feng.

56
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,679
It’s in safe hands, I’m sure.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,039
You’ll just have to find him, if you can.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,159
However... However what?

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,319
However, I’ve heard that he’s been trying

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,039
to stop the Loveless Curse cast upon him,

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,920
so he took a Heartless Pill
to forget about his own past.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,440
That’s why I’m afraid
he’s probably forgotten you.

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
He wants to forget me?

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,919
If you ask me, you should let him go.

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,759
You are not mere commoners.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,319
The world is your oyster.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,199
Since you can finally
part ways and move on,

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,480
isn’t that a perfect end?

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,879
Getting troubled over love

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,440
is the stupidest thing
in the world, isn’t it?

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,279
The stupidest thing I’ve
done is losing Si Feng.

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
That’s why I will find him.

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,919
Even if he hates me or despises me,

74
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,040
I’ll explain everything to him
when I find him.

75
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,399
Looks like your current life

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,719
is much more interesting than
your stint in the heavens.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,960
Fine, to each their own.

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,079
Everyone has different paths.

79
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,839
I’ve said all that I can say.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,479
I’ve finished the wine too.

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,919
Time to go.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Oh, right.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,719
It’s a Perfect Fruit from
the kingdom of Aolai.

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,439
It can mask your presence
in the three realms

85
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,039
so you can avoid certain troublemakers.

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,239
Prevention is key.
No need to thank me.

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,999
I gave one to Si Feng too,
so if you want to find him,

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,680
I’m afraid it won’t be easy.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I’m off.

90
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,039
That stupid monkey is just bluffing.

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,079
We’re just looking for someone.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,120
- It’s easy.
- Can you do it?

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,440
This place is filled with Si Feng’s scent.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,880
Give me a former possession of his.

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,040
Si Feng gave me this.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Try it.

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I’ll try.

98
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
Why did it run off?

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,719
What’s going on?

100
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,319
I guess the Perfect Fruit
does work after all.

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,560
My magic went slightly out of control.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,319
You can leave a message
on the wind chimes.

103
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,959
If you have something that
you’re embarrassed to tell someone,

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,559
you can write it on the wind chimes.

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
The wind will pass your message.

106
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,760
There is something I want to tell you.

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
But...

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,200
I can’t write it on the wind chimes.

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
I will bring the secret to my grave.

110
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
I don’t want anyone to read it.

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,480
I think we should keep it for now.

112
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,960
I’ve locked my secret in here.

113
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,960
You can read my secret once you open this.

114
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:43,846
<i>[You asked me if I’m a demon.
Sorry, I lied to you.]</i>

115
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:47,919
You wrote your secret in here,
yet you want me to open it.

116
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,199
So, do you actually want me to read it?

117
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,080
I’ve always wanted to tell you who I am.

118
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,920
But before I could do so, many
things happened all at once.

119
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I swear.

120
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,960
This is the only thing
that I’ve hidden from you.

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Si Feng.

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
So...

123
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,000
So this is what you’ve
always wanted to tell me.

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,520
You never wanted to deceive me.

125
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
It’s my fault.

126
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Why didn’t I think of opening it?

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,560
What a fool I am.

128
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
I was

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
and still am a fool.

130
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,160
Si Feng.

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,999
Little Fox, here.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,920
Come, here.

133
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
Little Fox.

134
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,360
Let’s drink to our farewell today.

135
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,400
Farewell?

136
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,359
What are you saying, Stupid Monkey?

137
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
What farewell?

138
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
You see.

139
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,079
I was trapped underground
for over 1,000 years.

140
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,599
Now that I’m finally out, of
course I’m going to wander around.

141
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,159
But if you keep following me,

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,359
how can I have fun
with the beautiful ladies, right?

143
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,679
So, you can find a place
to train by yourself.

144
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,120
- Won’t you?
- What beautiful ladies?

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
I’m a beautiful lady myself.

146
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
How should I put it?

147
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,800
At first glance, you look fine.

148
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,199
But I’d get bored eventually.

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Take food as an example.

150
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,719
How boring would it be
if I eat the same food every day.

151
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,759
I love trying new things every day.

152
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
Now that’s life.

153
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,920
Stupid Monkey.

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,240
Are you treating me like mere air?

155
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
No, you’re not air.

156
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,159
You’re a little pet.

157
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,160
You’re a furry, cute little fox.

158
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,839
- Stupid Monkey.
- Little Fox.

159
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,919
I didn’t wait 1,000 years
just to hear you say that.

160
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,199
Don’t you fancy me at all?

161
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,680
Not even a tiny bit?

162
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,960
Wu Zhi Qi.

163
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,480
Can you answer me?

164
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
Do you like me?

165
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,120
Come on, I know you’re awake.

166
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Stupid Monkey.

167
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Yes.

168
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,559
I stayed with you for hundreds of years
in the form of a fox.

169
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,559
I do like you, I love chasing after you.

170
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,319
I wish I could stay inside your arms
just for a short while.

171
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,680
Even if I liked you first, so what?

172
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Can’t you love me the least bit?

173
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
Is it so difficult for you to like me?

174
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Stupid Monkey.

175
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,880
Stupid Monkey, wake up.

176
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Wake up.

177
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,240
If you don’t wake up,

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
I’m kissing you.

179
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,839
Wu Zhi Qi.

180
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,799
You must have had too much
to drink again last night.

181
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,679
I’ve prepared breakfast for you.

182
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,959
I even brewed some tea.

183
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,600
Do you like your breakfast?

184
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Drink some tea.

185
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,319
Little Fox.

186
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,760
Why are you still here?

187
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,160
Drink up first.

188
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,999
Don’t think that I don’t
know you’re chasing me away.

189
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,759
You think those lowly tricks
can tick me off?

190
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,040
You must have underestimated me, then.

191
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,399
I’ve decided.

192
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,599
From now on, I’m following
you wherever you go.

193
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,319
Even if you won’t let me
follow, I’ll cling onto you.

194
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,439
I didn’t wait for the past
1,000 years for nothing.

195
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,159
Wherever you go, I’ll follow.

196
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,679
If you peek at other
ladies, I’ll destroy your eyes.

197
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,159
Anyway, as long as I’m around,

198
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,279
I don’t want to see you with any ladies
within a three-foot radius.

199
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,519
I’m betting my life on this.

200
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Let’s see if you can bear to leave me
when I’m with you for another 1,000 years.

201
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,999
I’ve already brought you here,

202
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,590
so it’s time for you
to honor your promise.

203
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,720
Tell me, where did you hide my sister?

204
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,198
Now, or else I’ll destroy this feather!

205
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,590
I’ll reduce you to ashes!

206
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:56,720
Wu Zhi Qi, where are you going?

207
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,479
Wu Zhi Qi, where are you going?

208
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,440
Little Fox, if you can catch
up to me, then I’ll tell you.

209
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,360
Wait for me!

210
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Who’s there?

211
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
- Ruo Yu.
- Silver Snake.

212
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,839
What are you doing here?

213
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,799
I’m here to look for Si Feng.

214
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,639
But his presence is getting weaker.

215
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,119
I’m afraid he’s getting further from me.

216
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,599
That’s why I’m here to take a look.

217
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,919
But why is Lize Palace empty?

218
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,559
Where’s everyone?

219
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,399
I just came back,
so I don’t know what happened too.

220
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,479
Silver Snake.

221
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,639
The vice palace lord has kept
my sister here for 10 years.

222
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,959
I’m here to bring her back home.

223
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Sister?

224
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Ruo Yu!

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Ruo Xue!

226
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
- Ruo Xue!
- Ruo Yu.

227
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
What is it?

228
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Ruo Xue!

229
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:15,759
Ruo Xue!

230
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,239
Ruo Xue!

231
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Ruo Xue!

232
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,839
Ruo Xue.

233
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,999
Ruo Xue.

234
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ruo Xue.

235
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,239
Brother.

236
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,159
Am I finally free?

237
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,279
Yes, you are.

238
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,959
I’m bringing you home now.

239
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
How nice.

240
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Silver Snake.

241
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,639
Look, my sister is as
mischievous as you are.

242
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
She’s sulking because I came late.

243
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,720
She’s sulking, that’s why
she’s pretending to be asleep.

244
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Ruo Xue.

245
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,039
Stop that.

246
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,280
I’m bringing you home.

247
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,759
Wake up.

248
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,920
Don’t scare me.

249
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Don’t scare me!

250
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,639
Ruo Xue.

251
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I know.

252
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,559
You’re angry because I came late.

253
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,600
Rest up now.

254
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
When you’re awake...

255
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,560
When you’re awake, I’ll bring you home.

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,719
So, you did all that to Si Feng
because your sister was held...

257
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,040
Anyone who works
for the vice palace lord

258
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,919
has a loved one held captive
by the vice palace lord himself.

259
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,000
If we rebel,

260
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,279
he’d torture our loved one to death.

261
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,320
As long as Ruo Xue could
stay alive, I could do anything.

262
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,080
I could abandon morals.

263
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,279
I could abandon friends.

264
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,320
I could even abandon my life.

265
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,640
I’m the one who should die, not Ruo Xue.

266
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
So you did that for someone you love.

267
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:37,000
Forget it. I won’t blame you
since you have your reasons.

268
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,399
Do you know?

269
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Among all the places in Lize Palace,

270
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,039
Ruo Xue loves this spot the most.

271
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,520
When we first left Lize Palace,

272
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,640
we didn’t know things
would transpire into this.

273
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
As orphaned Rose Gold Birds,

274
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,320
we even thought we were in paradise.

275
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
We first met here.

276
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,280
Back then, you just gained
the form of a human.

277
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,440
You looked so much
like Ruo Xue from the back.

278
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
Do you remember
the first question you asked me?

279
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,399
Back then, you insisted
to drink sea water.

280
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,480
I couldn’t stop you.

281
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,400
After you drank it, you asked me

282
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,919
why the sea water is salty.

283
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,880
I... I don’t remember.

284
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,000
It’s been so many years.

285
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,400
Everything I did was to free Ruo Xue.

286
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,640
But my wish couldn’t come true.

287
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,440
Right now, I only have one wish.

288
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,159
I hope you can live well.

289
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,439
Wherever you are,
whoever you’re with,

290
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,600
as long as you’re still alive, I...

291
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,840
I would feel that there’s
something worth living for me.

292
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Promise me.

293
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Silver Snake, live well.

294
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,360
If you need any help, as long
as I can do it, feel free to tell me.

295
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,720
My biggest wish now

296
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,559
is to terminate
my blood contract with my master.

297
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,639
Of course, I want to do it amicably.

298
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Then, I can truly be
myself and stand before him

299
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,120
and love him with all my heart.

300
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
Very well, I’ll help you.

301
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,159
I’ve read before that

302
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,919
the Asuras were pioneers
in taming spirit beasts.

303
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,680
That’s why they’re
familiar with blood contracts.

304
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,359
Back at the Demon Citadel,
I’ve read some obscure books.

305
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,040
I think we can find a solution in them.

306
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,039
Really?

307
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,319
Let’s go, then!

308
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
I’d love to go there too.

309
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,079
Yuan Lang’s remnants are still there.

310
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,479
I need to destroy them
to avoid future troubles.

311
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
Isn’t he already dead?

312
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,720
It’s a long story.

313
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
I’ll tell you everything on our way there.

314
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,200
No wonder Si Feng has been
impersonating as the Star of Mosha.

315
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,960
So this is the truth
he’s been trying to hide.

316
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,959
Are you leaving us to find Yu Si Feng?

317
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Yes.

318
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
But, Xuan Ji.

319
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,199
You know you’re a
human, and he’s a demon.

320
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,240
- How can you...
- Father.

321
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,079
Everything is crystal clear now.

322
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,880
He has never done anything malicious.

323
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,160
He wanted me to believe him.

324
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,680
But I still judged him like
any other sect would have.

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,200
I regret not trusting him
like how he trusted in me.

326
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,199
Regardless of whether he is human
or demon, or even the demon lord,

327
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,320
I want to be with him forever.

328
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,760
Even if he has done nothing,
he’s been avoiding you.

329
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
He doesn’t want you to find him.

330
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,160
Do you want to look for him forever?

331
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,799
But, Xuan Ji.

332
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,679
You are now the God of War.

333
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,759
Everyone hopes you can stay
and protect the mortal world.

334
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,999
Father.

335
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,720
Sky Hall no longer exists now.

336
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,799
For now, everything is safe.

337
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,760
Even without me around, nothing
will happen to the mortal world.

338
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,320
I’ve thought about it.

339
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,320
In this life, I am just Chu Xuan Ji.

340
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,640
I am not the God of War.

341
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
I know you have been hoping that

342
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,160
I would become a heroine
who can bring peace to the world.

343
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,000
But I just want to be a commoner.

344
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,399
I can feel that no matter
how victorious the God of War is,

345
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,640
despite her shining armor,

346
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,680
her heart is nothing but empty.

347
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,520
For this life, I just want
to lead a common life.

348
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,199
I want to be with
someone, be a dutiful wife

349
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,560
and reside in a place of my choosing.

350
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,840
Si Feng is that special someone
that I want to be with.

351
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Father.

352
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,320
When I find Si Feng,

353
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,040
and if you still don’t want
to associate yourself with the demons,

354
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
then...

355
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,680
Then I shall not return.

356
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Get up.

357
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,239
Silly child.

358
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,920
What are you talking about?

359
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Fine.

360
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,840
You may go.

361
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,280
If you ever feel tired,

362
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,040
just come back.

363
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,640
Shaoyang will always be your home.

364
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Xuan Ji!

365
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Xuan Ji!

366
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Ling Long.

367
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,239
Are you here to persuade me?

368
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
No.

369
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,399
I’m here to give you some money.

370
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,719
I’ve been saving it for myself.

371
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,200
I think you’ll find it useful.

372
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,639
I should be following you,

373
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
but I can’t leave when
Little Six hasn’t recovered.

374
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
I’m sorry.

375
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Xuan Ji.

376
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,679
I believe you will find him.

377
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
I’ll be waiting for you two.

378
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Flying Snake.

379
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,159
She’s your master.

380
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,360
Take good care of her.

381
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
What a nag.

382
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I’m off.

383
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,480
Stinky woman, where are we going now?

384
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,040
Actually, you don’t have to follow me.

385
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,479
Weren’t you enjoying all
the good food in Shaoyang?

386
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,800
You can stay back for more.

387
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,720
What, am I an unwanted presence now?

388
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:07,959
Flying Snake.

389
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,279
Do you know any ways

390
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,879
to break a blood contract
without hurting anyone?

391
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,440
What? You’re breaking our contract?

392
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Really?

393
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,999
I tamed you as my beast
to attack Sky Hall.

394
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,879
But now, this is my personal quest.

395
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,440
I can’t drag you down
just to look for Si Feng.

396
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,959
I’ve been helping you
with my whole heart,

397
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,759
and you’re not appreciating at all!

398
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,959
Fine, terminate all you want!

399
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,799
I’m going, I’m not following you!

400
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Haven’t you been pestering me
to terminate our blood contract?

401
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,599
That was the past.

402
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
Things are different now.

403
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,559
You’re mad?

404
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,399
Fine, I won’t mention it anymore.

405
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,880
Since you’re a good fighter,
I can’t bear to let you go.

406
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,279
That’s enough.

407
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,320
Please forgive me, Lord Flying Snake.

408
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,279
That’s more like it.

409
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,439
But remember this.

410
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,880
You pleaded me first.

411
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,480
That’s why I’m going the extra mile
to help you this time.

412
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,639
So, where shall we head now?

413
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,639
Let’s go to somewhere you two have been.

414
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,160
Maybe Little Phoenix is there.

415
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Have you two been here?

416
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,080
This is the place Si Feng and I

417
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,600
defeated Gudiao and saved Ting Nu.

418
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,919
Back then, he didn’t smile much.

419
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,440
He was always stern and cold.

420
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,880
But he actually looks very handsome
when he smiles.

421
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,480
Cheers!

422
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Thank you.

423
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
Si Feng loves eating lotus seeds.

424
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
But he said

425
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,840
the core of the seeds is bitter.

426
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,079
Lotus seeds?

427
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,280
Why are they bitter?

428
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,520
This is a lotus seed.

429
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,120
The core is bitter.

430
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,080
It tastes awful when you bite it.

431
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,520
It’s like what you’d feel
when you’re upset or down.

432
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,039
There are some tastes
that you’d love to try.

433
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,480
But you just can’t have it,
even when it’s right in front of you.

434
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
That’s what you call

435
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
desire.

436
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,000
Si Feng taught me about different tastes.

437
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
He said bitterness

438
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,160
means unhappiness.

439
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,879
But he’s been through
so much bitterness for me.

440
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,320
When I find him, I won’t let
him go through that anymore.

441
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,799
Let’s go.

442
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
I have to find Si Feng.

443
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,720
Enjoy your food.

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,360
We stayed in this inn before.

445
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,720
Here’s your food!

446
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,480
- Excuse me.
- Coming!

447
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Do you still have empty rooms?

448
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,919
It’s you.

449
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,119
You know me?

450
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,399
Of course I do.

451
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Weren’t you the heroine
who captured the Quru Bird?

452
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Then, do you still remember this man?

453
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,520
Back then, he’s always wearing a mask.

454
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,639
Him?

455
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,799
I remember him quite well.

456
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,840
Have you seen him?

457
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
Well, I haven’t.

458
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,519
But I remember that
for some unknown reasons,

459
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,439
he’d wake our chef up
in the middle of the night

460
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,319
to learn how to cook.

461
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,160
He said there’s a fussy eater that
he has to please no matter what.

462
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,599
I’ve never seen someone so clever.

463
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,360
Even our chef is impressed
by the dishes he can prepare.

464
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
This way, please.

465
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Here we are.

466
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,759
Excuse me, can your chef prepare
food that’s better than Si Feng’s?

467
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,239
Yes.

468
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
Get him to prepare us some food.

469
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
Our chef is not here.

470
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,639
Are you turning me down
because I look poor?

471
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,800
No, no.

472
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
- Bring me to him.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,559
Xuan Ji.

474
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,910
I made this for you.

475
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Si Feng.

476
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Stinky woman.

477
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:26,010
What are you thinking?

478
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I didn’t expect that

479
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:31,424
the yard in Qingmu Town

480
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
has been burned to ashes.

481
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,360
Even the tree with wind chimes
is no longer there.

482
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,640
That holds special memories
for me and Si Feng.

483
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,840
Why has things become like this?

484
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
Stinky woman.

485
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,520
Don’t be sad.

486
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
It’s destined.

487
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Destined?

488
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800
I don’t believe in destiny.

489
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,960
I want to control my own life.

490
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Forget about that.

491
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,952
Stinky woman.

492
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,760
What’s our next destination?

493
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,840
I’ve reminisced about everything
between Si Feng and I.

494
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,240
All that came to my mind
is what he did for me.

495
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,880
But I was so cruel to him.

496
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,520
I even stabbed him.

497
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,560
He must have been so hurt.

498
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Flying Snake.

499
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,880
Si Feng is so nice,

500
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,080
but why am I so awful?

501
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,986
Oh, right.

502
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,959
Where does Liu Yi Huan live?

503
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,759
Doesn’t he have a celestial eye?

504
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,200
I’m sure he can find Si Feng.

505
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Brother Liu.

506
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,799
The east wind thaws the winter.

507
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,600
The east wind thaws the winter.

508
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,479
The insects come back to life.

509
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,640
The fish swim to the water’s edge.

510
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,679
The otters hunt for fish.

511
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,840
The otters hunt for fish.

512
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,560
The geese fly here.

513
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,600
The son of Heaven lives in
the left chamber of Qingyang.

514
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,839
Old Fogey, I told you not to put
your head on the window.

515
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,040
It’s scary.

516
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,439
You little wench.

517
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,880
Is that how you speak to your dad
after taking etiquette lessons?

518
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,360
So, what did you score
for your test today?

519
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:58,199
<i>DISTINCTION</i>

520
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,039
- I want a pinwheel.
- Sure!

521
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,439
- Make that two.
- Of course.

522
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
You deserve it, my dear.

523
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,319
Wait, I thought you’ve always
barely passed your tests.

524
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
Why a distinction today?

525
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,679
That’s simple.

526
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,519
All I had to do was to cast a spell,

527
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,559
and I copied the answer scheme
onto my test paper.

528
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,119
- You...
- You made a promise, no regrets!

529
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
You naughty brat, stand right there!

530
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,999
This is Qingyang City.

531
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,559
Brother Liu stays here.

532
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,639
Si Feng has always been close with him.

533
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,800
Maybe he even came to visit him.

534
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
Let’s search.

535
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Brother Liu!

536
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,319
Can anyone stay in
a stinky place like this?

537
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Si Feng is a fussy guy, and
this old bird is the exact opposite.

538
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,679
He’s not here.

539
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,480
Are you looking for someone?

540
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
She touched me?

541
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,800
Are you looking for Deity Liu?

542
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,319
Ma’am, do you know where Brother Liu is?

543
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,160
He must be visiting his daughter
at the academy again.

544
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,160
Wait here, they’ll be back soon.

545
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Very well.

546
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,679
These stupid toys sure cost a fortune.

547
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,440
I’ll make them myself next time.

548
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,279
- Brother Liu.
- Sister Xuan Ji.

549
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,000
Yu’Er, let’s go out for lunch!

550
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Brother Liu.

551
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,480
What are you doing here?

552
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,799
We have nothing to entertain you.

553
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,839
Sister Xuan Ji, forget about that old guy.

554
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,120
Come on, let’s go in!

555
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,760
What? I know you’re a glutton.

556
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,959
Sister Xuan Ji, take a seat.

557
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,200
Let me get you some tea.

558
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,040
Yu’Er has regained her demon form.

559
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,799
Seeing you two here
sure dampens my mood.

560
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,560
We’re doing really fine now.

561
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,079
Anyway, don’t ask me
where Little Phoenix is.

562
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,359
I don’t know.

563
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,639
Brother Liu, I know I was wrong.

564
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,999
Just reprimand me.

565
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,680
I’ve been trying to find Si Feng
so I can apologize.

566
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,760
Why should I reprimand you?

567
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,160
Does it matter as to who’s right or wrong?

568
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,439
Little Phoenix has
been through hell for you.

569
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,359
You should let him live
the rest of his days in peace.

570
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,439
That would be a great help.

571
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,199
The rest of his days?

572
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,359
What do you mean?

573
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,919
Wu Zhi Qi said he ate a Heartless Pill.

574
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,240
Didn’t he take it?

575
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,240
Did his curse act up again?

576
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,399
He ate it.

577
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,199
That’s why he’s already forgotten you.

578
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,839
He doesn’t remember you.

579
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,080
Stop looking for him.

580
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,519
You know Little Phoenix.

581
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,079
He looks easygoing at first
glance, but he’s obstinate inside.

582
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,759
To him, it’s all or nothing.

583
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,879
Now, he has chosen to leave.

584
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,519
He’s not changing his mind anymore.

585
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,559
Brother Liu.

586
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,920
I really know I was wrong.

587
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,480
I’m angry at myself too.

588
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,639
Before I met Si Feng,

589
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,520
I never knew what it means
to be loved by someone.

590
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,759
It was Si Feng who made me feel.

591
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,959
No matter what happened to
me, he was always behind me,

592
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,079
protecting and guarding me.

593
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,400
He treated me gently.

594
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,680
I took everything for granted.

595
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,120
But I really didn’t know he’s
suffered so much for me.

596
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,559
I only know now that
I’ve hurt him deeply.

597
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,239
That’s why I must find him.

598
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,040
I want to tell him
that I know how to love now.

599
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,319
Brother Liu, please help me.

600
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
This time,

601
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,159
I want to start all over again with him.

602
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,280
It’s my turn to protect him, please?

603
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,039
Stop wasting your breath on me.

604
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,800
I’m a stubborn guy myself.

605
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,400
What’s with you, you old fogey?

606
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,839
Even you could give yourself
the chance to be a good father.

607
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,199
Why can’t you give Xuan Ji
a chance to find Si Feng?

608
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,319
Besides, you need the doer
to undo what she has done.

609
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,640
Perhaps Little Phoenix is waiting
for Xuan Ji to resolve his troubles.

610
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,040
Brother Liu.

611
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
You know that

612
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,960
my past nine lives with Si Feng
all ended in tragedy.

613
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,879
I don’t want history
to repeat itself this time.

614
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,319
I want to change.

615
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,120
I want a happy ending this time.

616
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,999
I know you care for Si Feng.

617
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,879
Trust me, I won’t hurt him this time.

618
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,279
Even if he doesn’t
fall in love with me again,

619
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,239
I’ll stay by his side
just like how you are with Yu’Er.

620
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,640
I’ll protect him forever.

621
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,199
That’s enough, Old Fogey.

622
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,359
Stop hiding.

623
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,319
You always sigh when
you mention Si Feng anyway.

624
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,679
Who knows, things might turn better
if Sister Xuan Ji approaches him.

625
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,080
Just tell her.

626
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Stupid wench, why are you
supporting an outsider?

627
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,760
Forget it, there’s no point
in letting you know.

628
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,160
I really don’t know
where Little Phoenix is.

629
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,639
You should try searching in the south.

630
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,479
Target places filled with energy.

631
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,240
Maybe you can find him there.

632
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:42,839
Thank you, Brother Liu.

633
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,079
I will bring him back.

634
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,160
Let’s go, Flying Snake.

635
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,800
I wanted to pass
this position to Elder Luo.

636
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,080
Brother Liu, why did you stop me?

637
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,400
If I didn’t stop you,

638
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,039
I’d have to see you
bang your head on the wall,

639
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,999
put a Loveless Curse on yourself
and pretend to be the Star of Mosha

640
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,439
until you’re half-dead.

641
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,799
Now, I even have to see you
pass all your duties to someone

642
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,759
and find a place to die alone.

643
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,000
Isn’t that what you’re
thinking, Little Phoenix?

644
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,880
The power of the divine weapons
is raging within me.

645
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,839
I don’t know how long I can last.

646
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,599
So, you’re worried that you might
succumb to the divine weapons’ power,

647
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,039
and the power would
render you into pieces.

648
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,679
Even when you die, the divine weapons
may fall into the wrong hands

649
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,879
and cause the soul of
Star of Mosha to be released.

650
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,799
By then, Xuan Ji will become
Asura zombie herself.

651
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,159
That’s why you have
to stay away from Xuan Ji

652
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,680
even when you die, right?

653
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,320
Don’t worry, Brother Liu.

654
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,560
I’ve never thought about

655
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,000
giving up on myself and die.

656
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
Wu Zhi Qi told me that

657
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,280
there’s the Glacial Pool

658
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,200
that can suppress the power
of the divine weapons.

659
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,519
I’m planning to stay there.

660
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
Really?

661
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,999
So, you and Xuan Ji...

662
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I’m tired.

663
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,160
I have been too obsessed.

664
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,120
I thought we could end well,

665
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,320
but the answer has already
been written in history.

666
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,679
Not having an ending
is an ending in itself.

667
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,880
You’re completely discouraged.

668
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,239
Are you letting go for good?

669
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,000
Perhaps I should have known

670
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,891
that these matters

671
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,994
can never be forced.
