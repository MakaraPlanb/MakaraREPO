00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,319
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,540
<i>EPISODE 16</i>

3
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,300
Xuan Ji, did you remove my mask?

4
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,272
Yes.

5
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,119
If the person you love
only has eyes for you,

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,599
the person will be able to
remove the mask.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,100
And the mask will
turn into a smiling mask.

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,820
What’s going on?

9
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,037
The Mark of Green Feather
hasn’t disappeared.

10
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:19,218
And I still have
the Loveless Curse within me.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,380
Si Feng, what’s wrong?

12
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:23,041
Do you feel uncomfortable?

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,103
It’s nothing.

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,272
Don’t worry.

15
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,839
The mask has been removed.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,533
It’s not important whether
it’s smiling or not.

17
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,022
What’s more important now is
that we should leave this place.

18
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,517
Let’s go.

19
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,618
Let’s go and see the staff
you talked about.

20
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,279
I...

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,039
Let’s go. Why are you standing there?

22
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,534
Let’s go.

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,785
Si Feng, it’s this staff.

24
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:18,173
When I touched it last time,
it struck me with lightning.

25
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,518
This barrier is formed according
to the Eight Trigrams.

26
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,004
I think the staff is
the eye of the formation.

27
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:48,665
I’ll see if I can break the formation
from the top.

28
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:16,375
Si Feng!

29
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,876
Si Feng, are you okay?

30
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,440
Let go of Si Feng!

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,319
Si Feng!

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,823
Si Feng!

33
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
Xuan Ji, don’t go over there!

34
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,940
Si Feng, I want to save you!

35
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,346
Si Feng!

36
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,814
Si Feng!

37
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,180
Xuan Ji, let go of it!

38
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,260
Such impudence!
You never learn your lesson!

39
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,940
Xuan Ji!

40
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,119
I’m not in the wrong!

41
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,599
What did I do wrong?

42
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,284
You were in the wrong!

43
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,705
It’s you!

44
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,540
Dingkun Sword!

45
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,548
Dingkun Sword!

46
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,127
Si Feng.

47
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,460
The barrier surrounding
Dingkun Sword is broken.

48
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,256
God of War,

49
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,937
I’ve finally found you.

50
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,879
Xuan Ji.

51
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,400
Xuan Ji!

52
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,967
Si Feng?

53
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,980
- Why are you hurt?
- I’m fine.

54
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,860
What just happened?

55
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,580
What happened?

56
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,599
The earth was trembling just now.

57
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,340
This is not a staff. It’s a divine sword.

58
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,500
I saw the general calling its name

59
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:41,639
within the Mirror of Origin.

60
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,178
Its name was

61
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,982
Dingkun Sword.

62
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,484
What’s going on?

63
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Seems like the barrier was
used to seal away the sword.

64
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,159
But you broke the seal by accident.

65
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,860
And you became
the owner of the divine sword.

66
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,508
The sword is immensely powerful.

67
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,329
Seems like it doesn’t
belong to the human realm.

68
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,599
Maybe it’s connected
to you somehow.

69
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,387
Every time when I obtain
a shard of the Mirror of Origin,

70
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,239
I’ll see a vision of
a general dressed in armour.

71
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,420
But this time, when I held
the sword in my hand,

72
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,866
I saw her face clearly.

73
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,727
She looked just like me.

74
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,885
I always thought this was only a dream.

75
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:38,106
But now, it seems different
from what I expected.

76
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:43,479
I feel familiar holding
the sword in my hand.

77
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,271
And, I felt like her experiences
were my own experiences.

78
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,057
It seems that she suffered injustice.

79
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,011
Si Feng, what exactly is going on?

80
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,839
Who’s that general?

81
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,369
Why does she look just like me?

82
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,228
And why does she keep
appearing in my mind?

83
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,089
I don’t know what’s going on.

84
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,396
Xuan Ji, don’t be afraid.

85
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,453
No matter what happens,
you’ll always be Chu Xuan Ji.

86
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,884
But,

87
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,600
Ting Nu said

88
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,293
I am me, yet I am not.

89
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,859
Who exactly am I?

90
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,247
Since the Mirror of
Origin shows all origins,

91
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:41,199
maybe those visions
were you in your past life.

92
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,635
Maybe

93
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,399
your lack of six senses have something
to do with your past life as well.

94
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,429
Xuan Ji, don’t worry.

95
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,305
Everything will be explained
once we collect all the shards.

96
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,356
Believe me.

97
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,015
Si Feng!

98
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,728
Si Feng!

99
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,102
Si Feng!

100
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,452
Si Feng?

101
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,306
Where’s your mask?

102
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,167
It came down by chance.

103
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,900
Congratulations.

104
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,561
So, we have to congratulate someone
when their mask is removed?

105
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,244
Ruo Yu, I need to
congratulate you as well.

106
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,577
My mask is different from Si Feng’s.

107
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,441
- Si Feng is...
- This is not the time.

108
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,102
We need to leave.

109
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,324
Xuan Ji, go and check if
there are any demons around here.

110
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,839
We’ll travel to Fuyu Island later.

111
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,558
- Okay.
- Be careful.

112
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,950
Si Feng, I lost my mask.

113
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:12,759
I need to return to Lize Palace
and receive my punishment.

114
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,017
I’m afraid I can’t accompany
you anymore.

115
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:17,719
It’s lucky that
your mask wasn’t destroyed.

116
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,028
You just lost it.

117
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,319
And you don’t have a person you fancy.

118
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,921
If you return and apologise,

119
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:25,062
maybe you’ll be able to avoid
the 13 Punishments.

120
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,636
Take care.

121
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,167
Master.

122
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:35,372
Silver Snake, I need you
to do something for me.

123
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,589
You’re not a human.

124
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,347
You can sneak into Sky Hall and
find out about the location of the shards.

125
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,124
You mustn’t act rashly
if you find out anything.

126
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,959
Just return and report to me.

127
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,119
Master, are you still trying to help
Chu Xuan Ji find the Mirror of Origin?

128
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,592
I’m not going. I’m your spirit beast.

129
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,079
I’ll follow you wherever you go.

130
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,831
Besides, you may
hide the truth from others,

131
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,309
but you can’t hide it from me.

132
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,999
Master, Chu Xuan Ji removed your mask,
but she didn’t dispel the curse.

133
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,799
What’s going on?

134
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,820
This won’t happen if
she has you in her heart.

135
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,999
I don’t know what went wrong,

136
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,799
but the Loveless Curse hasn’t
acted up yet. No need to fear.

137
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,359
Why are you lying to yourself?

138
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,291
If she hurts your heart,
the Loveless Curse will trigger.

139
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:23,959
When the feather mark from your wrist
disappears and travels to your chest,

140
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,399
it’ll be too late by then.

141
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,759
- Master!
- Why are you cursing me?

142
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,999
I’m your master.
If I die, you’ll be homeless.

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,679
- Master...
- Don’t worry.

144
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,719
This is my body. I know my body the best.

145
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,352
And I think this has something to do
with her lack of six senses.

146
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:42,025
I asked you to find the shards
because of my own interest.

147
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,719
I have no choice. She’s the one
who put the curse on you.

148
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
Master, if she dares to hurt you,

149
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,999
- I won’t forgive her.
- Silver Snake,

150
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,820
I don’t like the way you speak.

151
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,807
Fine.

152
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,559
I’ll go.

153
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,939
Be careful.

154
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,180
Greetings, King Bailing.

155
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,420
Didn’t I ask you not to
look for me in the human realm?

156
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:27,119
Did something happen
in the heavenly realm?

157
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,559
It’s not that.

158
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,413
A moment in the heavenly realm
is a few decades in the human realm.

159
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,061
About your visit to the human realm,

160
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:37,999
no one in the heavenly realm
knows about it yet.

161
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,980
Of course, it’s because
I was great at hiding things.

162
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,740
Why are you here then?

163
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,999
My king, I’m writing this book
called "Tales of the Three Realms".

164
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,894
But I had obtained no new materials
ever since you came down here.

165
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,159
I’ve put it aside for decades.

166
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,980
But today, there are
some changes happening.

167
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,835
I’m here to ask about
your thoughts on them.

168
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,376
So that my story
would be more interesting.

169
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,630
What changes?

170
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,797
I forgot that you can’t use your power
once you’re in the human realm.

171
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,290
That’s why you’re in the dark.

172
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,079
She... She escaped
your grasp again.

173
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,180
And she managed to unseal
the Dingkun Sword again.

174
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,139
After such a long time, you
managed to find Dingkun Sword again.

175
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,765
Seems like it’s fate.

176
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,180
This is my script.

177
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,961
My king, do you want to read it?

178
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,573
My king, you were the one
who brought up the God of War.

179
00:17:57,574 --> 00:18:00,159
And she became famous
in the heavenly realm.

180
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,748
I was thinking that if you two
became an item,

181
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,879
everyone would be envious.

182
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,296
It’s a pity that both you and her
are too calm and collected.

183
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,930
I was anxious.

184
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:15,088
That’s why I made the decision to
make the story between you and her

185
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:18,260
the most important chapter
in "Tales of the Three Realms".

186
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,927
But before I wrote my story,

187
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,388
the God of War was punished
and sent to the human realm.

188
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,517
You’re awake?

189
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,439
Who are you?

190
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,799
I’m King Bailing.

191
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,329
Who am I?

192
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,352
You’re my God of War.

193
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,619
I saved you.

194
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,520
I gave you life.

195
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:12,431
Your entire life belongs to me.

196
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,692
You will fight for the heavenly realm.

197
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,919
God of War!

198
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:02,799
God of War!

199
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,199
God of War!

200
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,639
God of War!

201
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:23,119
God of War!

202
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,786
I won.

203
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,119
I told you before.

204
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,599
I trust you the most.

205
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:46,860
God of War!

206
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,580
My king!

207
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,069
God of War?

208
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,608
God of War?

209
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,641
I’m too late.

210
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,399
I’ve been guarding the
Dingkun Sword for 1,000 years.

211
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,699
Yet she just took it away just like that.

212
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,759
She didn’t even stay here
to fight with me.

213
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,278
She’s despicable! This won’t do.

214
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,762
I need to find her.

215
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,783
I need to fight her to my heart’s content.

216
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,885
Who are you?

217
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,922
This stench is so familiar.

218
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,952
Green Dragon, let me go.
I have business to attend to.

219
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,753
Someone removed the Dingkun Sword
used by God of War.

220
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:45,260
Green Dragon,
let’s talk over this.

221
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,886
Guarding the Dingkun Sword
is my responsibility.

222
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,039
I need to retrieve it.

223
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,481
No need for that.

224
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:53,319
King Bailing has a message for you.

225
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,942
No one is to ever ask about or
involve themselves with the God of War.

226
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,493
You don’t have to go.

227
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:00,799
But why?

228
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,999
How dare you question
King Bailing’s order?

229
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,359
Green Dragon, let go of me.

230
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,949
You!

231
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,439
That was close.

232
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,235
It’s lucky that you marked yourself
with the Mark of Concealment.

233
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,759
Even immortals can’t see you.

234
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,340
If not, trouble would arise
if that Flying Snake saw you.

235
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,530
I’ve expected
Flying Snake to create trouble.

236
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,591
That’s why I locked him up.

237
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,371
I didn’t expect him to
sneak to the human realm.

238
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:34,639
That’s right.

239
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,959
Flying Snake doesn’t even know
the God of War.

240
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,719
But he’s stubborn in pursuing
the God of War.

241
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,902
Does he think he can pursue
the God of War?

242
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,801
Does he think he’s you?

243
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,294
He’s overestimating himself.

244
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,595
I didn’t come down to pursue her.

245
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,376
I’m here for the three realms.

246
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,319
The king descended into
the human realm for the God of War.

247
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,940
If you write nonsense like that,
I’ll burn your book.

248
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,929
I mean for the three realms.

249
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,994
My king, it’s a pity.
You’ve done so much just to come here.

250
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:10,278
But the God of War still
managed to retrieve Dingkun Sword.

251
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,174
Dingkun Sword is an evil sword.

252
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:16,428
The God of War had slain
countless demons using it.

253
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,956
It’s filled with anguish.

254
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,576
Seems like your wish
will not be granted again.

255
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,508
My king, God of War will
face another trial today.

256
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,100
So what?

257
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:40,648
She has failed the previous nine trials.

258
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,269
Today is the tenth trial.

259
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:46,964
If she fails again, she’ll never
return to the heavenly realm.

260
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,364
I’ve received another news as well.

261
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:52,949
Some demons are trying to
locate the God of War.

262
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,733
You failed every trial you had faced.

263
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,594
Why can’t you just get over yourself?

264
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,774
My king, you’re the ruler of our realm.

265
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,156
How could you ignore everything
and descend into the human realm?

266
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:10,000
If I ignore the God of War any
longer, she’ll become a demon.

267
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,401
I knew it.

268
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:14,321
My king, you cherish her so much.
It’s impossible for you to ignore her.

269
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,589
You still have her in your heart.

270
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,559
This is too touching.

271
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,398
No, I must write this down in my book.

272
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,558
I’m not concerned about her.

273
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,061
I’m just concerned about the three realms.

274
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,444
As long as her hatred doesn’t overflow

275
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,450
and she leads her life in peace,

276
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:35,831
the three realms will be saved
from another disaster.

277
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:39,132
And I can guide her
to become an immortal again.

278
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,839
So that she can return here.

279
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,192
But, my king,

280
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,896
this...

281
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:46,293
Immortals mustn’t interfere
with human affairs.

282
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:49,699
If you descend into the human realm,
Jade Emperor will find out.

283
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,538
And he’ll blame you.

284
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:54,947
That’s why I’m here
at the Altar of Banishment.

285
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,693
To hide your tracks,

286
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,634
you’re skipping the Path of Reincarnation.
You’re trying to become a human by force.

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,850
My king, you’re the ruler
of the heavenly realm!

288
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,626
You’ll be punished by Nature’s law
if you do so.

289
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:10,613
Not only will you suffer tremendous pain,

290
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:12,775
you can’t use any of your powers as well.

291
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:15,919
And it’ll be hard for you
to practise any spells as a human.

292
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,678
How are you going to protect yourself?

293
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,056
I don’t care even if I have to
use ten years in the human realm

294
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:24,837
to change her destiny.

295
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,841
If I want to do
it, I will do it.

296
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:33,259
My king.

297
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,799
My king!

298
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,171
My king!

299
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,367
Your skills have improved tremendously.

300
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:46,108
I’m very relieved.

301
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:50,868
Master, it’s all thanks to your guidance.

302
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,599
If you didn’t help me when
I was seriously injured

303
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,797
and take me as your disciple, I
wouldn’t have accomplished this.

304
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,199
I told you before.

305
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,540
If I want to do
it, I will do it.

306
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,327
No matter what happens, I’ll lead
her back to the heavenly realm.

307
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:13,034
My lady, how’s it going?

308
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,462
Let me out.

309
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,934
Let me out.

310
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,491
You can’t stand it anymore?

311
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:24,309
I told you before.

312
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,081
There are many things
scarier than death itself.

313
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:29,999
Now, you can only choose
the path I gave you.

314
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,900
You can either stay here and suffer,

315
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:37,013
or kneel down and beg me.

316
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,552
In your dreams.

317
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,016
Great.

318
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,479
I knew it.

319
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,399
You’re more interesting than the others.

320
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,749
You’ve been trying to go against me
ever since we met.

321
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,930
And you tried to offend me
in every way possible.

322
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:00,069
I knew you were different from them.

323
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:05,417
Of course you won’t submit.

324
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:09,038
The young lady from Shaoyang Sect
is precious and proud, right?

325
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,521
I still have many things waiting for you.

326
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,893
I will definitely kill you.

327
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,392
What did you say?

328
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Say it louder.

329
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:30,455
I will definitely kill you.

330
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:32,369
I will definitely kill you!

331
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,683
Let go!

332
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,204
You lunatic!

333
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,265
How dare you bite me
when you’re in this situation!

334
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:43,982
I’m liking you more and more.

335
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,839
Don’t touch me! I’m going to search
for Dingkun Sword.

336
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
- I promise I won’t do anything else.
- You’re just trying to fight!

337
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,860
Stop fooling around! Stay put.

338
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,191
Old Guy?

339
00:29:00,645 --> 00:29:01,884
Old Guy.

340
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:03,419
You’re acting weird.

341
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,159
Lord Flying Snake, I saw you two
fighting just now.

342
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,999
I wanted to stop the fight,
but you know I’m timid.

343
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,644
My skills are limited
and I’m afraid to take a beating.

344
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,551
That’s why I didn’t go and help.

345
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,628
- My lord!
- Stop it.

346
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,606
What is this?

347
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,026
It’s...

348
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,896
Tales of the Three Realms, Lord
Snake and his beloved Phoenix.

349
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,437
My lord, you should return it to me.

350
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,999
What is this?

351
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,321
He, Flying Snake,

352
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,389
is the handsome king of fighter
in the heavenly realm.

353
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,074
A fateful encounter has reduced
his tough demeanour into gentleness.

354
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,479
And he was willing to ignore
everything else.

355
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,751
He, Green Dragon, is
the charming immortal.

356
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,439
A fateful encounter

357
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,359
has caused him to have difficulties
choosing between love and friendship.

358
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,234
It’s all because of Ling Qin
of the phoenix tribe.

359
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,015
She was elegant and gorgeous.

360
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,644
She was a true beauty.

361
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:13,912
Hold it right there.

362
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,112
Why do I feel disgusted?

363
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:20,399
The handsome king of
fighter, I’m sure that’s me.

364
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,959
Yes.

365
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,340
The charming immortal,

366
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,860
are you talking about him?

367
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:30,673
But who’s Ling Qin?

368
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,599
Ling Qin inherits her skill
from Lord Xuan Huo.

369
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,727
She’s a relative of Lord Phoenix.

370
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:41,119
She’s young and talented.

371
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,593
She became the leader of 28 stars
when she first ascended to this realm.

372
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,159
She’s amazing.

373
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,180
I heard of her before.

374
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,052
But I heard that she stays
in the Southern Star Palace

375
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,167
and she rarely goes out.

376
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:59,588
How is she connected to us?

377
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,940
Lord Flying Snake,

378
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,052
seems like you were too busy
to remember this.

379
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:10,555
Don’t you remember?
You saved a sparrow once.

380
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:12,084
That sparrow is Ling Qin.

381
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,838
She couldn’t forget you.

382
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,639
But Lord Green Dragon couldn’t forget her.

383
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,585
Please don’t think that my stories
were all made up. I have evidences.

384
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,667
Just now, it seemed like you two
fought for no reason.

385
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:27,046
But in reality, it’s because of love.

386
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,799
Wait.

387
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,999
You’re saying it’s a one-sided love on
my part, and I even lost to Flying Snake?

388
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,340
- No.
- Change it!

389
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:37,631
My lord!

390
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,734
Si Ming, I think your
story was well-written.

391
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,759
Keep up the good work.

392
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,184
Sure.

393
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,567
Pian Pian, Yu Ning, please
plead with Master on my behalf.

394
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,844
We did nothing wrong.
We don’t know what’s going on.

395
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:02,305
But why is he chasing us off the island?

396
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,844
Senior, calm down.

397
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:07,025
We’ll try to understand
the reason behind his rage.

398
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:09,560
And we’ll plead with him after that.

399
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,042
Thank you.

400
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,439
Everyone, calm down.
We should return for now.

401
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,380
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

402
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,278
I’m Yu Si Feng.

403
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,559
This is Chu Xuan Ji from Shaoyang Sect.

404
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,145
We need to meet Lord Dong Fang.

405
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,253
Please notify him for us.

406
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:38,959
I’m Pian Pian.

407
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,319
This is Yu Ning.

408
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,959
If you two want to enter the island,
you two can follow us.

409
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,492
Please.

410
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,552
Senior Hao Chen.

411
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,539
I didn’t write my reflections lately.

412
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,958
Please don’t be angry.

413
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,359
But I have good news.

414
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,749
I have mended my relationship
with Si Feng.

415
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:02,959
I think that is the most exciting news.

416
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,801
Si Feng changed his plans
and followed us on our journey.

417
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:09,679
Si Feng’s skills have
improved tremendously.

418
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,213
He knows a lot as well.

419
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:13,999
It’s lucky that he’s with us
on our adventures.

420
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,919
Senior, you don’t need to worry.

421
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,349
I forgot to tell you this. Min Yan
and Ling Long had patched up as well.

422
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,669
They like each other.

423
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,092
It’s not me.

424
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:25,877
I made a huge joke out of myself.

425
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,337
It’s lucky that Si Feng was around.

426
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,157
I managed to understand
these things under his help.

427
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,081
Si Feng is amazing.

428
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:34,382
He helped us a lot on our journey.

429
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,374
Yu Si Feng.

430
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,776
Senior Hao Chen, this is
the most important news.

431
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,779
Please pass this message to Father.

432
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,979
We suspect that Xuanyuan Sect
was harmed by the Sky Hall.

433
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,469
Sect Leader Zhu Shi handed
the Destiny Pearl to me.

434
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,711
After that, we were ambushed by them
and got separated.

435
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:15,416
Si Feng and I are trying to
enter Fuyu Island right now.

436
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,676
Ling Long and Sixth Senior
should be on the island now.

437
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,345
Before Sect Leader Ling Shi passed away,

438
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:34,254
he said the Sky Hall
had taken control of Xuanyuan Sect.

439
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,063
Wu Tong said that as well.

440
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,793
But we haven’t confirmed that
for ourselves.

441
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,081
That explains it.

442
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:42,537
Although the Xuanyuan Sect
is getting weaker and weaker,

443
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,248
it is still one of the Five Great Sects.

444
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,839
There’s no way Sky Hall can destroy
a sect like that without alerting others.

445
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,500
I think Sect Leader Ling Shi
must’ve consumed too much demon pills

446
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,841
for him to utter something like that.

447
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,000
I know our words have no weight.
You may not believe in us,

448
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:01,613
but Sect Leader wouldn’t have
given us the Destiny Pearl

449
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:05,719
if he had a choice.

450
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,333
The Destiny Pearl?

451
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,247
Uncle Dong Fang, this is the Destiny Pearl
Sect Leader Zhu Shi gave me.

452
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,702
It is the Destiny Pearl indeed.

453
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,740
This is the sacred item of Xuanyuan Sect.

454
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:44,039
Seems like we need to investigate this.

455
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,063
Xuan Ji, can I hold on
to the Destiny Pearl for now?

456
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,282
Of course you can, Uncle Dong Fang.

457
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:54,879
The Sky Hall wanted this pearl
because of the spirit key.

458
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,939
They want to revive the Star of Mosha.

459
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,479
Star of Mosha?

460
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,264
I don’t know what it is either.

461
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:05,100
But I heard that it has the power
to dominate the three realms.

462
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,372
Dominate the three realms?

463
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:10,153
What a joke.

464
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,708
The Star of Mosha was vanquished
1,000 years ago.

465
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,981
How could they revive it?

466
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:18,992
If they could revive the Star of Mosha,

467
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:21,030
I could revive the immortal, Pan Gu.

468
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,759
My lord, the Sky Hall is
harbouring such ambition indeed.

469
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,802
And they’re trying to execute
their plans now.

470
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,559
Xuanyuan Sect is just a start.

471
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,799
I’m afraid they would
go after Lize Palace,

472
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,359
Dianjinggu Sect, Shaoyang
Sect, or even Fuyu Island.

473
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,199
They can come then!
I’m not afraid of them!

474
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,839
Relay my orders!
Activate the Sword Formation!

475
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,919
I want to see if the demons
can penetrate my formation!

476
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,199
My lord,

477
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,679
Madam’s birthday will arrive soon.
All the other sects will be here as well.

478
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,591
If we activate the formation,
everyone will panic.

479
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:56,008
Moreover, we still need to
investigate the Xuanyuan Sect.

480
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,220
Just activate the formation! No excuses!

481
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,839
How dare the Sky Hall
try to create trouble!

482
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,679
I’ll vanquish all of them!

483
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,199
- Uncle Dong Fang, wait...
- What?

484
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,049
Youngsters have no right
to interfere with this!

485
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,696
It’s late now.

486
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,157
Ask someone to clean up their rooms
and bring them to rest.

487
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,559
Uncle Dong Fang, can you
ask someone to escort us off the island?

488
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,713
- I’ll look for Ling Long and Sixth Senior.
- Of course not!

489
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,039
The Sky Hall is looking for you.

490
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,239
It’s not safe for you outside!

491
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,607
Xuan Ji, it’s fine.

492
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:32,057
Don’t worry. I’ll send someone
to Mount Gao

493
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:33,999
in order to find Ling Long and Min Yan.

494
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,215
- But I want to go there...
- Such impudence!

495
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:39,185
I have the same rank as your father!
How dare you disobey me!

496
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:43,615
I can’t bear the responsibility if
something happens to you, you know?

497
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,871
I’m sorry. I’m tired.

498
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:58,309
You should rest now.

499
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,930
I’ll set up a feast for you tonight.

500
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,656
Xuan Ji, you don’t need to worry.

501
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,602
We will find Ling Long and Min Yan.

502
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:08,569
Go now.

503
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,797
The houses here are empty.

504
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:30,318
They’re fully-furnished as well.

505
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:32,359
Just pick a house you like.

506
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,460
Just tell me if you need anything else.

507
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,918
My master
is not acting like his usual self.

508
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,919
You must’ve been shocked.

509
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,200
It’s fine.

510
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:45,586
Did Lord Dong Fang go somewhere
or encounter something strange?

511
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,768
It’s been half a year since
my master left the island.

512
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,301
Besides his normal training,

513
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:52,087
he’ll accompany his wife
and do some gardening.

514
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,868
There’s nothing strange going on.

515
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,860
So, Madam Dong Fang is responsible
for the beautiful scenery on this island.

516
00:38:57,861 --> 00:38:59,401
It’s such a wonder.

517
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,399
Where does she come from?

518
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,828
She came from Mount Zitong.

519
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,516
After that, my master...

520
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,549
My master has activated the Sword Trap.

521
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,897
You need his permission
if you want to leave the island.

522
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,838
So that you wouldn’t be hurt by the trap.

523
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,505
Si Feng, Uncle Dong Fang
was acting strange.

524
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:29,473
I can’t get through him at all.

525
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:33,093
We can’t find Ling Long and Sixth Senior
since he has locked us in.

526
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,530
Calm down.

527
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,817
Lord Dong Fang has sent someone
to search for them.

528
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:38,799
Ling Long and Min Yan are chivalrous.

529
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,660
Maybe they were delayed because
they were helping others out.

530
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,441
But Lord Dong Fang is strangely anxious.

531
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:48,799
Something’s wrong.

532
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,293
Seems like he was bewitched.

533
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,989
- Bewitched?
- I’m not too sure either.

534
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,497
But there are red rashes on his arm.

535
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,838
And it gives out a sweet scent.

536
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,199
Those were the same symptoms
I saw in someone who was bewitched.

537
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,740
Regarding the truth, we’ll
find out in the feast tonight.

538
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,112
He activated the Sword Formation.

539
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:43,996
Everyone is panicking.

540
00:40:43,997 --> 00:40:46,197
Just forget about all the joyous occasion.

541
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:50,031
Steward Ouyang, our
lord is acting strange lately.

542
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,759
What do you think?

543
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,522
I’m just a steward.

544
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:58,072
It’s better for me
not to ask questions like these.

545
00:40:58,073 --> 00:41:01,198
But it’s good for us
to act more cautiously.

546
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,607
It’s hard to say. Maybe Sky Hall
would invade the island.

547
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:11,232
If they dare to come, they
will die under the Sword Trap.

548
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,919
Today, you two get to try
the special Flower Wine in Fuyu Island.

549
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,420
They’re freshly brewed.
It’s the best time to try them.

550
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,758
Go and find out where Madam is.

551
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,134
Yes.

552
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,239
How’s the taste?

553
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,343
It’s fragrant and sweet.

554
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:33,719
It’s delicious.

555
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,042
Youngsters have no worries indeed.

556
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,844
That’s why you can taste the wine.

557
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:42,985
If we have too many troubles on our mind,

558
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,065
we can’t taste the wine.

559
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,199
My lord, I’m impressed.
You’re an expert in wine tasting.

560
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,715
I brought some special wine
from Lize Palace as well.

561
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:54,279
My lord, please try it.

562
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,801
Bring it to me.

563
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,940
Why doesn’t it taste like wine?

564
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,420
It tastes like water.

565
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,780
- Because...
- Seems like I’m late.

566
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,015
Dear!

567
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,759
<i>QIYU HALL</i>

568
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,210
My dear, you’re here.

569
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,696
- My dear.
- Greetings, Madam.

570
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,731
Is she the daughter of Sect Leader Chu?

571
00:42:41,732 --> 00:42:43,039
Yes.

572
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,820
She’s such a beauty now.

573
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,038
So, he’s the favourite
disciple of Lize Palace?

574
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,959
It’s rare for me to see a disciple
of Lize Palace without his mask.

575
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,599
This is very rare indeed.

576
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,959
Qing Rong, did you drink again?

577
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,398
What? Can’t I drink?

578
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,679
Of course you can.

579
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,386
Did you drink by yourself
or did you drink with someone else?

580
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,385
Why should I tell you?

581
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:09,881
Come, my dear.

582
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,140
What wine is this?

583
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,039
This is the wine Hero Yu
brought from Lize Palace.

584
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,551
Why don’t you try it?

585
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,627
How’s the taste?

586
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,220
Although it’s bland,
it has a delicate scent.

587
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:45,007
It’s much better than the wine
in Fuyu Island.

588
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,820
Good! You can drink more if you like it.

589
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,629
I heard that Xuanyuan Sect was in trouble.

590
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,432
Although Xuanyuan Sect
is one of the Five Great Sects,

591
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:02,196
it’s corrupted inside.

592
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:05,980
They deserved everything.

593
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,442
Qing Rong, that’s enough.
You should drink less.

594
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:15,632
It’s not suitable for
you to say that, right?

595
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,437
Xuan Ji, Hero Yu,

596
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:21,334
don’t just sit over there.
Enjoy the food and wine as well.
