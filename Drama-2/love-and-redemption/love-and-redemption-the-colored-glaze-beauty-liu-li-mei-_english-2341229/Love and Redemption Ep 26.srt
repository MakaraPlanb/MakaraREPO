00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,247
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:32,516
<i>EPISODE 26</i>

3
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:38,533
After that, Wu Zhi Qi locked
me in that grape garden.

4
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,024
He kept playing tricks on me.

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,518
And I tried to escape every day.

6
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,931
But I always failed.

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,559
So, it became a routine.

8
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,350
I would run and
he would catch me.

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,360
Then, we unknowingly spent
a few hundred years together.

10
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:31,759
Pretty lady, how old are you?

11
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,318
Do you have a husband?

12
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,919
That macaque is good in everything.

13
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,239
But he has a bad habit.

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,559
- How about a drink together?
- He loves pretty ladies.

15
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,079
- I have everything.
- He always

16
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,810
- left me behind for a pretty lady.
- I have drinks and food.

17
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,439
Stop washing the clothes.
This is very heavy.

18
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,719
- Let me help you with it.
- Thank you.

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,456
So, I cultivated myself for 500
years to be able to take human form.

20
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,279
I want to let him know that

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,807
the most beautiful lady
is right beside him.

22
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,599
Wu Zhi Qi.

23
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,041
Wake up.

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,285
Wake up and see who I am.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,757
Pretty lady, how old are you?

26
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,479
Do you have a husband?

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,352
What do you mean by pretty lady?

28
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,919
It’s me, the little fox.

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,570
Can’t you recognize me?

30
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,221
Little fox?

31
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,807
You are that little fox?

32
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,602
You really are that little fox.

33
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,015
Where is your fur?

34
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,690
Where’s your tail, little fox?

35
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,399
- You...
- You like pretty ladies, right?

36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,751
So, I turned into a pretty lady.

37
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,562
How is it? Am I beautiful?

38
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,596
You gave me a fright, little fox.

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,395
I...

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,479
You look better before this.

41
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,522
You’re so furry and cute.
And you warm me up when I hug you.

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,297
Can you turn back into a fox?

43
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,370
You stupid monkey, you made me so mad.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,279
Just like that, I spent
500 years with him.

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,277
I finally appeared in front of him
in the form of a beautiful lady.

46
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:54,210
But before I could make that
macaque fall in love with me,

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
he left.

48
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:01,359
Back then, Asura was leading demon clan
to wage war against the heavens.

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,317
He has a friend named Yuan Lang.

50
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:06,053
He invited him to become
the Left Lieutenant of the demon clan.

51
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,429
This macaque is a very loyal friend.

52
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,156
I couldn’t stop him.

53
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,703
He was so impressive back then.

54
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,429
I heard that they were winning.

55
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,639
But suddenly, the Star of Mosha
was killed by the God of War.

56
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,462
And the demon clan was defeated.

57
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:29,389
From then on, the demon clan
was exiled from Mount Buzhou and

58
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,453
they were dispersed into the human realm.

59
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:35,802
And Wu Zhi Qi was captured
by the heavens and is chained

60
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,013
at the bottom of Fenru City under
Mount Buzhou with Dimension Chain.

61
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,272
It has been 1000 years.

62
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:44,964
It is my fault.

63
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:48,616
If only I could
stop him back then.

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,839
So, I have to save him.

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,851
I never thought that you are
a sentimental person.

66
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,959
But Wu Zhi Qi has never
given you any promise.

67
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,153
And you’ve loved him for 1000 years.
Is it worth it?

68
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:07,077
I don’t care if it’s worth it or not.

69
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,684
I love him. So, this is what I want to do.

70
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:12,870
I’m happy with my decision.

71
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:22,599
I think it’s great to be
so decisive in love.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,198
It’s way better than the relationship
between that Lord Dong Fang and

73
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,396
his wife.

74
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,781
Why do you need to hesitate
when you like someone?

75
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,887
As long as I can save Wu Zhi Qi,

76
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,000
I’m willing to do anything.

77
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,150
Si Feng.

78
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:04,245
I never thought that demons can love
as deep and true as this Purple Fox too.

79
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,559
Demons are like humans too.

80
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,610
They are living beings in this world.

81
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,829
And they have real feelings too.

82
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,358
I’ve never thought about it before.

83
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:22,166
I thought that Purple Fox
is just a frivolous demon.

84
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,358
I never thought that she’ll be so loyal.

85
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,449
I even like her a little bit now.

86
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,159
Yes.

87
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,330
She took the Mirror of Origin

88
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,964
because she wanted to relive
the moments between her and Wu Zhi Qi.

89
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,410
I want to look at the female
general in that Mirror of Origin too.

90
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,559
What is her story?

91
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,263
And how is she related to me?

92
00:07:54,926 --> 00:08:00,292
You and your Senior Hao Chen
are already destined to be together.

93
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,245
He has been pursuing you for 1000 years.

94
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:06,455
Maybe the person in the mirror is him.

95
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,639
Si Feng.

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,570
Can I say that you
are acting jealous now?

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,930
You are quite a fast learner for things
that I didn’t teach you.

98
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:24,781
Your father has never
wanted us to be together.

99
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,424
Now that you’ve ran away with me,

100
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,281
he might be

101
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:32,523
putting me on a search warrant tomorrow.

102
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,678
He won’t.

103
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,261
Although my father is
a little bit old-fashioned,

104
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,479
I know that he dotes on me.

105
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,439
As long as it’s not a demon,
he will be able to accept anyone.

106
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,070
Don’t worry, I’ll convince him.

107
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:08,599
Hey, we’ve been walking for so
long. What’s wrong with your nose?

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,884
You couldn’t even smell him.
Can you really find him?

109
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,981
Ting Nu’s smell disappeared
around here last time.

110
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:17,732
It’s the same this time.

111
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,740
You old woman,
don’t play any tricks on us.

112
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:25,061
I’m not playing tricks on you.
Are you dumb?

113
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:27,962
If I can smell him myself,
why do I have to ask for your help?

114
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,930
How can we find Ting Nu then?

115
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,141
Brother Liu has a celestial eye, right?

116
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:42,934
If we can find Brother Liu,
we’ll be able to find Ting Nu.

117
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,394
Yes. We just need to find Brother Liu.

118
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:49,624
Purple Fox, you can’t smell Ting
Nu but, can you smell Brother Liu?

119
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,386
I don’t know him.

120
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:55,037
How do I know how he smells like?

121
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,399
Little Phoenix.

122
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,612
Take this.

123
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,469
Don’t say that I didn’t help you.

124
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,679
I have something that
Brother Liu left for me.

125
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,881
What is it? Show me.

126
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,399
You can’t look at this.

127
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,694
- Why not? Show me.
- No.

128
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:21,919
Why not? I showed you my book last time.
Why can’t you show me yours?

129
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,582
- Show me.
- No means no.

130
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,325
Why not? Show me.

131
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:30,292
Don’t tell me that you are reading
that kind of book.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,959
Nonsense.

133
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,919
What kind of book is that?

134
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,164
Stop it.

135
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,782
Stop fooling around.
We should find Brother Liu now.

136
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,365
Smell this.

137
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,490
Find out where he is.

138
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:48,199
Let’s split up and find him now. Let’s go.

139
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,467
Show me.

140
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,058
Show me. Si Feng!

141
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,642
Don’t tell me that the one
we are looking for is here.

142
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,635
Where does this handsome man come from?

143
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,559
Come, play with me.

144
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,130
It’s painful.

145
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,780
Hurry up and let’s go.

146
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,479
This is Qingyang City.

147
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,339
How do you know that Brother Liu is here?

148
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,959
My nose has never failed me.

149
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,026
Except when someone purposely
covered up the smell like Ting Nu.

150
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,256
We are here.

151
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,879
Let’s go.

152
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,119
Come on.

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,490
Let’s go.

154
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,286
Come on. Come in.

155
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,839
Don’t be shy.
Just treat this like your own home.

156
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,759
Little Phoenix, as the saying
goes, people meet out of fate.

157
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,319
Come, have a seat.

158
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,429
More like out of money, right?

159
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,999
If it wasn’t because we need your help,

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,570
I wouldn’t admit that I know you just now.

161
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,159
You paid for me.
So, you are my master now.

162
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,609
Come, Master. Have a seat.

163
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,577
It’s fine. I want to stand.

164
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,062
Brother Liu, why are you at Qingyang?

165
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,724
Have you found Yu’Er?

166
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,909
Well, Yu’Er?

167
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,933
Half a month ago,
Yu’Er brought me to Sky Hall’s hideout.

168
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,549
She said that she wants to
stay in Sky Hall.

169
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,679
It was chaotic back then,
I couldn’t convince her to leave with me.

170
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,650
I saw her leaving with
the people from Sky Hall.

171
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:06,648
And I didn’t have the chance
to tell you about it.

172
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:14,677
That Yu’Er is really naughty.

173
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,119
How can she spend time
with demons from Sky Hall?

174
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,352
I really can’t do anything about her.
Forget it. I don’t care anymore.

175
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,192
Who is this beautiful lady in purple?

176
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:34,279
God is really treating me well.

177
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,090
I even met this beautiful fox lady
who is 1000 years old.

178
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,930
How is it? Is my hand nice, you scoundrel?

179
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,039
You are indeed an old fox demon.

180
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,541
How dare you say that I’m old.

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,661
We are all friends. Be kind to him.

182
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,399
Brother Liu.

183
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,591
We are here this time
to ask for your help.

184
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,629
I have a friend named Ting Nu.
He went missing.

185
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,519
We couldn’t find him or smell him.

186
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,437
Can you help us find him?

187
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,759
You want to find someone? It’s easy.

188
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,277
Great. Brother Liu,
let’s not waste any time then.

189
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,020
Open your celestial eye now
to help us look for Ting Nu.

190
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:23,869
Now?

191
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,782
At first, it’s not a problem to help you
find him with my celestial eye.

192
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:36,701
But unfortunately, I just opened
my celestial eye two days ago.

193
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:37,959
You know that

194
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,639
if I open the celestial eye again
within such a short time,

195
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,885
it’ll be adverse to my health.

196
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,376
You opened the celestial eye?

197
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:49,024
Then, we won’t be able to save
Ting Nu now.

198
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:53,059
Calm down. Although
I can’t open my celestial eye,

199
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,638
I can still feel a faint trace of him.

200
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,479
How about you stay at my house
for two days first?

201
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,721
I’ll find a way in two days.
There must be a way.

202
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,749
We’ll have to trouble you then.

203
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,552
It’s no trouble.

204
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,651
Yu’Er!

205
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,719
Such a bright young lady.
It’ll be a pity if she dies.

206
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,690
Old Fogey! Save me!
I can’t take it anymore!

207
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,390
Don’t hurt her! Yu’Er!

208
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,858
Don’t touch her.

209
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,863
What do you want?

210
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,244
I need you to do something for me.

211
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:50,291
This is the Mirror of Origin.

212
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,119
Bring this mirror to Chu Xuan Ji.

213
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,582
Let her look into this
mirror to remember her past

214
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,574
so that she can awaken
her God of War’s power.

215
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,776
Xuan Ji?

216
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,758
You want me to
betray my own friend?

217
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,151
Impossible.

218
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,533
Fine.

219
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,422
Yu’Er!

220
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,959
Old Fogey, save me!

221
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,639
Fine, I promise you. Stop!

222
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,938
Stop!

223
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,239
You should’ve agreed earlier.

224
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,580
I’m just asking you to jolt her memories,
not to kill her.

225
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,714
Think about it. Our lord wants to
reawaken the God of War.

226
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:45,330
But I heard that God of War was the one
who killed Star of Mosha back then.

227
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,268
Who can win? Our lord or the God of War?

228
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,330
You are a lunatic.

229
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,792
I really don’t know what
Sky Hall is plotting.

230
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,799
Little Phoenix cherishes Xuan Ji so much.

231
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,197
If Little Phoenix and Xuan
Ji are hurt because of me,

232
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,439
it’ll be such an unfaithful thing to do.

233
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,130
I can’t do that.

234
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,621
Just like what the lord has expected.
They’ve asked you to help save the merman.

235
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,612
Now, everything is ready.

236
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:44,150
It’ll be up to you next.

237
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,015
Yu’Er! How’s Yu’Er?

238
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:53,213
Don’t worry. The North Superintendent
knows that you’ll miss your daughter.

239
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,750
So, he sent me to give you this.

240
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,801
After your mission is done,
you’ll be able to see your daughter.

241
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,357
Maybe it’s not a bad thing to reawaken
the God of War’s memories.

242
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,959
She’ll have to know the truth
sooner or later.

243
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,335
I’m sorry, Little Phoenix.

244
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,229
Why aren’t you letting us sleep?

245
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,229
You better have
something important to say.

246
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,680
Of course I have
something important to say.

247
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:28,919
Let me tell you.

248
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,636
I tried everything I can
and used up all of my power

249
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:38,887
to finally be able to feel
where that merman is.

250
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,182
This is the Fire Desert?

251
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:59,685
We can only reach the entrance of
Mount Buzhou through this Fire Desert.

252
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:03,229
But it’ll be hard to fly with sword within
a few miles around Mount Buzhou.

253
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,500
It’s fine. We can just walk there.

254
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,583
Mount Buzhou has a complicated terrain.

255
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,621
A gale will blow through here every night.

256
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,188
We won’t be able to travel in it.

257
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,940
It’s late already.

258
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,342
How about we stay at an inn first?

259
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,583
We can travel first thing
in the morning tomorrow.

260
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,357
Don’t worry, Sect Leader.
Hao Chen already said that

261
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:29,658
the entrance of Mount Buzhou
will only be opened at certain time.

262
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,503
Even if they reach here before us,
they won’t be able to go in now.

263
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,119
Okay.

264
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,690
Let’s find an inn first then.

265
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,519
- Ting Nu is locked up here?
- There’s a demon guarding the door.

266
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,908
It’s fine. Later,
we can climb over the wall.

267
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,483
We can save him without alerting anyone.

268
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:03,581
Wait.

269
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,239
This doesn’t feel right.

270
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,005
What place is this?

271
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,373
We don’t know who our opponents are
or what they want.

272
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:12,549
It’s not wise to just

273
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,734
rush in.

274
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,359
I’ve lived for 1000 years
without fearing anything.

275
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,730
If you are afraid, I can go in myself.

276
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,317
We’ll save Ting Nu for sure.

277
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,670
But we have to be careful.

278
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,470
Be careful then.
Let’s split up and search the place.

279
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:29,690
Let’s go.

280
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,349
- I smell Dang Kang.
- Dang Kang?

281
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,670
What is Dang Kang?

282
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,813
Ting Nu’s spirit beast.

283
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,596
Dang Kang.

284
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,079
Don’t just purr. Tell us something useful.

285
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,213
Where is your master?

286
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,855
Bring us to him.

287
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,319
It said that Ting Nu
is trapped by the demon here.

288
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,148
It just managed to break the barrier
and came out to ask for help.

289
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,601
Come here, little guy.

290
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,386
Si Feng, you can communicate with it?

291
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,038
You can understand it?

292
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,184
I learned some beast language before.

293
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,985
If you want to learn,
I can teach you in the future.

294
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,039
- What did he say?
- He said that

295
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,927
Ting Nu is locked inside a secret room.

296
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:44,355
It wants to bring us to him.

297
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,661
Let’s go.

298
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,365
There are so many rooms here.

299
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:09,176
How long will it take?

300
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,900
We are here to rescue him.
We can’t rush it.

301
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:15,399
We haven’t checked this room, right?
Let’s go in.

302
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,559
Okay.

303
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,820
Let’s go.

304
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,424
This doesn’t look like a place
to hold someone in.

305
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,390
Maybe there’s a mechanism in here.

306
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,881
Let’s look for it.

307
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,759
What is this?

308
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,057
What is this?

309
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,439
They are trying to lock us in.

310
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,008
This is a Restrictive Formation.

311
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,742
We won’t be able to get out now.

312
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,028
This is bad. Si Feng and the others are
in danger. We’ve to find a way to get out.

313
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,079
Mirror of Origin?

314
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,199
What happened to Ting Nu?

315
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,119
Ting Nu’s heart’s blood is used
to build this formation.

316
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,849
This will kill him.

317
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,210
Let’s try to break this formation first.

318
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:07,142
You stupid fox. Why aren’t you here yet?

319
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:40,919
Si Feng.

320
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,541
Are we inside the Mirror of Origin now?

321
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,752
I think so.

322
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,541
Why will we be in the Mirror of Origin?

323
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,912
Where is the Purple Fox?

324
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,849
King Bailing, this is bad!

325
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,799
King Bailing, this is bad!

326
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,820
The life pillar of God of War
is flickering again.

327
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:11,090
I’m afraid that Chu Xuan Ji
has entered the Mirror of Origin.

328
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,799
She just left me for a few days.

329
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,148
But she has already
run into the Mirror of Origin?

330
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:20,778
This is not as simple as it looks.

331
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,887
You are the God of War, right?

332
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,497
She’s the one I keep on
seeing in my dream.

333
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,021
Do you mean that female general?

334
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,046
Xuan Ji.

335
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,029
She looks exactly like you.

336
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,988
She looks like she has a
lot of secrets in her heart.

337
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:48,440
What does she want to tell me?

338
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,429
Where is she now?

339
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,013
No matter it’s about Xuan Ji
or the Mirror of Origin,

340
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,445
this is a matter of the human realm.

341
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:10,599
The heavens can’t interfere with
the matters of human realm.

342
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,211
I can’t find out where she is.

343
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,014
I can’t stay here for long. Goodbye.

344
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,599
Deity Binding Spell?

345
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,127
King Bailing!

346
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:24,590
I used my energy to cast this spell.

347
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,920
If you break this spell forcefully,
you’ll break my spirit.

348
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:32,240
Then, you’ll be committing
a grave crime, Si Ming.

349
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:37,199
Just this once.
Tell me where Xuan Ji is.

350
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,459
Why do you have to do this, King Bailing?

351
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,912
The key memories of the God of War

352
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:44,782
have already been wiped away
by you from her life pillar, right?

353
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,141
Even if she enters the Mirror of Origin,

354
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:50,422
she’ll just see some fragmented memories.

355
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:55,840
Even if she awakens, she won’t
be able to remember the past.

356
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,481
In this life, I can’t
let her be anymore.

357
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,822
King Bailing, everyone
has their own destiny.

358
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:12,245
No matter how much
you want to save God of War,

359
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:14,907
we can’t go against the laws of God.

360
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,319
By the way, it’s considered
prying into the prophecy if mortals

361
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,864
go into the Mirror of Origin.

362
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:28,006
When they do that, there’ll be lightning.

363
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,773
There will be lightning?

364
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,058
Smart.

365
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,999
If you think along this line, you
might be able to find Chu Xuan Ji.

366
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,829
If you can seek her out yourself,
it’ll be by your own effort.

367
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,457
I didn’t say anything.

368
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,790
Go back to Siming Hall at once.

369
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,559
If things go wrong with her life pillar,

370
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,389
seal it up even if you have to
deplete your power to do that.

371
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,400
We can’t let her power awaken yet.

372
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,030
Go now.

373
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,330
If you fail me, I won’t forgive you.

374
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,622
Yes, King Bailing.

375
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:16,899
What place is this?

376
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,309
This is...

377
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,794
Could it be that this is the heavens?

378
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,661
You can fight well, right?
Come, fight me.

379
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:27,159
I don’t want to fight you.

380
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:30,793
Are you afraid of me?
If you can’t even defeat me,

381
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:34,279
how can King Bailing send you
to lead the army against Asura?

382
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,400
You are not stronger or better than I am.

383
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,879
King Bailing’s order.

384
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,305
Nobody is allowed
to disturb the God of War.

385
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:46,796
Don’t mind him.

386
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,821
God of War, I’m here
to issue a military order

387
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,842
on behalf of King Bailing.

388
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,439
Say it.

389
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
King Asura has led his right and
left lieutenants with 12 Dark Knights

390
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,237
to attack the shore of Life and Death Sea.

391
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,292
You are to go into battle at once.

392
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:09,657
King Bailing thinks that this is
our best chance to kill King Asura

393
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:12,097
and defeat the army of the demon clan.

394
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:21,010
King Bailing said that he’ll
await your triumphant return.

395
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,571
After defeating the demon clan’s army,

396
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:28,269
the war will end, right?

397
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,460
After that,

398
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,670
does it mean that
I don’t have to fight anymore?

399
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,209
Well...

400
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:48,856
Let’s go.

401
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,281
Can you stop creating troubles for me?

402
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:04,039
King Asura?

403
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,948
The demon clan’s army?

404
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,045
Could it be that this is

405
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:10,776
the war between the heavens
and demon realm 1000 years ago?

406
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,933
I think so.

407
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:17,318
You can see the past
through the Mirror of Origin.

408
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:20,854
This happened in the heavens
1000 years ago.

409
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,719
I think it’s related to you.

410
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,536
But 1000 years ago,

411
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,782
who is she?

412
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:29,317
They call her the God of War.

413
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,635
Could it be that

414
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:34,044
she’s the legendary God of War
who defeated the demon clan’s army

415
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:36,953
and destroyed King Asura?

416
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,812
Xuan Ji.

417
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,701
She looks like you and
often appears in your dream.

418
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,912
She is

419
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,055
probably you in the past.

420
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,477
Really?

421
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:53,685
In the past, I’m not a devil
who killed without batting an eye

422
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,848
but a God of War from the heavens?

423
00:31:57,502 --> 00:31:59,239
Look.

424
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,805
You always thought
so badly about yourself.

425
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:03,605
Do you understand now?

426
00:32:03,606 --> 00:32:05,430
She’s an outstanding person.

427
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,559
She stayed here?

428
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,171
It’s too cold and desolate.

429
00:32:39,302 --> 00:32:40,919
That is Dingkun Sword.

430
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,130
Yes.

431
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,669
It’s Dingkun Sword.

432
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,937
No wonder you are the
only one who can awaken it.

433
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:57,828
It’s Ting Nu.

434
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:00,645
He told me that he was once
a medic in the heavens.

435
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,943
He was punished and sent down to
the human realm because of something.

436
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,879
God of War.

437
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,117
You haven’t fully recovered yet and
you are leading the battle again?

438
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,637
Do you want me to tell
King Bailing about it

439
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:19,280
so that you can sit out
for this battle this time?

440
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:21,719
My injuries are nothing.

441
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,734
The demon clan’s army
is gathering their forces.

442
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,971
If I don’t go, nobody else can fight them.

443
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,984
No need to worry King Bailing
because of this.

444
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:33,214
The most worrisome thing for a medic is
patient who doesn’t take care of herself.

445
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,998
After this battle,

446
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,510
I’m afraid that you’ll add
new injuries to your old ones

447
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,670
until I won’t be able
to treat your wounds.

448
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,357
I’ll try to get injured less.

449
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:45,095
Don’t worry about me.

450
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:49,965
This is not what I meant.

451
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,290
Take care.

452
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,408
How can the Jade Emperor
break his promise?

453
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,253
You Asuras are cold-blooded killers.

454
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:10,309
Today... Today, I’m going
to kill you just like how

455
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,599
I killed Rahu Ketu.

456
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,730
You are the God of War
of the heavens?

457
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:19,009
You are the one who killed Star of Mosha?

458
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,637
This is such a joke.

459
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,359
What’s wrong?

460
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,999
What does King Asura mean?

461
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,554
Why can’t I see anything?
What does he mean by such a joke?

462
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:35,150
Calm down, Xuan Ji.

463
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,884
Let’s go through the fog.

464
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,422
God of War.

465
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:44,922
You are so vicious.

466
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:58,999
What’s wrong?

467
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,717
The mirror already let us in.

468
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:02,857
Why won’t it show us the rest?

469
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,623
This is indeed strange.
As if something has covered it up.

470
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,079
Why did you lie to me?

471
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,575
Why?

472
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,359
- I’m just sword for you to kill with!
- Xuan Ji.

473
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,910
- Why did you do this to me?
- What’s wrong?

474
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,688
Why do I feel so upset
when I hear her voice?

475
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,230
In the past, I thought that
we are two entities.

476
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,159
She and I are different.

477
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,765
But now, I can clearly feel
her anger and helplessness.

478
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,079
But I don’t know what happened.

479
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,824
Why can’t I see anything?

480
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:33,879
When I read an ancient scroll
regarding the Mirror of Origin,

481
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,228
someone mentioned that
if a person’s past is sealed,

482
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:39,021
it’ll affect the Mirror of Origin.

483
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:42,069
Looks like your past has been sealed up.

484
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,359
That’s why you can
only see fragments of it.

485
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,158
It has been 1000 years.

486
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,956
Why do they still want to seal it?

487
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:51,262
Why? Why does the heavens
want to wipe away my pass?

488
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:52,799
Xuan Ji!

489
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,287
Don’t be obsessed with it. You might
get lost within these memory fragments.

490
00:35:57,062 --> 00:36:02,661
Wu Zhi Qi, how dare you stole
the Yuntian Loop and Chehai Hook?

491
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:06,246
God of War,
I want you to arrest Wu Zhi Qi.

492
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,070
I want to eradicate demon clan
from the three realms.

493
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:33,559
Wu Zhi Qi, surrender now.

494
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,655
Return the Yuntian Loop and Chehai Hook
to the heavens.

495
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,639
Do they belong to the heavens?

496
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,359
You killed Star of Mosha
and took away his things.

497
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,570
I’m just getting his things back for him!

498
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,090
God of War, King Asura
asked me to send you a message.

499
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,439
God of War, I was killed by you.

500
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,230
I kept my last breath
to give you a present.

501
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,759
Take a good look at

502
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,957
what secret does King Bailing
hide in his celestial hall.

503
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:27,699
You brought this upon yourself!

504
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,990
Why is it gone again?

505
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,599
What happened?

506
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,690
Why won’t it show me?

507
00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:59,187
Bailing, come out!

508
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,599
Are you trying to revolt?

509
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,930
How long are you going to
keep lying to me?

510
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,719
Bailing looks so familiar.

511
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,254
You lied to me and made
me into this God of War.

512
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,398
I trusted you so much.

513
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,849
How could you

514
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,945
and the whole heavens
use me like this?

515
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,159
How dare you!

516
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,519
God of War, you are disobedient and revolt
against your superior. It’s unforgivable!

517
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,039
What did I do wrong?

518
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,438
You are the one who was wrong.

519
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,079
I want to see the Jade Emperor!

520
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,542
Or else, I’ll destroy the entire heavens.

521
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,919
No matter how courageous you are,

522
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,846
you can’t just charge into celestial hall
and scream at King Bailing!

523
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:57,239
I can guard the heavens.

524
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,519
And I can destroy it.

525
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,294
How dare you! Arrest her!

526
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,877
Bailing!

527
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:13,879
You have to give me an explanation today!

528
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,069
Bailing.

529
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,822
I won’t forgive you.

530
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,559
I will kill you.

531
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,570
I’ll kill all of you
and avenge myself!

532
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,239
Jade Emperor!

533
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,199
Why won’t you come out and talk to me?

534
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,568
Is the heavens full of cowards?

535
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,479
You want to see me?

536
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,934
What did I do wrong?

537
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,243
You are the one who did wrong.

538
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,923
You used me

539
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,201
and turned me into
the heavens’ murder weapon.

540
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:14,239
You used me to kill people
whom I shouldn’t kill.

541
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,919
You made me do something evil and vicious.

542
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,581
And in the end,
I am the one who did wrong?

543
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:20,670
This is not fair.

544
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,767
This is not fair!

545
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,966
Let her go!

546
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,079
You hate me for betraying you
and lying to you.

547
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,582
So, you want to seek revenge
from the heavens?

548
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:37,009
I will uphold justice

549
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,310
even if it’ll cost me my life
or bring me to hell forever.

550
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,279
Please forgive her!

551
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,359
I’ll send you down to the human realm
to go through ten reincarnations

552
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,919
to get rid of your resentment.

553
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,679
As for how it’ll turn out,
it’ll all depend on you.

554
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,879
Why?

555
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,919
Why do I have to be punished?

556
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,269
I didn’t do anything wrong.
Why do I have to be punished?

557
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,639
Why? Why did you
seal up all of my memories?

558
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,765
Why won’t you tell me anything?

559
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,839
Xuan Ji, look at me.

560
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,861
Pull yourself together. You are not
God of War, you are Chu Xuan Ji!

561
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:14,159
They are still waiting for us outside.

562
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,719
Don’t be dragged into it anymore.

563
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,959
I have to get to the bottom of this.

564
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,805
I have to get to the bottom of this!

565
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,908
Xuan Ji!

566
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,200
Xuan Ji?

567
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,944
Why am I here too?

568
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,770
This is the memory of my trial.

569
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,183
Could it be that

570
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,349
Xuan Ji was in a trial with me?

571
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:13,967
It’s done now.

572
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,983
With the injury on your ankle,

573
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:20,065
you shouldn’t have forced yourself
to dance.

574
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:23,981
If you can’t recover well,
I’m afraid that you can’t even

575
00:43:23,982 --> 00:43:25,691
walk properly in the future.

576
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,131
I never thought about the future.

577
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,139
And I don’t believe that
there is sincerity in this world.

578
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,810
I won’t leave with you.

579
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:43,095
I’ll only wait for one person
to come and get me.

580
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:49,399
Lan Yue, Mister Qiao is here to
bring you back to Qiao Residence.

581
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,926
Pack your things.

582
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,044
See?

583
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:56,315
I knew that he would come.

584
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,439
You said that
you don’t believe in sincerity.

585
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,070
But you believe in him.

586
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,848
Do you know

587
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,877
what kind of man Mister Qiao is?

588
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:13,767
I know what kind of a person he is.

589
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:17,060
And I never said that
I’ll trust his sincerity.

590
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:20,286
I don’t trust anybody.

591
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:22,177
I trust only myself.

592
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,822
I remember now.

593
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,038
No.

594
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,413
Xuan Ji.

595
00:44:31,414 --> 00:44:33,060
Don’t go, Xuan Ji!
