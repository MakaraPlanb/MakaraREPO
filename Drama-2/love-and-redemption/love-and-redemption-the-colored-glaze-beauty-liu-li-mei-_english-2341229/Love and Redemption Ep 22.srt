00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,306
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,660
<i>EPISODE 22</i>

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,870
Why are you trying to
locate where the Sky Hall is?

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,950
I know now. It’s because of
Chu Xuan Ji again, am I right?

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,030
Don’t tell me you’re trying to
retrieve Ling Long’s primordial spirit?

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,595
Chu Xuan Ji, she has been
locked up by Shaoyang Sect.

7
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:51,266
Master, it’s useless even if
you risk yourself doing this.

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,577
That’s precisely the case.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,279
I know she’s very worried right now.

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,599
Master, didn’t you say
she is just a friend?

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,393
That Chu Xuan Ji, she fawns over
her Sixth Senior for one moment,

12
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,519
and she’s predestined to be
with her senior in another.

13
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,601
- Master, are you still...
- So what?

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,057
She’s my friend.

15
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:13,848
How could I just
stand still and do nothing?

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,990
Give me the ring you obtained
from Sky Hall.

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,150
South Superintendent sent me here
to save you.

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,079
Save me!

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
- I’m with the North Superintendent!
- I can save you,

20
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,359
but South Superintendent is worried
that you might be bribed by the human.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,199
That’s why you need to answer
three questions to prove your identity.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,199
Ask me then!

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,839
First question, do you know who’s Wu Tong?

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,759
Lord Wu Tong? Of course!

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,279
- He’s the North Superintendent.
- Okay.

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,039
Second question, where
is Wu Tong right now?

27
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,469
Didn’t he return to our headquarters

28
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,336
after the Northern hideout was destroyed?

29
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,607
Didn’t you know that?

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,919
Of course I do.

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,276
I’m just testing you.

32
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,119
Last question, where’s the location
of our headquarters?

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,367
Headquarters? I don’t know that.

34
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:19,657
How could you not know its location?

35
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,599
I just joined our group.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,530
I only heard that our headquarters
isn’t in the human realm.

37
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:26,321
I think it’s in West...

38
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,096
Let me out!

39
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,394
Is anyone there?

40
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,785
Let me out!

41
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,030
Xuan Ji, what are you doing?

42
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,919
Are you trying to disobey
our sect leader now?

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,342
I’ve spent much effort
to seal Dingkun Sword’s power.

44
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,213
But the seal is fading already?

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,869
Senior Hao Chen, Father
may ignore Ling Long, but I won’t.

46
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,115
Xuan Ji, why can’t you
understand the words that I’ve said?

47
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,260
Do you think Sect Leader
doesn’t care about Ling Long?

48
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:52,266
Ling Long is a trivial matter
compared to the lives of all beings.

49
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:56,519
Your father is doing the
right thing as a cultivator!

50
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,799
Xuan Ji, as the guardian
of the secret ground,

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,486
you should understand this as well!

52
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:02,839
I don’t understand!

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,456
Ling Long’s life is a life as well!

54
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,318
Why must we forsake Ling Long?

55
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,119
To me, the lives of all beings
are too vague to me.

56
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,946
Ling Long is the only one
who had accompanied me all along.

57
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,839
I can’t just ignore her!

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,150
Father and the rest may forsake
her, but not me. I must save her.

59
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,359
You’re doing the exact opposite.

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,230
Xuan Ji, do you know you’ll commit
a grave mistake if you continue this?

61
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:31,217
Senior, humans aren’t inanimate
objects. We mustn’t be heartless.

62
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,608
I did nothing wrong!

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,286
I did nothing wrong!

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,879
Xuan Ji has been deeply influenced
by her emotions and feelings.

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,192
I mustn’t let her continue this.

66
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:42,919
Fine.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,414
You can leave.

68
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,161
But you’re not allowed to
chase after Wolf.

69
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:49,159
You’ll follow me back to Shaoyang
and never leave again.

70
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,479
Senior!

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,959
No one will save Ling Long if I do that!

72
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,201
You’ve sworn to be the guardian
of the secret ground.

73
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:58,039
Guarding the secret ground
must always be your priority.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,319
Now, the demons know that Star of Mosha’s
core is located in the secret ground.

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,959
It’s a dire situation.

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,959
As a disciple of Xuyang Peak,
you need to be responsible.

77
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,570
No! I want to save my sister!

78
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,159
Master and the rest should be able to
protect the place. Why should I return?

79
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,593
Such impudence!

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,359
Senior, let me go! Let me save Ling Long!

81
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,511
Xuan Ji, stop being stubborn.

82
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,420
This is what Sect Leader wanted as well.

83
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,853
You can’t take Xuan Ji away.

84
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,478
She doesn’t want to return.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,358
Yu Si Feng,

86
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,755
you’ve interrupted the affairs
of Shaoyang Sect on several occasions.

87
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,893
You’ve instigated her to disobey
the sect leader’s orders.

88
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,081
Don’t you think you’re too much?

89
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,623
Senior Hao Chen.

90
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,894
Don’t you think you’re too heartless?

91
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,721
Now, Ling Long has
lost her primordial spirit.

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,951
And Min Yan is still unconscious.

93
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,142
Xuan Ji will never be satisfied
if you take her away.

94
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,950
Senior Hao Chen, please let her go.

95
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:54,272
You want me to let her go?

96
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,783
It’ll depend on your ability!

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,226
Si Feng!

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,959
Ling Long!

99
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,264
Ling Long!

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,079
Yu Si Feng,

101
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,199
do you think you can
get yourself an unlikely relationship

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,910
by pestering Xuan Ji all the time?

103
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,894
Si Feng! Are you okay?

104
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,439
Si Feng, just ignore me!

105
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,879
Xuan Ji, don’t tell me you’re willing
to return just like this?

106
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,185
I...

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,225
Since you’re not willing to do so,

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,550
I won’t let him take you away.

109
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:11,359
Si Feng!

110
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,835
You’ve suffered internal injuries.

111
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,359
Stop pretending to be strong.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,733
Move away!

113
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,470
No way.

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,982
Yan Ran!

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,990
Stop!

116
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,283
Yan Ran, when did you get here?

117
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,149
Poison?

118
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,788
Why would a disciple of Dianjinggu Sect
use poison?

119
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,249
You’re trying to hurt Si Feng!
What’s wrong with using poison?

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
Xuan Ji.

121
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,870
Aunt Ying Hong? Hurry!

122
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,599
Hao Chen, Min Yan is awake.
He’s in Ling Long’s room now.

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,999
Let Xuan Ji go and visit him.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,119
Senior Hao Chen, I beg you!
Please let me go!

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,792
I want to see how Sixth Senior is doing.

126
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,392
I grew up with Sixth Senior and Ling Long.

127
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,399
I will only be relieved
when both of them are fine.

128
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,988
Senior Hao Chen, I beg you!
Please let me go!

129
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,592
Hao Chen, I’m your senior.

130
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,084
I’ll make the decision for you.

131
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:21,423
Release Xuan Ji right now.

132
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,510
Si Feng, let’s go!

133
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,777
Si Feng!

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,671
You stay here.

135
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,628
Let me go!

136
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,113
Ling Long, I’m Min Yan.

137
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,929
Ling Long, what’s wrong with you?

138
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,854
Look at me!

139
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,642
Ling Long, I’m your Little Six!

140
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,306
What’s wrong with you?

141
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,697
Get up and look at me!

142
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,479
Ling Long!

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,261
She’s like that because
her primordial spirit is removed.

144
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,458
Ling Long.

145
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,199
It’s my fault.

146
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,002
I am useless.

147
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,385
I am too useless!

148
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,632
I shouldn’t let Wu Tong take you away!

149
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,106
I should’ve saved you sooner!

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,119
Ling Long, please
wake up and scold me.

151
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,967
I won’t talk back.

152
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,093
Ling Long, I’ll never
make you angry again.

153
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,967
Please wake up, okay?

154
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,639
I’ll make you happy from now on.

155
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,670
Ling Long, please wake up, okay?

156
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,550
Ling Long, look.

157
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,750
I’ve been keeping the love lot with me.

158
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,199
This is our auspicious lot.

159
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,234
It says that we will have
our happily ever after.

160
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,105
How could I give this lot to anyone else?

161
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,239
I’ll use it to marry you.

162
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,477
I’ll read it in public
on the day of our wedding.

163
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,644
Ling Long.

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,986
Ling Long, please keep it.

165
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:11,844
Keep it, don’t reject me.

166
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,235
Keep it, okay?

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,618
Ling Long, please keep it.

168
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,479
Sixth Senior, don’t worry.

169
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,190
We’ll retrieve her primordial spirit
somehow.

170
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,654
Primordial spirit?

171
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,759
Sixth Senior, where are you going?

172
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,340
Min Yan, we’ll formulate a plan
to save Ling Long together.

173
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,919
Don’t stop me if you’re my brother.

174
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,638
Tell me then. Where are you
going to find her primordial spirit?

175
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,140
I’ll go to the Sky Hall’s hideout.

176
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,831
I brought her body out from that place.

177
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,230
But she’s still trapped inside there.

178
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,799
- I’ll find her back!
- There’s nothing left in there!

179
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,319
Wu Tong has escaped.
All the demons have escaped.

180
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,094
- Her primordial spirit isn’t there.
- I’ll capture some demons then.

181
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,759
I’ll ask every demon I encounter!

182
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,759
I’m sure I can find Wu Tong somehow!

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,809
- I’ll follow you.
- Okay.

184
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,510
So, where do we start our search?

185
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,668
Stop!

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,940
Master.

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,273
Where are you going?

188
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,839
We’re going to Sky Hall’s hideout
to retrieve Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

189
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,053
Nonsense!

190
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:33,958
Every sect is trying their best
to deal with Sky Hall now.

191
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,144
You expect me to waste time
worrying about you three?

192
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,314
Master, it’s all my fault.

193
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,700
I didn’t manage to protect Ling Long.

194
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,302
Only my death can atone for this mistake.

195
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,906
Master, please give me a chance
to atone for my mistake.

196
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,790
I’ll save Ling Long even if
it means sacrificing my life.

197
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:53,488
Forget it.

198
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:54,719
It’s not your fault.

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,666
Get up now.

200
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,474
Min Yan, we will save Ling Long.

201
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:02,519
But you can’t just go without a plan.

202
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,720
We’re interrogating a demon from Sky Hall.

203
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,479
It’s easier for us to act
if we have some clues.

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,919
Let me go!

205
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,199
Why are you capturing me?

206
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,239
- Why are you doing this?
- Senior Hao Chen, let’s talk.

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,799
- Why are you capturing me?
- Lu Yan Ran?

208
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,239
Let me go!

209
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,390
Senior Hao Chen, what are you doing?

210
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,551
She’s very suspicious.

211
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,879
I’ve never seen pupils
of Dianjinggu Sect used poison.

212
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,470
I’ve invited Valley Master Rong here
to verify her identity.

213
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,950
Senior, Yan Ran is indeed
the disciple of Dianjinggu Sect.

214
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:37,679
She traveled with us on our journey.

215
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,425
No! She’s a spy from Sky Hall!

216
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,696
I saw it for myself!

217
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,066
Zhong Min Yan, don’t frame me!

218
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,723
Who’s the spy here? I...

219
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,198
Min Yan, I’m sure
this is a misunderstanding.

220
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,879
Yan Ran did infiltrate Sky
Hall, but it’s not what you think.

221
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,599
Min Yan, put down your sword.
Let’s talk over this.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,439
There’s no misunderstanding!
She’s with Sky Hall!

223
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,319
She followed Wu Tong’s orders!

224
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,598
I saw it for myself! She killed
our people without mercy!

225
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,239
You mustn’t fall for her tricks!

226
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,999
Tell me! Where did Wu Tong
hide Ling Long’s primordial spirit?

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,719
I didn’t! I didn’t kill your people!

228
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,999
Si Feng, I...

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,359
Min Yan, put down your sword for now.

230
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,759
Maybe Valley Master Rong
has different plans for her.

231
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,167
Don’t be reckless.

232
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,052
No need for that!

233
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,629
She’s not from my sect.

234
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:30,672
Although I do have a disciple
named Lu Yan Ran,

235
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:34,632
she doesn’t look like her.
And she has returned to our sect.

236
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,879
Who exactly are you?

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,919
Why are you pretending to be
a disciple of my sect? What’s your motive?

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,830
Don’t tell me you’re a spy from Sky Hall?

239
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,692
My identity is none of your business!

240
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:47,239
Senior Hao Chen!

241
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,790
How dare you use poison!

242
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,030
Remove your disguise
and tell us your motive!

243
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,079
Lu Yan Ran is Silver Snake?

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,848
- Si Feng, this...
- Yu Si Feng!

245
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,879
Why did you hide the demon?

246
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,439
What’s your connection with her?

247
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,722
Hero Yu, what exactly is going on?

248
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,110
Elders, I did hide
something from you all.

249
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:20,395
Indeed. She’s not Lu Yan Ran
from the Dianjinggu Sect.

250
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,238
She’s my spirit beast, Silver Snake.

251
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,759
She infiltrated Sky Hall under my command.

252
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,639
But she’s not a spy.

253
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,239
Your spirit beast?

254
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,888
According to the Demon Manual,

255
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,712
spirit beasts can only acquire human forms
by feeding on human’s blood.

256
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:37,583
They’re vicious and evil.

257
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,128
Vice Palace Lord,

258
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,939
the Lize Palace actually allowed
one of your disciples to keep this demon?

259
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,559
And you even let that demon
pretended to be one of my disciples.

260
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,900
What’s the meaning of this?

261
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,759
I don’t know anything about this.
And it has nothing to do with our sect.

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,755
Si Feng, explain yourself!

263
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:55,586
Don’t try and ruin our reputation!

264
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:58,879
The Demon Manual was written
by our ancestors.

265
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,429
They have limited knowledge.

266
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,740
Silver Snake is not a demon.

267
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:06,087
She acquired her human form
because she consumed an immortal fruit.

268
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,758
And she has never harmed anyone before.

269
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,779
But the people have
prejudices against her kind.

270
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,764
In order to avoid any misunderstandings,

271
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,155
I had to cover up her identity.

272
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,919
After that, Sky Hall wreaked havoc.

273
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,239
I thought that it’ll be easier for her
to sneak in Sky Hall

274
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,186
since she’s not a human.

275
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:26,710
I was the one behind everything.

276
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,094
I did it out of good intentions.

277
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:31,685
How do you explain the fact
that she killed our people?

278
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:35,270
She’s my spirit beast.
We can sense each other.

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,710
I’ll know immediately
if she does kill someone.

280
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,519
Here, I promise that

281
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,750
Silver Snake will never
commit such atrocious acts.

282
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,094
Here, I also promise that

283
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:51,921
Silver Snake has always been loyal
to Si Feng and never betrayed him.

284
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,714
And she didn’t kill anyone.

285
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,230
How could you be guarantors
for her own acts?

286
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,300
Are you saying that I’m maligning her?

287
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:07,919
Are you saying that
what I’ve seen for myself is fake?

288
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,258
You don’t believe me?

289
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,829
Min Yan, it’s not that
I don’t believe you.

290
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,479
I’m sure this is a misunderstanding.

291
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,224
A misunderstanding?

292
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:18,790
Release it and everything will be clear.

293
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,911
Hero Yu, it’s not that I’m
suspicious of your character.

294
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,915
But the Sky Hall just attacked us.

295
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,856
And they managed to steal two spirit keys.

296
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,684
Everyone on Fuyu Island is jittery.

297
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:33,059
I find it hard to believe your statements.

298
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,536
How about this?

299
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,391
Release the spirit beast for now.

300
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,782
We’ll decide what to do
after our discussion.

301
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,590
Sorry, I’m unable to do that.

302
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,919
Yu Si Feng!

303
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,838
Are you... Are you trying to
work together with demons?

304
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,599
Did you forget your identity
as a cultivator?

305
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,750
There’s no demon for me
to work together with.

306
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,439
What do you mean by this?

307
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,959
Why are you risking yourself
to protect her?

308
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,176
Are you trying to ignore justice
and righteousness

309
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,887
because of your relationship with her?

310
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,398
Sixth Senior, I believe in him.

311
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,973
I’ve been with Silver Snake for so long.

312
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,559
She has never exuded any demonic scent.

313
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,830
Father, please believe in Si Feng.

314
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,847
Xuan Ji, stop your nonsense.

315
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,839
Why would Min Yan lie to us?

316
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,559
How can you prove this
when you’re not around?

317
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,826
I...

318
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:29,159
Sixth Senior, I’m sure you’re mistaken.

319
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,510
Xuan Ji, I wasn’t mistaken!

320
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,719
You don’t believe in me as well?

321
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,159
I...

322
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,776
Si Feng, I treat you as my brother.

323
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:40,670
I won’t suspect you.
But I don’t believe that demon.

324
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:43,198
Are you sure your sense
is correct at all time?

325
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,872
I saw her killing someone personally!

326
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,826
She’s with Sky Hall!

327
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,924
Don’t let her trick you!

328
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,519
Release her.

329
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,988
I just want to know where Wu Tong is

330
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,916
in order to save Ling Long
and Second Senior!

331
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,350
Min Yan, both of us
want to save Ling Long.

332
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,370
But Silver Snake doesn’t know
where Wu Tong is.

333
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,398
It’s no use forcing her.

334
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,826
My sense has never been mistaken.

335
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:15,830
I managed to find their hideout
because of that sense.

336
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,439
It’s all thanks to Silver Snake.

337
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,945
Min Yan, Silver Snake was hurt

338
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,552
because she was trying to protect me
from Wu Tong.

339
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:24,823
You shouldn’t blame her.

340
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,294
My lord! The demon in
the cell was murdered!

341
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,918
There’s Demon Corpse Poison on the weapon.

342
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,078
The poison entered his body
and dissolved him.

343
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,899
He was actually murdered?

344
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,410
There are still demons
hiding on Fuyu Island indeed.

345
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,910
Sect leaders, look.

346
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,699
You didn’t touch the weapon at all.

347
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,590
Why does your sleeve
have the same poison on it?

348
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,452
Take him down!

349
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,639
Wait! This must be a misunderstanding!

350
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,439
Si Feng, what exactly are you doing?

351
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,378
- What’s going on?
- Yu Si Feng.

352
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,354
I’ll treat it as if you acted rashly
in order to protect the snake demon.

353
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,879
But now, all the evidences are saying
that you’re the culprit behind this.

354
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,239
How do you explain this?

355
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,706
I’m sure you’re related to this!

356
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,017
It’s definitely not Si Feng.

357
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,105
Si Feng, hurry and explain yourself!

358
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,423
Xuan Ji.

359
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,691
Elders, I did come
to the cell before.

360
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,715
I just wanted to make the demon
reveal Wu Tong’s location.

361
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,510
But someone behind me murdered the demon.

362
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:52,164
As for the blood on my sleeve,

363
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:56,030
I got the stain when I was
trying to avoid the weapon.

364
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,038
I didn’t expect the weapon
to be coated with poison.

365
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,199
And I tried to pursue the assailant.

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,550
Where is he then? Did you catch him?

367
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,998
I lost him.

368
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,782
After that, many things happened.

369
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,294
And I couldn’t tell you in time.

370
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,750
But now,

371
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,319
it is proven that there are demons
hiding on Fuyu Island.

372
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,918
How could we trust your claim
without any evidences?

373
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,902
You said there are demons
hiding on Fuyu Island?

374
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,986
Most likely, it’s the snake demon
you’re not willing to release.

375
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,799
Yet you’re trying to protect her.
You’re very suspicious!

376
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,506
Everything I said was the truth.

377
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,441
I saw the demon’s back.

378
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,859
Elders, please give me some time.

379
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,210
I’ll capture the demon
hiding on the island.

380
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
- I’ll find out the truth.
- You’ll go nowhere.

381
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,355
You’re just trying to escape
because I caught you red-handed.

382
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,275
That’s not what I mean.

383
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,026
I just need a chance
to prove my innocence.

384
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,964
I’m willing to join Si Feng on his search.

385
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:58,079
You don’t need to involve yourself.

386
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,230
- I want to help you.
- Xuan Ji!

387
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,466
Yu Si Feng, I think you should
explain yourself.

388
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,839
I still don’t understand something.

389
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,696
You said you ordered your spirit beast
to infiltrate Sky Hall.

390
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,585
What’s the reason behind that?

391
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:18,310
I wanted her to find out
the location of their hideout.

392
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:20,383
So that I can obtain more information.

393
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,574
But your spirit beast had
infiltrated Sky Hall long ago.

394
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,232
She should’ve told you
the location long ago.

395
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,503
Why didn’t you mention it
to anyone before?

396
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,279
What’s wrong?

397
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,214
Is it because you didn’t have enough time?

398
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:36,165
Or is it because
you didn’t plan to tell us?

399
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:39,239
You’re full of deceit.

400
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,039
I’m afraid your spirit beast was
with Sky Hall in the first place.

401
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,390
You wanted to cover up for her,
but your lies are full of flaws.

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,509
Senior Hao Chen, your
deduction is illogical.

403
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,060
You still don’t want to admit it?

404
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,905
How dare you do something like this!

405
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:59,318
It’s either you were bewitched
by the snake demon,

406
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:04,599
or you were Sky Hall’s spy
in the first place.

407
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,159
No! Si Feng is not a demon!

408
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,319
You are saying that he’s the culprit
without investigating the truth!

409
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,279
- This isn’t right!
- Xuan Ji!

410
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,559
Youngsters shouldn’t interrupt
when elders are talking!

411
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,719
- Father, but you...
- What’s the point of defending him?

412
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,590
In my opinion, this is all
because of that snake demon.

413
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,959
Si Feng, if you want to
prove your innocence,

414
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,663
you should release the snake demon
and let everyone judge her.

415
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:28,414
It’s better for you and everyone else.

416
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,083
Silver Snake isn’t a demon.

417
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,394
She’s my spirit beast.

418
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,998
How could I let her suffer for no reason?

419
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,320
If I release her like this,

420
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,530
I’m afraid she wouldn’t survive.

421
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,521
Until when are you going to be stubborn?

422
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,679
Must you involve yourself
into this matter?

423
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,279
Where did you hide her? Let her out!

424
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,235
Min Yan, be rational.

425
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,319
You’re the irrational one here.

426
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,826
I need to wake you up!

427
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,548
Sixth Senior!

428
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,350
Sect leaders, look!

429
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,510
The black and white rings?

430
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,119
This ring belongs to Sky Hall.

431
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,230
You still dare to deny that you’re a demon
when you have them?

432
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,472
Silver Snake acquired them
when she infiltrated Sky Hall.

433
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,164
It isn’t surprising that I have them.

434
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,390
You! How dare you deny the truth!

435
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,391
Si Feng!

436
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,070
Si Feng!

437
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,165
Xuan Ji!

438
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,479
Vice Palace Lord, I’m impressed.

439
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,839
But Yu Si Feng is a disciple
of the Lize Palace.

440
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,790
Vice Palace Lord,
please find out the truth.

441
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,928
This concerns the
very existence of all living beings.

442
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,546
Lize Palace will never show favoritism.

443
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,225
You rebel, you insist
on doing this by yourself.

444
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:07,016
Even Lize Palace
can’t protect you right now.

445
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,910
Sect leaders, you three
may interrogate him.

446
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,039
Si Feng!

447
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,790
Xuan Ji, that’s enough.

448
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,774
Senior, Si Feng isn’t a demon.
He didn’t do all those things.

449
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:25,638
He has nothing to do with Sky Hall at all.

450
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,519
We’ve engaged Sky Hall several times.

451
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,802
He has slain so many demons.
He was hurt by them as well.

452
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:33,079
How could he be a demon?
They’re arresting the wrong person.

453
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,231
It’s no use even if you tell me all these.

454
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,302
The three sect leaders
will make their own decisions.

455
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,092
I’ve pleaded with Uncle Dong Fang
and the rest.

456
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,959
But they ignored me.

457
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,350
Senior, Si Feng will surely
suffer inside the cell.

458
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:50,315
So, are you asking me to plead with them?

459
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,434
- I...
- Do you know why I sealed your powers?

460
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,279
I didn’t want you to act recklessly.

461
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,399
Are you still trying to involve
the entire Shaoyang Sect into this?

462
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,509
But I know Si Feng was framed.

463
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,472
Only you think that he’s framed.

464
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:07,026
Every evidence is pointing
towards him right now.

465
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,152
Even Lize Palace is staying out of this.

466
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,958
But you still insist on defending him.

467
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:15,239
Do you know how terrible it would be

468
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,950
if the other sects think that
our sect is in cahoots with the demons?

469
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,359
But I know that Si Feng isn’t a demon.

470
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,397
Senior, he doesn’t have a demonic scent.

471
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,158
It’s the same for Silver Snake.

472
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,430
I’ve known him for so long.
We’ve been through a lot together.

473
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:33,768
If he’s a demon, I would’ve known it.

474
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:38,198
Did you forget that Wolf managed
to deceive us with his disguise?

475
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,638
They have a way to cover their scent.

476
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:42,759
But it has flaws.

477
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,868
When Wolf was transforming,
I can smell his demonic scent.

478
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,640
But it’s different for Si Feng.

479
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,964
Senior, don’t you believe me?
I don’t know how to tell lies.

480
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:56,199
But who knows? Maybe they have
a better method to cover up their scent.

481
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,839
Xuan Ji, there’s nothing certain
in this world.

482
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,359
What we can do is to prepare
ourselves and take precautions.

483
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,839
- But...
- Enough!

484
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,439
If he’s not a demon,
and he didn’t commit any crime,

485
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,599
the three sect leaders
will release him naturally.

486
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,352
If you believe in him, you should wait.

487
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:16,239
We will know the result soon.

488
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,578
But there’s one thing.

489
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:19,599
I won’t allow you
to plead for Yu Si Feng anymore.

490
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,968
And create trouble for your father.
Do you understand?

491
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,350
If so,

492
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,359
Senior, can you unseal my powers?

493
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,619
Impossible.

494
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,740
If it weren’t for the fact that
we can’t leave the island,

495
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:35,731
I wouldn’t have let you stay here.

496
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,786
I won’t unseal your powers

497
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:40,207
before we return to Shaoyang.

498
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,030
So that you won’t act recklessly
based on your impulse.

499
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:46,487
In the end, you still
don’t believe in me.

500
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:48,399
You don’t believe that
Si Feng isn’t a demon.

501
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,630
Don’t worry,

502
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:53,070
I will find the hidden demon
and prove Si Feng’s innocence.

503
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,546
Xuan Ji!

504
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,726
Vice Palace Lord.

505
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,839
What has Yu Si Feng’s matter
got to do with you?

506
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,559
You’re considerate.

507
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,151
Becoming his friend is not the reason
I allowed you to follow him.

508
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,399
I don’t dare to do so.

509
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,076
I’m doing this for Lize Palace’s sake.

510
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,799
If it’s for Lize Palace’s sake,
you should’ve disassociated from him.

511
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,597
If the other sects think that
he’s in cahoots with the demons,

512
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,639
just let it be.

513
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,710
It has nothing to do with Lize Palace.
Do you understand?

514
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,785
Yes.

515
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,306
Dianjinggu Sect is an expert
in creating torture devices.

516
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:38,097
Yu Si Feng may be tough,

517
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,719
but you aren’t.

518
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,758
You should care for your own body.

519
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,199
You got to escape the 13 Punishments
and leave Lize Palace once again

520
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,110
even though you lost your mask.

521
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,989
Ruo Yu,

522
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,337
I’ve done so much for you, you know?

523
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:59,005
You still owe me some punishments.

524
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,710
Didn’t you say you wanted to
bring your sister out?

525
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,548
Kneel here and
reflect on your actions.

526
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,423
Why has it come to this?

527
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,510
Everything went wrong

528
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:34,066
after I lost you.

529
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,705
First, it was you. Now, it’s Si Feng.

530
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:40,318
Why is he so insistent on
defending that snake demon?

531
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,589
Why does he not believe in me?

532
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,540
I’m sure that demon snake knows something.

533
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:48,590
I can find out where Wu Tong is
as long as he releases that demon.

534
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,417
Why isn’t he trying to help me?

535
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,849
Ling Long,

536
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:01,854
I’ll bring you back for sure.

537
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,008
I’ll bring you back

538
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,969
no matter where he’s hiding you.

539
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,124
Look at your bad temper.

540
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,510
Calm down.
I won’t keep you here for too long.

541
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,950
I thought of something interesting.

542
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,957
Do you know what this is?

543
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,460
It’s the Soul Bell.

544
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:08,999
I’ll absorb your primordial
spirit and keep your soul intact.

545
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,973
Your life won’t be in danger,
but you’ll be unconscious.

546
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,404
And it’ll be easy for me to tame you.

547
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:19,533
When your body only listens to me,

548
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:21,484
I’ll give you back your primordial spirit.

549
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,830
I would rather die

550
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,908
than to become your puppet.

551
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:33,539
Kill me!

552
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,950
It’s a pity that
they’ve snatched your body.

553
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,310
But I can create another body for you.

554
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,102
You will be mine in the end.

555
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,315
My lord,

556
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,799
I found a Banana Spirit
that’s going to acquire a human form soon.

557
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,367
But it’s experiencing
heavenly tribulation.

558
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,718
My lord, is that spirit what you wanted?

559
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,099
Banana Spirit?

560
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,154
Great.

561
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,004
It’s so scary! Anyone there?
Come and save me!

562
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:13,395
The heavenly tribulation is too scary!

563
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,748
Did you help me get through it?

564
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:29,470
Did you save me? I’ll repay you.

565
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,830
What do you want? I can give you anything.

566
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,558
Do you want me to marry you?

567
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,879
I want you to transform
into the image I want.

568
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,679
Is that so? That’s easy.

569
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,830
Can I come closer? I want to see
the image inside your mind.

570
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,474
Is this the face you want?
Are you satisfied?

571
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,710
You don’t like it?

572
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,495
The appearance is pretty good.

573
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,973
But you lack something.

574
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,955
I’ll leave your soul intact.

575
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,903
And leave half of
your primordial spirit inside.

576
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:56,509
You’ll only remember that we met before.

577
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,001
I don’t want anything else.

578
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,537
Only half of her primordial spirit
entered the body?

579
00:35:17,538 --> 00:35:19,768
It’s hard to contain it
using a different body indeed.

580
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,310
So stubborn. This will have to do then.

581
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,644
You will be mine in the end.

582
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,710
Who are you? Why are you so close to me?

583
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,635
What are you laughing at?
I’ll scratch your face if you laugh!

584
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:05,985
You little ingrate,

585
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:09,256
I helped you to get through
the heavenly tribulation, you know?

586
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,079
I would’ve survived
even if you didn’t help me.

587
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,288
But since you’re a good
guy, I won’t hold it against you.

588
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,550
Good guy?

589
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,159
I’m not a good guy.
I only mind my own business.

590
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,199
I saved you because
you were destined to be mine.

591
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,239
I’ve named you as well.
Your name is Ling Long.

592
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,670
I thought you were a good guy.
So, you’re a tyrant.

593
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:45,853
But I like the name Ling Long.

594
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:47,639
I’ll accept it for now.

595
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,995
As for me,

596
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,830
we can talk about it when you catch me.

597
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,390
I told you before. You are mine.

598
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,672
Where are you trying to go?

599
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,190
Where is that demon hiding?

600
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:33,542
Why can’t I smell it?

601
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,271
You’ve searched the entire Fuyu Island.

602
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,279
You searched all the places you could.

603
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,192
Did you find anything?

604
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:59,143
Sixth Senior, you’ve been following me?

605
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,039
Master wanted me to look after you.
He didn’t want you to go overboard.

606
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,279
Do you think Lord Dong Fang
doesn’t know what you’re up to?

607
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,710
He let you off because Master is around.

608
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,823
But you went to watch the training
of his disciples.

609
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,485
That is a huge taboo.

610
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:16,279
I didn’t want to watch their training.

611
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,319
I just wanted to see if I can
sense any demonic scent from them.

612
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,879
No one can enter or leave Fuyu Island now.
I’m sure the demon is still here.

613
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,456
I need to find it. If not,
Si Feng will be in danger.

614
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:26,839
Xuan Ji, that’s enough.

615
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,434
That demon is in the cell.

616
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:30,585
It’s the snake demon
Si Feng wanted to defend so much.

617
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:35,121
Everything will be solved
as long as he releases her.

618
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:41,768
Si Feng knew that Ling Long
will never return if we don’t retrieve

619
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,271
her primordial spirit within three months.

620
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,639
But he doesn’t care at all.

621
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,159
Now, do you still think
what Si Feng was right?

622
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,324
Sixth Senior, how could you
think of Si Feng in that way?

623
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,359
Si Feng cares about Ling Long too.

624
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,994
Like us, he’s worried about
Ling Long as well.

625
00:38:59,995 --> 00:39:01,596
But you arrested the wrong person.

626
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:03,750
- It’s useless if you interrogate him.
- This...

627
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,799
I don’t know what to think right now.

628
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,079
I only know that Silver Snake
is our only clue.

629
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,110
Valley Master Rong and the rest
will force an answer from him.

630
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,399
Master told me that they’re
torturing Si Feng right now.

631
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,039
But he’s still very stubborn.

632
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,910
He’s asking for trouble.

633
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,359
They tortured him?

634
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,304
How could they do that?

635
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:28,779
Xuan Ji!

636
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,216
Where is the stronghold of Sky Hall?

637
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:46,567
And where did Wolf take Qing Rong?

638
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,990
I’m not a demon from Sky Hall.

639
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,990
If I do work for the Sky Hall,

640
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,273
why do I need to reveal
the deceit of your wife?

641
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:02,030
Isn’t it better for me to escape with her
while holding the spirit keys?

642
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,136
Lord Dong Fang,

643
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,239
think about it.

644
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:11,696
Coincidentally, every evidence

645
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,712
is pointing towards me,

646
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,710
but the points don’t make sense.

647
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,613
I could’ve stolen
the Destiny Pearl from Xuan Ji.

648
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,284
Why do I need to attack my own hideout

649
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,484
and save Ling Long
when it could’ve revealed my identity?

650
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,672
The Sky Hall is full of devious plans.

651
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,158
Who knows? Maybe this is your plan
to steal all four spirit keys from us.

652
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,638
I believed in Ouyang before.

653
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,309
And I believed in Qing Rong as well.

654
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,079
But now, I know that

655
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,430
believing in others
is the biggest mistake in my life.

656
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,150
Lord Dong Fang, I understand.

657
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:10,183
Once bitten, twice shy.

658
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:11,774
But I’m not a demon.

659
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,792
Even if you hold me captive,

660
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,595
you’re only wasting your time.

661
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:24,119
There are demons hiding on the island.

662
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:27,426
You’re just trying to buy time.

663
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,230
Fine, I’ll grant you your wish.

664
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,590
Lord Dong Fang.

665
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,319
Didn’t we agree that
we’ll interrogate him together?

666
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,759
What now?

667
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,524
You did this out of
your personal intention.

668
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:55,950
Do you think your personal matters
are more important than our sects?

669
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,644
Valley Master Rong, it’s not that serious.

670
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,039
I did this out of
personal intention indeed.

671
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,279
But I just wanted to solve
my matters on Fuyu Island.

672
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,759
I will always consider the bigger picture.

673
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,585
Moreover, isn’t it our goal to find out
their plans and location?

674
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:15,039
That’s good to hear.

675
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,520
Now, it’s time for us to be united.

676
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,745
We mustn’t create any unnecessary trouble.

677
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,296
Did he reveal anything?

678
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:24,719
This is a heavy punishment.

679
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,684
If he’s innocent, we’ll...

680
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:28,171
Sect Leader Chu,

681
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,612
the enemies will overwhelm us soon.

682
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:33,443
This is not the time for you
to be merciful.

683
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,246
If the Sky Hall execute their plans,

684
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,210
if they steal the spirit keys from
Lize Palace and Dianjunggu Sect

685
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:45,039
and unseal the Jade Cup,
everything will be too late.

686
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,270
Moreover, he’s a huge suspect.
How is he innocent?

687
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:52,213
This demon is very tough.

688
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:56,765
He won’t tell us the truth if
we don’t torture him harshly.

689
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,639
Yu Si Feng.

690
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,039
These are the Hell’s Nails.
They’re made for interrogations.

691
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,682
They can’t kill you.

692
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:14,319
But you will suffer unimaginable pain
when they’re in your body.

693
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,919
I won’t stop until you can’t
stand the pain and tell us the truth.

694
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,294
Before I use them, I’ll
give you one last chance.

695
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,050
You better know what’s good for you.

696
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:26,721
I’ve told you the truth.

697
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,990
If you still don’t believe in me,

698
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:33,456
I have no words to say.

699
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:37,214
Let’s see how long you can last!

700
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,239
No one is to enter without
Lord Dong Fang’s permission.

701
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,239
- Miss Chu, please return.
- I...

702
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,031
Let me in. There’s an emergency.
I need to see my father.

703
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:02,119
Stop it now. Are you trying
to force your way through?

704
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,550
You’ll create trouble for Master
if you continue this.

705
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,599
- Return with me!
- Si Feng is innocent!

706
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,364
He can’t stand the torture!
You can’t do this!

707
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:15,239
Tell me honestly, is Dianjinggu
Sect the next target of Sky Hall?

708
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,198
How do you plan your attacks?

709
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,161
Where is the stronghold of Sky Hall?

710
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:35,792
Are there any other spies besides you?

711
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,919
Yu Si Feng, if
you’re truly innocent,

712
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,987
you should release your spirit beast.

713
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:45,538
So that you can give us an explanation.

714
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,988
Give you an explanation?

715
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,390
The Five Great Sects

716
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,789
were arrogant

717
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,932
and harbored selfish desires.

718
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,230
All of you didn’t treat
Sky Hall seriously.

719
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:13,104
Now that everything has gone to hell

720
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,310
and the spirit keys stolen,

721
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,716
you are just trying to

722
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,950
find an excuse for your mistakes.

723
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,866
You wanted someone
to be the scapegoat.

724
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,032
My spirit beast and I will
never be your scapegoats.

725
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,310
I’ll endure

726
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:37,815
the punishment myself.

727
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,412
Fine!
