00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,494
<i>EPISODE 37</i>

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,279
Palace Lord?

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,108
Looks like all of you are very forgetful.

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,799
- What happened?
- We fell into a trap.

6
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,310
I never thought that the Fire Lion
will store Putrid Mist inside its belly.

7
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,851
- We can’t get out now.
- We can’t get out?

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,466
Be careful!

9
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,759
- Flying Snake, are you okay?
- This is not okay.

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,119
Fire Lion grew up in the Putrid Mist.

11
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,347
Here, it is almost invincible.

12
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,493
Flying Snake!

13
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,239
What should we do now?

14
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,677
How do I know?

15
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:08,100
It can swallow Dingkun’s energy
as well as my fire.

16
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:16,719
Now that it has come to this,
there’s no need to say anything else.

17
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,437
- Attack!
- Noon is here.

18
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:20,378
Let’s activate the
Demon Prison Formation now.

19
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,039
Today is the end for Lize Palace.

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,613
Annihilate Lize Palace to
save the world from disaster.

21
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,668
All of you came prepared.

22
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,263
You must have put in so much effort

23
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,287
to use so many precious weapons
to attack Lize Palace.

24
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:51,950
But you have to know one thing.

25
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:56,479
No matter how good you are,
demons will always be better than you.

26
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,519
Purple Fox?

27
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,759
Who is Purple Fox?

28
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,839
Long story. I’ll tell you later.

29
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,069
Be careful.

30
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:30,186
I don’t know why the Sun Stone
will become tainted.

31
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:36,159
If you burn the Neidan of fox
demon with Bone-Quenching Fire,

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,879
you can use the fox’s aura

33
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,744
to corrupt all magical weapons
in this world.

34
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,703
What else can you do? Show me.

35
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:17,234
Although our weapon is destroyed,
as long as

36
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,359
any of us are still standing
we’ll fight you demons to the end!

37
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,248
- Fight you demons to the end!
- Kill them all!

38
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,379
We can’t keep fighting like this.

39
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,617
Be careful!

40
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,919
- Flying Snake, your arm!
- I even used my Life Fire to burn it.

41
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,758
But it still bit me.

42
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,639
What should we do now?

43
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,646
Why are you always whining
after turning into a mortal?

44
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,119
I’m a heavenly officer.

45
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
I can just use a few thousand years
of my spiritual power to heal it.

46
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,597
Moreover, I’ll look very fierce
with this wound, right?

47
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:37,639
I’m very fierce.

48
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,060
No. We can’t just waste our energy here.

49
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,756
We have to find a way to go out.

50
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,319
I want to go out too.

51
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,382
But you are a mortal now. You can’t
use God of War’s Ninth Heaven Fire.

52
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,799
You can’t break this Putrid Mist.
How can we get out?

53
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,203
Ninth Heaven Fire?

54
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:59,901
Flying Snake, teach me.
Maybe I’ll be able to use it.

55
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,369
Only God of War knows how
to use the Ninth Heaven Fire.

56
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,919
The fire of creation has
its own spiritual power.

57
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,488
It’ll take a massive amount of
one’s spiritual power to use it.

58
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:10,719
You are a mortal now. You only
have a little bit of spiritual power.

59
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,118
Xuan Ji, I have a solution.

60
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,695
You should run away now.

61
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:15,879
I won’t run away.

62
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,901
We have a blood oath.
I won’t leave you behind.

63
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:20,496
We’ll stick together until the end.

64
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,239
Stinky woman.

65
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,278
I’ll transfer my qi to you.

66
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:06,104
- Master.
- Silver Snake.

67
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,533
Demon’s blood can loosen this Demon Rope.

68
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,479
Master, leave now.

69
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,810
No need to care about me.

70
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:28,818
Leave now!

71
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,567
Vice Palace Lord.

72
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,258
Let’s go. Let’s leave Dianjinggu at once.

73
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,628
Didn’t palace lord ask you to meet up
with him after you get the stalactite?

74
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,238
You are really loyal.

75
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,270
Don’t you care about our clan’s survival?

76
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,559
Go and tell palace lord that

77
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,679
I already took care of
the vital matter of Lize Palace.

78
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,719
As for his personal matter,
ask him to settle it himself.

79
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,454
I don’t have time to take the stalactite.

80
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,184
Ask him to get it himself.

81
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,240
Palace Lord.

82
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,653
- What is it?
- Vice palace lord has left on his own.

83
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,759
Where’s the stalactite?

84
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,477
He said that he didn’t
have the time to take it.

85
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:42,458
He asked you to get it yourself.

86
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,395
Let’s go.

87
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,099
Master.

88
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,618
Ling Long!

89
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,500
Die!

90
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:01,883
Stinky woman.

91
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:06,340
I’m exhausted because of you.

92
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,854
- Flying Snake!
- Xuan Ji!

93
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,149
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

94
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,180
What happened?

95
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,156
This is Lize Palace’s doing.

96
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,839
They are the demons’ accomplice.

97
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,549
They even burnt Purple Fox’s
Neidan to taint our weapon.

98
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,330
They killed a lot of our people.

99
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,585
Take care of Flying Snake for me.

100
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,286
Master.

101
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,119
Stop pressuring me!

102
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,421
Master, what are you going to do?

103
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,189
Why do you have to attack those sects?

104
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,599
They are ready for you.

105
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,901
Ask our people to retreat now.

106
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,049
Si Feng.

107
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,117
Stop being so naive.

108
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:59,517
There’s no turning back.

109
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:03,315
My junior already took away
Dianjinggu’s Seven Star Disc.

110
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,199
If we don’t kill them,
they are going to retaliate

111
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,773
- and kill us all.
- Seven Star Disc?

112
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,785
Vice palace lord took away the spirit key?

113
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:14,959
Master.

114
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,599
Tell me the truth.

115
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,198
What’s the relationship between
Lize Palace and Sky Hall?

116
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,453
I don’t care about Sky Hall.

117
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:23,719
I just want to revive Hao Feng.

118
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,879
He took away Seven Star Disc
and left my stalactite behind.

119
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,317
When I go back, I’ll punish him!

120
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,631
Master.

121
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,486
You’ve been used by
vice palace lord and Sky Hall.

122
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,550
They are using you to cripple the sects.

123
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:39,629
This is their conspiracy plan.
Let’s leave at once.

124
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,477
Leave?

125
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,095
It’s too late.

126
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:45,063
This time,

127
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,372
I’m going to avenge your mother.

128
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,954
My mother?

129
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,217
<i>DIANJINGGU: WEN HAO FENG</i>

130
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:16,948
Hao Feng

131
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,694
is your mother.

132
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:26,948
Dianjinggu doesn’t have the rights
to keep the portrait of her.

133
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,102
This is my mother?

134
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,099
But Master,

135
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,827
you told me that Hao Feng is your...

136
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,810
That’s right.

137
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,636
Hao Feng is my wife.

138
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,217
She is your mother too.

139
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,739
Then, Master...

140
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,073
Who are you?

141
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,242
I...

142
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:01,954
I am your master.

143
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,595
But I am your father too.

144
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,608
Si Feng.

145
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:36,896
You’ve grown up now.

146
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:40,452
It’s time for me to tell you everything.

147
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,491
Father?

148
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:53,223
Back then, I fell in
love with your mother.

149
00:15:56,158 --> 00:16:00,173
That’s why she was forced
to kill herself by Dianjinggu.

150
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,728
Luckily, after all these years,

151
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,101
after so much effort that I put in,

152
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,894
I’ve finally found

153
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,475
the 1000-year-old stalactite
that can revive your mother.

154
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:20,526
After we go back to Lize
Palace and revive your mother,

155
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:24,166
I’ll tell you everything.

156
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:25,907
Could it be that

157
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,645
my mother has always been in Lize Palace?

158
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,279
That’s right.

159
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,613
I’ve been keeping her in an ice coffin
under the underground palace

160
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:35,964
so that

161
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,474
I can one day revive her.

162
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,559
Si Feng.

163
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,909
I’ve kept you in the dark
for so many years.

164
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,883
Do you hate me?

165
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,270
I’m such a dummy.

166
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:54,889
When I was young,

167
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:59,777
you gave me my mother’s
silver hairpin and portrait.

168
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,102
You even told me a lot of stories
about you and mother.

169
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:07,744
Others would have
already guessed it.

170
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,496
Palace Lord, this is bad.

171
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,599
We have a lot of casualties.
They ganged up on us.

172
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,359
They are already outside now!

173
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,771
Master, stop fighting!

174
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:48,839
Sect Leader Chu, there’s must be
some misunderstanding. Let me explain.

175
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,678
You are just the jackal of Sky Hall.

176
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,839
You worked with them
to steal the spirit keys.

177
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,503
I won’t let you escape today.

178
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,509
Master, stop fighting.

179
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,490
You want to side the human clan?

180
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,662
How dare you!

181
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,390
Master, no!

182
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,239
Rose Gold Bird Demon!

183
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,359
So, everyone in Lize Palace is a demon.

184
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,843
All these years, we’ve let you
demons joined our righteous sects.

185
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,199
What a humiliation!

186
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,951
Today, we are going to
annihilate Lize Palace!

187
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:49,797
I’m going to destroy
every sect here today!

188
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:38,839
Master!

189
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,120
Si Feng!

190
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,119
Sect Leader Chu, don’t fight him.

191
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,371
Mortals can’t defeat 12 Feathers
Rose Gold Bird Demon in full power.

192
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,253
Shoot those demons down!

193
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,980
Hurry up! Let’s fight them together!

194
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,679
Si Feng, you unfilial son!

195
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,453
Master, they are just innocent mortals.

196
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,079
Don’t hurt them anymore.

197
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,708
Move aside!

198
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,771
Don’t hurt Si Feng!

199
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,500
Xuan Ji!

200
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:29,498
Si Feng!

201
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,664
Si Feng! You are hurt.

202
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,431
Xuan Ji.

203
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,319
- Why are you here?
- Si Feng.

204
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,725
What happened?

205
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,058
What happened to Lize Palace?

206
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,599
Xuan Ji, you still don’t understand?

207
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,279
Everyone in Lize Palace is a demon.
Yu Si Feng is a demon too!

208
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,006
You are the daughter
of Shaoyang Sect’s leader.

209
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:59,350
But you are still siding that demon now.

210
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:01,331
Have you no care for Shaoyang?

211
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,439
Father, there must be a misunderstanding.

212
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,079
Si Feng is not a demon.

213
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,839
Even if everyone in Lize Palace
is a demon, he’s not.

214
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,069
I’ve never detected a hint of
demon aura from him.

215
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,149
Moreover, you’ve already checked
his identity with the Demon Whip, right?

216
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,210
Why are you accusing him now?

217
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,035
Xuan Ji, look at this.

218
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,901
This is crystal dragon seal that can
conceal the aura of Rose Gold Bird Demon.

219
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,743
Every disciple of Lize Palace has one.

220
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,457
That’s why he could bear the two whips
from Demon Whip.

221
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,846
If it wasn’t because you stopped me
the third time, he would’ve shown himself.

222
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,558
Xuan Ji, you’ve been tricked by him!

223
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,138
What is this?

224
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,074
I’ve seen it on you as well.

225
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,199
I know.

226
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,414
Ting Nu gave you this
to help you recover, right?

227
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,420
Yes.

228
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,353
Senior.

229
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,728
You’ve misunderstood.

230
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,958
Ting Nu gave this to Si Feng
to help him recover.

231
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,197
It’s not a seal to conceal
his demonic aura.

232
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:05,999
Father, I can guarantee with my life.

233
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,703
- Si Feng is not a demon.
- Xuan Ji.

234
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,439
Stop it.

235
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,776
Why should I stop?

236
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,679
I’m going to explain it to them.

237
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,545
I’ll tell them that you are not a demon.

238
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:18,679
- Yu Si Feng!
- Si Feng.

239
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,885
You still don’t dare to tell Xuan Ji
whether you are

240
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,669
a human or a demon?

241
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:26,097
Si Feng.

242
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,660
You told me that you are not
a demon on Fuyu Island.

243
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:33,639
You won’t lie to me, right?

244
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,319
Tell me that you are not a demon, Si Feng.

245
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,205
I’ll believe whatever you say.

246
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,108
- I’ll believe you.
- I’m sorry.

247
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,396
I’m sorry.

248
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,679
You are Si Feng.
Of course I trust you, Si Feng.

249
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,101
I know that you are not a demon.

250
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,557
You have nothing to do with Sky Hall.

251
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,899
I am not

252
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,034
a demon from Sky Hall.

253
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,820
No.

254
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,679
No.

255
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,335
Si Feng, you look so handsome
when you smile.

256
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,780
No.

257
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,509
Impossible.

258
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,650
I’ve never thought that
you are troublesome.

259
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,304
And I’ve never wanted to
stay away from you.

260
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,466
Impossible.

261
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,279
Impossible.

262
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,319
With me by your side, no matter
what we face, I’ll protect you.

263
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,740
Si Feng!

264
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,447
Are you leaving because you
are upset after I pushed you away?

265
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:03,519
I took off your mask.

266
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,579
Of course I’ll take
the responsibility for you.

267
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,127
Really?

268
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,679
You have different statuses.

269
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,380
And that is the greatest sin
in their eyes.

270
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,114
You didn’t see anything.

271
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,343
But you are so sure that I was wronged.

272
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,429
- Do you trust me that much?
- Of course

273
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,844
I know what kind of a person you are.

274
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,110
You are different from them.

275
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,957
Don’t be afraid.

276
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:34,420
No matter what happened,
you’ll always be Chu Xuan Ji.

277
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,284
I do have some things to tell you.

278
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,543
But

279
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:41,999
I can’t write it on the wind bell.

280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,495
Because this is

281
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,083
a secret that I have to bring
to my grave with me.

282
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:52,417
After you unlock this
Lugong puzzle, you’ll see it.

283
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,502
If she finds out about your real identity,

284
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,679
do you think she’ll still protect you?

285
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
Xuan Ji is different.

286
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,542
She won’t hurt me.

287
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:19,997
You are different from her.

288
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,880
Human clan always kills those
who are not from the same clan.

289
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,171
Didn’t you say that
you’ll love him forever?

290
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,439
So what if he’s a demon?

291
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,999
You can’t love a demon?

292
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,359
Xuan Ji.

293
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,799
- Time to wake up.
- No.

294
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,750
Lize Palace has killed
so many people today.

295
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,999
If we don’t get rid of them,
there’ll be serious consequences!

296
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,540
Arrest him!

297
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,280
Si Feng!

298
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,987
No.

299
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,637
No.

300
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,879
Si Feng!

301
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,614
Don’t hurt Si Feng!

302
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,060
Si Feng.

303
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,839
Si Feng!

304
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,639
Say it.

305
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,999
Tell them that

306
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,294
no matter what Lize Palace did,
it has nothing to do with you.

307
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:42,679
Si Feng, tell them that

308
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,157
what the palace lord did
has nothing to do with you.

309
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,999
He and you are different.

310
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,180
You’ve never hurt anyone before.

311
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
Si Feng!

312
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,366
Si Feng, explain it to them!

313
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,864
Si Feng!

314
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,039
No!

315
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,599
Si Feng!

316
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,965
Xuan Ji, stop this obsession!

317
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,479
Look carefully!

318
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,220
Not only Yu Si Feng is a demon,

319
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,239
he’s from Rose Gold Bird Demon clan
who killed your mother!

320
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,479
That’s right! Back then, your mother
brought you to a medic and ran into

321
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,199
Heroine Hao Feng who had been missing
for years outside of Dianjinggu.

322
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,294
She was chased down by
Rose Gold Bird Demon. You remember

323
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:22,048
how your mother died, right?

324
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,994
We and Rose Gold Bird Demon
are sworn enemies!

325
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,117
Xuan Ji.

326
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,399
Believe me.

327
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,199
- Si Feng.
- There must be a misunderstanding.

328
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,999
I’ll get to the bottom of this.

329
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,251
Si Feng.

330
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,340
Are you still going to
make things right for this girl?

331
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,559
Fine.

332
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,660
You should just let her kill me then.

333
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:55,079
It’s you.

334
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,599
So, you are that woman’s child.

335
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,458
If I had known, I
would’ve killed you too.

336
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,480
Master.

337
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,631
What did you say?

338
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:27,304
The Rose Gold Bird Demon
who killed my mother is you?

339
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,677
You’ve always known
about this right, Si Feng?

340
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:37,219
I didn’t keep this from you.

341
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,306
You’ve been lying to me, Si Feng!

342
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,775
Si Feng!

343
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:48,609
There must be a misunderstanding.

344
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,577
Xuan Ji.

345
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,799
Si Feng.

346
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,530
You should’ve known that
this is the result that you’ll get!

347
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:09,955
So,

348
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,733
you are that Rose Gold Bird Demon.

349
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,022
Today, I’m going to avenge my mother!

350
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:17,365
Come on!

351
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,341
Dingkun Sword!

352
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,377
Xuan Ji.

353
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,514
No.

354
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,560
Xuan Ji.

355
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,574
What kind of demonic spell is this?

356
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:19,082
He is absorbing our qi.

357
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,399
Master.

358
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,575
No.

359
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:32,845
Master! No!

360
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,787
Xuan Ji.

361
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:51,774
Master.

362
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:53,592
Don’t kill anyone anymore!

363
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,915
I’m going to kill you!

364
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:25,239
Xuan Ji, don’t go there.

365
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,839
He’s using his demonic core
to gather up spiritual power.

366
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,767
It’s very powerful. You’ll get hurt.

367
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,199
I can’t let him hurt them anymore.

368
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,090
Let go of me! I want to kill him!

369
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,359
You can’t kill him with your power now.

370
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,759
Believe in me.

371
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,034
Xuan Ji.

372
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,889
Don’t force me!

373
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,102
Si Feng!

374
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:16,799
Xuan Ji.

375
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,985
Don’t worry.

376
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,710
I won’t let him kill anyone anymore.

377
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,130
Si Feng.

378
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,900
You’ve been lying to me.

379
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,985
I’m sorry.

380
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:29,578
Master.

381
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,104
Si Feng! What are you doing?

382
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:37,040
Master.

383
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,318
Stop.

384
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:41,999
Stop!

385
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,159
Yu Si Feng is a 12 Feathers
Rose Gold Bird Demon too.

386
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,576
Let’s kill them together! Xuan Ji! Do it!

387
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,115
Si Feng!

388
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:20,399
Si Feng.

389
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,540
Si Feng, your Loveless Curse
has been activated.

390
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,021
Si Feng.

391
00:37:57,335 --> 00:37:59,231
Why is it like this?

392
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,220
I have to get to the bottom of this.

393
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,154
Xuan Ji!

394
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:13,511
Si Feng.

395
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,285
Xuan Ji is your demon.

396
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:18,376
You are too obsessed with her.

397
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,381
Si Feng.

398
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,888
Master.

399
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:34,904
Am I going to

400
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,639
die soon?

401
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,140
You’ll be fine.

402
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,621
This is just the pain
from the Loveless Curse.

403
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:46,947
With me here,

404
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,137
you’ll be fine.

405
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:58,751
Come.

406
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,309
Si Feng.

407
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,999
How are you feeling?

408
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,540
Go now.

409
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,624
I have to go back.

410
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,999
Go back?

411
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,839
You are still thinking about that girl?

412
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,119
She saw that you are a demon.

413
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,230
She’ll just think about the grudge with
Rose Gold Bird Demon.

414
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:33,218
She just wants you dead.

415
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,378
No.

416
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,806
Xuan Ji will not be like that.

417
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,202
I owe her this.

418
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,119
I have to make things right for her.

419
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,399
What a cursed relationship.
What can I do to make you give up?

420
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,287
You know that she
won’t forgive you.

421
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,586
She hates you.

422
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,441
Listen to me. Forget about her.

423
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,661
Put her away from your mind
and don’t mention about her again.

424
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:03,796
If you go back, you’ll die.

425
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,559
You’ve been lying to me, Si Feng!

426
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,144
Si Feng!

427
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,539
Si Feng.

428
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,838
Si Feng!

429
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,478
Look. She still won’t let you go.

430
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,447
She wants to kill us!

431
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,693
Si Feng!

432
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:52,667
Let him go! Don’t take him away!

433
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:56,480
He is Lize Palace’s disciple.
Let him go?

434
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:59,359
- And let you kill him?
- Why would I kill him?

435
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,470
You are the only one I want to kill!

436
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,716
You are killing him with your heart.

437
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:06,199
Nonsense!

438
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,660
This is all

439
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,986
your fault.

440
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,915
I’m going to kill you!

441
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,258
Si Feng.

442
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,459
Si Feng!

443
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,633
Si Feng!

444
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,485
Why, Si Feng?

445
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:35,942
Tell me why you did this, Si Feng.

446
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,060
Tell me.

447
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,950
Leave!

448
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,763
I don’t want to see you anymore!

449
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,106
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

450
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:19,879
I told you that I’ll teach you
how to fall in love with me.

451
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,599
I won’t leave.

452
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,940
Our previous lives are not important.

453
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:25,861
The one in front of me right now

454
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:28,702
is the one I care the most.

455
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,502
You promised me.

456
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:36,375
You said that you won’t lie to me.

457
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,340
I trusted you so much!

458
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,820
Ling Long!

459
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,794
This prosthetic hand is quite nimble.

460
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:42,500
Long time no see.
Do you know how much I missed you?

461
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,359
Do you miss me?

462
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,396
Let go of me!

463
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:53,068
Don’t be afraid.

464
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:56,620
You know that I won’t hurt you.

465
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,612
You are indeed my Ling Long.

466
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:05,099
I love this personality of yours.

467
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,079
What are you doing?

468
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,696
- Let go of me!
- Come here!

469
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,239
- Let go of me!
- Wu Tong!

470
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,060
Stop! I’ll fight you!

471
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,960
Ling Long, are you okay?

472
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:29,879
- I’m fine.
- Ling Long.

473
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,439
Have you forgotten how intimate we were?

474
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,359
Shut up!

475
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,182
I’m going to kill you.

476
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,679
Let go of me!

477
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,239
Ling Long!

478
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,820
Let go of me!
