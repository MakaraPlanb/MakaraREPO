00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,678
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,260
<i>EPISODE 17</i>

3
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,510
Please come in.

4
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,519
Hero Yu, Madam needs to see
you. Please proceed to her chamber.

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,768
Now?

6
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,154
Yes.

7
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,976
Madam is sincere about this.

8
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,767
She said she needs to
discuss something with you.

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,225
Okay.

10
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,507
Please.

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,345
A true gentleman always
strives to improve his knowledge

12
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,816
and his moral standards.

13
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:40,414
With a solemn posture and a
generous heart, it shows his high rank.

14
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:46,079
A true gentleman will
never be forgotten.

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,430
Madam, Hero Yu is here.

16
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,870
You may go now.

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,722
Yes.

18
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,230
Greetings, Madam.

19
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,004
I wonder what’s the matter?

20
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,115
Was my song beautiful?

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,159
Why are you staring at the ground?

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,174
Everyone said that I’m the
most beautiful woman in the world.

23
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:35,085
Look. The flower and I, which
one of us is more beautiful?

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,747
This scent,

25
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,272
it’s the Serpent Perfume
of the Zitong Cult.

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,161
What cult?

27
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:46,592
I don’t know anything.

28
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,171
Madam, where did you get this?

29
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,719
Do you want to know?

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,747
You must promise me one thing then.

31
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:59,679
The wine that you brought
has a potent aftertaste.

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,475
But I can’t manage to recreate
the same taste no matter what I do.

33
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,266
Can you tell me

34
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,719
the secret behind that?

35
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,319
- Let me go!
- Qing Rong!

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,856
- Qing Qi!
- Qing Rong!

37
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,310
- What happened?
- Qing Qi, you came just in time.

38
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,109
I originally wanted him
to teach me how to brew wine,

39
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,679
but he was trying to violate me.

40
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,180
Kill him for me.

41
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,679
If not, I’ll be too ashamed
to live in the world.

42
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,359
Madam, you’re framing me.

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,230
You animal! How dare you
try to violate my wife!

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,449
My lord, I will never
do such outrageous act.

45
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,281
I saw it for myself! How dare you deny it!

46
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,613
Prepare yourself!

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,183
Uncle Dong Fang,
what are you trying to do?

48
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:50,486
He tried to violate my wife!
I’ll kill him no matter what!

49
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,432
That’s impossible! Si Feng won’t do that!

50
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,879
Don’t try to find excuses for him!

51
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
Qing Rong is gorgeous.

52
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,386
Every one of them has been eyeing on her.

53
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:02,181
He was staring at Qing Rong
during the feast.

54
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,835
I knew he was eyeing on her.

55
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,837
But I didn’t expect him
to commit such an audacious act!

56
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,806
- Uncle Dong Fang, calm down!
- My lord.

57
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,511
I’m not willing to argue.

58
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,742
Please think about this in a calm manner.

59
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:19,183
Many disciples of yours

60
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,731
were chased out because
they disrespected Madam.

61
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,362
Who do you think is the problem here?

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,959
My lord, you are always
upright and honest.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,846
But why are you so muddle-headed
and let someone manipulate you

64
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,157
when it comes to this?

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,319
- Qing Rong.
- You believe in him instead of me?

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,241
- No!
- You’re useless to me.

67
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,990
- Never find me again.
- Qing Rong!

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,613
All of you, scram!

69
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,804
Qing Rong, wait for me!

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,279
How did this happen?

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,999
Si Feng, I’ll dress your wound.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,790
- I’m fine.
- Let’s go.

73
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,925
Does it hurt?

74
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:01,559
You would’ve been framed
if I didn’t pass by.

75
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,639
Madam Dong Fang is really something.

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,950
Why was she acting like that?

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,110
You never saw what happened,

78
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,279
yet you said I was framed?

79
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,559
Do you believe in me that much?

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,950
Of course! I know your character the best.

81
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,759
Even if Madam Dong Fang
is really gorgeous,

82
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,884
and you do have feelings for
her, you’ll handle it accordingly.

83
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,115
You won’t commit such audacious act.

84
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,039
Have feelings for her?

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,938
Chu Xuan Ji, it’s
meaningless to me

86
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,270
no matter how beautiful
other women are.

87
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,570
Don’t you understand?

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,390
Is it because disciples from Lize Palace
cannot marry?

89
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,593
You still don’t understand?

90
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:55,039
You removed my mask.

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,830
From now on, I don’t need to
wear any mask anymore.

92
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,719
I’ve broken the rules.

93
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,430
That means I’ve forsaken Lize Palace.

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,073
So,

95
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,750
it’s okay for me to marry someone.

96
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,361
But you said Lize Palace
wanted to disown you

97
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,112
because you broke the rules.

98
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,780
You should return to
Mount Shaoyang with me.

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,910
Why can’t you understand
what I’m trying to say?

100
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,318
If I do return to Mount Shaoyang
with you, what identity will I hold?

101
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,639
You’ll be my friend!

102
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,422
Since young, my father told me that

103
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:36,849
we must help our friends out
as much as possible.

104
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,199
So, he’ll let you stay there.

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,557
Wrong.

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,390
We’ll be peers then.

107
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,595
You’re still wrong.

108
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:47,986
I’m still wrong?

109
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,830
What is it then?

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,159
I know now.

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,769
You’ll join the Shaoyang Sect.

112
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,350
And become one of us.

113
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,879
As long as you join our sect,
you can stay with us officially.

114
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,804
But, you’ll become my junior if you do so.

115
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,079
Clearly, she doesn’t understand
what’s a relationship.

116
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,950
But why was she the only person
who could remove my mask?

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,910
Never mind. Let’s get down to business.

118
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,980
Sit down.

119
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,950
Xuan Ji, seems like we need
to stay here for some days.

120
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,675
We need to solve Lord Dong Fang’s problem.

121
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,231
After that, we can find
Min Yan and Ling Long.

122
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:37,223
Because Lord Dong Fang has been
bewitched by his wife.

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,900
So, it’s true that Uncle
Dong Fang was bewitched?

124
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,359
Yes.

125
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,759
During tonight’s feast,

126
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,919
I gave Lord Dong Fang
the antidote with the Tasteless Wine.

127
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,273
Xuan Ji, your family is
close with Lord Dong Fang.

128
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:56,144
Have you ever heard
of news regarding his wife?

129
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,279
I remember that when I was
young, my father told me that

130
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,839
there was a cult
on Mount Zitong.

131
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,297
They always captured young women
in order to brew their concoctions.

132
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:17,359
That time, Uncle Dong Fang
went to destroy the cult.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,878
And he saved the only surviving girl
in the cave.

134
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,789
He brought her back and made her his wife.

135
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:27,389
If they captured young women,

136
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,420
it’s impossible for the cult
to leave them alive.

137
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:35,497
How could a young and weak
woman manage to survive the ordeal?

138
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,646
You’re saying that...

139
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:41,390
Madam Dong Fang belongs to the cult.

140
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,519
If not, how would she know
how to use the Gu Poison of a cult?

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,159
When someone is bewitched,
they’ll become hot-tempered.

142
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,629
Such impudence!
I have the same rank as your father!

143
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,119
How dare you disobey me!

144
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,918
Why is the wine tasteless?

145
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,549
In the end, they’ll lose all control
and they’ll be manipulated.

146
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,180
The condition will become worse
during a full moon night.

147
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:06,039
In the end, if Madam
casts the last spell,

148
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,355
Lord Dong Fang will become her puppet.

149
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,028
Fuyu Island is in danger.

150
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,179
When will the next full moon appear?

151
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,116
- The day after tomorrow.
- The day after tomorrow?

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,990
You’re finally willing to see me.

153
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,670
Why are you only
willing to meet me

154
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,830
during a full moon night?

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,390
Listen, you mustn’t drink
with someone else next time.

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,017
Tell me if you want to drink.

157
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:48,528
I can accompany you.

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,799
I can drink with anyone I wish.

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,693
If you’re not willing to accompany me,
I can leave right now.

160
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,588
Wait, Qing Rong, don’t joke around.

161
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,959
Why would I do so?

162
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,715
I’ll be very happy whenever
you want to see me.

163
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,026
Stop acting like this, okay?

164
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,670
I’ve prepared some wine for you.

165
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,230
Come, drink it.

166
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,399
Thank you.

167
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,599
Let me play a song for you.

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,013
- You can skip the song.
- No.

169
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:37,324
I feel like playing it right now.

170
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,910
I didn’t know you were

171
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,270
into playing songs.

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,710
There are many things
that you do not know about me.

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,674
That’s right.

174
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,270
We’ve been a couple for so many years,

175
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,470
yet you still remained mysterious.

176
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,790
I first met you

177
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,623
in that cave.

178
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,581
After one glance,

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,110
I knew I couldn’t forget you.

180
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,430
From that day onwards,

181
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:41,598
I swore to the heavens.

182
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,270
You’ll be my most precious

183
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,870
in the world.

184
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,159
What a joke.

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,681
I almost gave up on becoming a cultivator.

186
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:55,032
Even becoming an immortal

187
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,110
can’t compare to the times
when we’re together.

188
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,390
I really think that

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,550
I’m the happiest man in the world.

190
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,790
Because I got to be together with you.

191
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,879
What about you?

192
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,150
Qing Rong?

193
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,350
We were married for more than a decade.

194
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,270
How I wished you didn’t
play your song tonight.

195
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,550
So, you knew everything.

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,788
Uncle Dong Fang was so kind towards you.

197
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,419
Why are you trying to harm him?

198
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,512
Tell me.

199
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,783
Tell me why you’re doing this.

200
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:10,854
If I’m not mistaken, you
weren’t captured by the cult,

201
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,885
you’re the leader of the cult itself.

202
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,039
After your cult was destroyed,
you had no way to escape.

203
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,777
That’s why you pretended to
be pitiful in order to save yourself.

204
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,928
Lord Dong Fang is intelligent.

205
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,639
Maybe he knew the truth all along.

206
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,611
But he still tolerated you.

207
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,602
Why are you trying to harm him?

208
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,030
Qing Rong,

209
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,841
I’ve put down the past.

210
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:36,192
Why can’t you just forget about the past?

211
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,959
What a joke!

212
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,007
You eliminated my entire cult.

213
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,838
How could I forget that?

214
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,519
And you all.

215
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,679
Your so-called righteous sects
had slain many people as well!

216
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,350
Why can’t we do the same thing
when you are doing it?

217
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,558
You are just bullying the weak by
using righteousness as an excuse!

218
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,998
Not only that,

219
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,084
you even locked me up in this island.

220
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,195
I can’t go anywhere.

221
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:11,854
You treat me as your pet.

222
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,675
And you want me to feel grateful for that?

223
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,678
I wanted you to know

224
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,189
how it feels like to have
a fate worse than death.

225
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,519
It’s a pity that you discovered my plot.

226
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,159
But it’s fine.

227
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,182
I had enough of living like this.

228
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,933
You can do anything you want.

229
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,879
Master, let me kill her on your behalf

230
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,464
in order to appease your hatred.

231
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,737
Just let her go.

232
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,161
Qing Rong, no matter
if you believe it or not,

233
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,989
I’ve been keeping you

234
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,150
on Fuyu Island in order to protect you.

235
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,110
I didn’t expect you

236
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,315
to misunderstand me this badly.

237
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,092
Just leave.

238
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,674
I’ve lost today.

239
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,950
You can take my life.

240
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,798
Qing Rong, what are you doing?

241
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,349
You ask me to leave?

242
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,865
I’m homeless now.

243
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,619
Where else can I go?

244
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,479
It’s better if you kill me.

245
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,310
Qing Rong, of course
I’m not willing to let you leave.

246
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:32,875
But you’re suffering here.

247
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,546
How could I force you to stay by my side?

248
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,761
Actually, I’m just worried that

249
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,946
you only care for my appearance.

250
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:49,279
I’m afraid that one day,
when I grow ugly and old,

251
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,525
you’ll be reminded of my true identity.

252
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:54,185
Don’t you understand my love for you?

253
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:57,239
Even if you want me to die,
you can just tell me to do so.

254
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,899
I’m willing to die for you.

255
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,570
I don’t want you to die.

256
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,763
Do you believe this?

257
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,598
I’ll give you the antidote
even if they’re not around.

258
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,670
Of course I do.

259
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,860
Qing Rong, I knew you
still love me, am I right?

260
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,159
Of course.

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,953
I have your child.

262
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:30,279
How could I bear to kill
the father of our child?

263
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,496
- Are you speaking the truth?
- Yes.

264
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,759
I always thought you didn’t like children?

265
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,070
Silly boy.

266
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,875
Qing Rong.

267
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,001
I don’t wish to see them.

268
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:45,032
I only want to be with you alone.

269
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,279
Okay. All of you, leave.

270
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,590
Come.

271
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,724
But...

272
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:06,439
Everyone, I hope you
can keep that a secret.

273
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,096
Uncle Dong Fang, I... I’ve
gotten to the bottom of this.

274
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:13,599
My wife was just pranking me.

275
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,790
It’s not a good thing
if people know about this.

276
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,287
Hero Yu, it was a misunderstanding.

277
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,198
Here, I’ll apologize to you
on behalf of my wife.

278
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,327
Master, Madam almost killed you.

279
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,198
Are you really going to let her off?

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,124
I’ve taken the antidote. I’m fine now.

281
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,359
She’s very pitiful as well.

282
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,270
Moreover, a couple
shouldn’t have any overnight feuds.

283
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,110
You will understand this soon.

284
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,702
You two, just treat it
as if you two haven’t been here.

285
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,999
Lord Dong Fang, don’t worry.

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,454
We won’t tell anyone.

287
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,086
Thank you.

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,479
Lord Dong Fang is still very confused.

289
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,279
Tomorrow, when he feels better,

290
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
we’ll ask for permission
to leave the island.

291
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,150
We’ll find Min Yan and Ling Long
after that, okay?

292
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,719
But, do you think Madam
was really pranking him?

293
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,656
- I don’t think she’s pranking him.
- You don’t know anything,

294
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:17,396
yet you’re not as ignorant as I think.

295
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:20,676
I don’t understand what
she’s trying to do.

296
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,691
Does she love or hate Uncle Dong Fang?

297
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,614
She wants him to live,
yet she wants him to die.

298
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,773
Uncle Dong Fang is pretty weird as well.

299
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:32,580
He wants her to leave,
yet he wants her to come back.

300
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,847
A relationship is between two persons.

301
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,518
It’s hard for outsiders
to understand what’s going on.

302
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,199
If you get into a relationship,
you’ll experience both good and bad.

303
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,639
Sometimes, it’s sweet.
Sometimes, it’s bitter.

304
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,113
It’s unpredictable.

305
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:47,959
I think Uncle Dong Fang is quite pitiful.

306
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,897
Madam Dong Fang was evil.

307
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,780
But he’s still trying to protect her.

308
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,479
Even the kindest person
will be disliked by someone.

309
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,667
Even the most evil person
will be loved by someone.

310
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,359
As long as they’re willing,
they won’t think they’re pitiful.

311
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,587
Instead, they’ll feel satisfied.

312
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,940
Anything that has to do
with feelings is difficult.

313
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,571
It’s more difficult than my training.

314
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,870
I don’t want to encounter
something as troublesome as that.

315
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,291
Si Feng?

316
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:26,571
Si Feng, why are you standing here?

317
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,416
I was thinking that the
night scenery is beautiful.

318
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,512
I heard that Lord Dong Fang has hidden
some top-grade Flower Wine.

319
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:40,599
Why don’t we steal some of them?

320
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,559
Steal? It’s not good to steal.

321
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,839
But why not?

322
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,751
We did him a huge favor.
Stealing some wine isn’t a big deal.

323
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,823
- You have a point. Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

324
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:54,328
What a pity.

325
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,096
Dong Fang Qing Qi almost became my puppet.

326
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:01,207
But the two rascals spoiled my plan.

327
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,054
That Yu Si Feng, he was
actually unfazed by my beauty.

328
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,725
And I didn’t expect him

329
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,433
to recognize my bewitching spell.

330
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,727
We don’t have much time.

331
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,318
I can only think of other ways.

332
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,034
Don’t tell me you’re going to leave?

333
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,842
You promised me that
you’ll leave with me.

334
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,571
And that

335
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,350
you’ll leave with our child too.

336
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,870
So many flower petals!

337
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,910
They’re so beautiful!

338
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,996
Xuan Ji.

339
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,992
Si Feng!

340
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,430
This vat of wine smells the best.

341
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,696
It’s so fragrant!

342
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,910
This Flower Wine was just brewed.

343
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:45,701
We must let it settle down
before we drink.

344
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,432
Si Feng, I knew you were the best.

345
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,903
You can overcome any obstacles
in the world.

346
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,479
Actually, there is one thing
I cannot overcome.

347
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,830
Are you willing to help me out?

348
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,551
Your affairs are my affairs.

349
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,702
How can I help you?

350
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,959
The thing that’s been troubling me

351
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,970
is hidden within
the bottom of this wine jar.

352
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,702
You’ll see it after
we finish the wine.

353
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,359
I heard that the sea view
on Fuyu Island is great.

354
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,839
Why don’t we enjoy some wine by the sea?

355
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,590
Sure. Let’s go.

356
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,470
Yu Ning? Pian Pian?

357
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,388
How could the two of you do this?

358
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:30,593
That’s the only jar of
freshly brewed Flower Wine.

359
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,239
And you got to it first.

360
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,799
How about we share the wine?

361
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,759
Sure. Si Feng, we won’t
drink it by the sea then.

362
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,119
Let’s drink it in the wine cellar.

363
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,879
We came without notice.
Are we interrupting you guys?

364
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,230
Of course.

365
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,919
Not at all. The more, the merrier.

366
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,150
Si Feng, let’s go.

367
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,620
It’s meaningless if we drink it like this.

368
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:02,159
Why don’t we play Rock Paper Scissors?

369
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,439
What do you think?

370
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,503
Sure. But we need to lay down the rules.

371
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:07,679
Those who win can take one sip.

372
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,519
Those who lose can only stare in silence.

373
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,407
I’ll definitely take the first sip.

374
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:14,737
Me first.

375
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,030
Si Feng won.

376
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:22,779
Si Feng, that’s enough!

377
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,130
You’re more of an alcoholic than me.

378
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,150
You finished

379
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,190
half of the wine in one sip.

380
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,087
- Who’s next?
- Me.

381
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,670
Si Feng won again.

382
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,184
You!

383
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,484
Take it easy.

384
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,672
Although the Flower Wine
is sweet when you drink it,

385
00:24:57,673 --> 00:24:59,303
it has a huge kick.

386
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,590
You’re something.
There’s only a little bit left.

387
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:08,992
I’ll play with Xuan Ji next.

388
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,045
Sure.

389
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,359
I won!

390
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,676
You won.

391
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,910
It’s mine now.

392
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,239
You drink it.

393
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,239
Oh no, the words have
become solid inside the wine jar.

394
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
They can’t be removed.

395
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,174
<i>You don’t know that I fancy you.</i>

396
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:35,201
But I won the match.

397
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,952
That wine is mine.

398
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,622
The moonlight is intoxicating indeed.

399
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:44,333
I can’t drink this.

400
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,150
There’s a heart inside. Look.

401
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,532
It’s true.

402
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,799
There’s a heart indeed.

403
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,165
Xuan Ji, look.

404
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,830
There’s nothing inside though.

405
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,510
I don’t see anything.

406
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,599
Let’s go. We didn’t manage to drink.

407
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,990
- I’m tired now. Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

408
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,839
Why are you leaving?

409
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,950
Si Feng, why are they leaving?

410
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,103
It’s good that they’re gone.

411
00:26:38,104 --> 00:26:39,639
Troublemakers.

412
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,999
Si Feng, are you drunk?

413
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,070
I’m not drunk.

414
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,279
You’re the one who’s drunk.

415
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,270
Me? I haven’t had one sip.

416
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,599
It’s all because of you.

417
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,046
Dumb Xuan Ji.

418
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,489
Okay, I’m dumb.

419
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,389
You’re drunk. We should return early.

420
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,741
Come.

421
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,560
You’re not allowed to go.

422
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,310
My problem hasn’t been solved yet.

423
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,550
What problem?

424
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,150
You are

425
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,714
my problem.

426
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,664
Xuan Ji,

427
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,550
you always ignore everything

428
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,430
and try to drill yourself into my heart.

429
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,950
You make me feel uneasy.

430
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,590
And I always dream about you.

431
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,498
Tell me.

432
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,084
What should be your punishment?

433
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,479
You feel uneasy?

434
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,430
And you always dream about me?

435
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,622
Si Feng, I haven’t seen you
for four years.

436
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:01,399
I always dreamed about you too.

437
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,672
Does this frustrate you?

438
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:07,885
You feel that way as well?

439
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,710
You don’t need to answer me yet.

440
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,750
Listen to my heart.

441
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,910
You can answer after that.

442
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,232
Why is his heart beating so fast?

443
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:33,903
Don’t tell me he’s sick?

444
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,791
This...

445
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,242
Si Feng,

446
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:51,832
why is your heart beating so fast?

447
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,270
Are you sick?

448
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,319
Let’s find a physician.

449
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,670
There’s a window on top.
We can exit from there.

450
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,390
Si Feng.

451
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,310
Si Feng.

452
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,839
Si Feng.

453
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,350
Why are you ignoring me?

454
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,225
Speak to me.

455
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,520
What are you doing?

456
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,424
Xuan Ji,

457
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,317
you should know that

458
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,110
you need to be responsible for me

459
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,110
once you removed my mask.

460
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,470
I removed your mask, of course
I need to be responsible for you.

461
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,446
Is that so?

462
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,519
It’s too fragrant.

463
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,230
Si Feng, this...

464
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,679
What’s wrong with you?

465
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,510
The flowers are too fragrant.

466
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,910
They’re irritating my nose.

467
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,319
Smell this.

468
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,750
Smell this. Isn’t it fragrant?

469
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,470
- Am I right?
- It’s pretty fragrant.

470
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,223
Stop fooling around!

471
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,076
You’re bad!

472
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,669
Chu Xuan Ji,

473
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,007
do you know what this is?

474
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,152
Si Feng, you drank too much.

475
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:30,890
This is Fuyu Island’s Love Stone.

476
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:33,999
It fell from the heavenly realm
a few hundred years ago.

477
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,996
As stated in the books,

478
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:41,319
if two person who are
fated to be together approach this stone,

479
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,350
the stone will glow.

480
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,798
What has it got to do with us?

481
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,150
I want to try this with you.

482
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,359
It’s fake. Stupid rock.

483
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,199
I’m going to smash it.

484
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,039
Si Feng, don’t do that!

485
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,319
This belongs to Fuyu Island.
We shouldn’t touch it.

486
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,461
Just ignore the stupid rock.

487
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:44,959
It’ll be bad if someone saw you.

488
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,837
Hurry, let’s return.

489
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,529
Let’s go.

490
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,696
Si Feng.

491
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:03,786
Si Feng, you’re awake?

492
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,379
Here’s some hangover soup.
You should drink it.

493
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,683
I’ll drink it by myself.

494
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,354
It’s fine.

495
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,949
What sound is that?

496
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,679
I think someone came to the island.

497
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,226
Is it Ling Long and Sixth Senior?
Let’s have a look.

498
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,476
Vice Palace Lord?

499
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,469
What a coincidence.

500
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,270
Greetings, Vice Palace Lord.

501
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,990
What did I say before you leave?

502
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,832
Our lord has such
high expectations for you.

503
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,320
But the mask couldn’t hold you down.

504
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:19,391
You found a way to remove the mask.

505
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,199
The little girl is all grown up now.

506
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,559
I almost couldn’t recognize you.

507
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,439
You’re so lucky.

508
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,774
Did she remove the mask for you?

509
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,239
Are you going to blame Si Feng again?

510
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,961
I removed the mask.
It has nothing to do with him.

511
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:37,952
You should come at me.

512
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,112
Miss, you’re not from Lize Palace.

513
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:43,183
I don’t dare to approach you.

514
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,719
But, did you really
remove the mask?

515
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,099
Of course.

516
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,160
Yu Si Feng, I want to congratulate you.

517
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:57,110
You’re the first person who managed to
remove that mask in Lize Palace.

518
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,326
What do you mean by that?

519
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,912
Si Feng was injured. I was afraid
something might happen to him.

520
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,602
That’s why I removed the mask.

521
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,790
Good. Very good.

522
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,248
There’s an old rule in Lize Palace.

523
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:18,230
If someone can remove that mask,
Lize Palace will not try to make him stay.

524
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,750
Yu Si Feng, seems like
this is your happy ending.

525
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,028
But, you need to return
the mask to Lize Palace.

526
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,979
You need to give an explanation
to the palace lord.

527
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,582
Where’s the mask?

528
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,927
Vice Palace Lord, I lost the mask
while I was fighting the Purple Fox

529
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,710
in Mount Gao.

530
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,839
You lost it?

531
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,594
What is this then?

532
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:57,152
The mask is crying.

533
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:00,810
That means your curse
hasn’t been dispelled.

534
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,119
That’s a different story.

535
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,712
Yu Si Feng, you should return
and explain it to our lord personally.

536
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:09,043
Vice Palace Lord,

537
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:12,159
I still have many questions
left unanswered.

538
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,844
Please give me more time.

539
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:15,875
I will try to solve everything.

540
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,477
Sorry, Xuan Ji.

541
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:29,364
I can’t accompany you
to find Ling Long and Min Yan.

542
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:33,150
Wait here. Those from Shaoyang Sect
will pick you up.

543
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:36,342
You mustn’t go on your own.

544
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:39,122
Must you return?

545
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,823
I’ll follow you then.

546
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,374
I’m worried about you.

547
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,559
This is my personal matter.

548
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,423
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

549
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,170
I’ll surely return for you.

550
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,912
Xuan Ji,

551
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,890
let me tell you a secret.

552
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,910
It’s really difficult to be a human.

553
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,040
But you...

554
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,390
You’re the reason why
I’m willing to become one.

555
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,259
Ruo Yu, return with Yu Si Feng.

556
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,570
Yes.

557
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,154
Wait.

558
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,688
What else?

559
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:49,119
Listen, I’ll pick up Si Feng
at Lize Palace in a few days.

560
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,518
Miss, don’t you know
the rules of Lize Palace?

561
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,450
No women are allowed in Lize Palace.

562
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:57,071
I’ll wait outside then.

563
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:02,183
And I want you to promise me
that Si Feng won’t be harmed.

564
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,678
Don’t think that everyone in Lize Palace
has a mild temper.

565
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,850
Yu Si Feng is a disciple of Lize Palace.

566
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:12,334
Anything he receives
has nothing to do with you.

567
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:14,517
I’m not as mild-tempered as Si Feng.

568
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,399
If you can’t promise me that,

569
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,576
- Si Feng will stay behind.
- Stay behind?

570
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:21,372
On what basis?

571
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:24,261
Do you know what you need to do
after you remove the mask?

572
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,999
I know. I need to be responsible for him.

573
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,296
I removed the mask.
I’ll be responsible for him.

574
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:31,158
How? Tell me.

575
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,589
You need to marry him.

576
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:35,385
Are you willing to do so?

577
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,343
Vice Palace Lord!

578
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,007
I need to marry him?

579
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,518
So, Si Feng meant we must get married?

580
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:45,002
So, that’s the problem.

581
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,871
It’s my fault.
I didn’t understand him completely.

582
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:50,222
Miss Chu looks unhappy with that.

583
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:54,639
I agree.

584
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,063
If marrying him is the only way
for him to escape punishment,

585
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,772
I’ll marry him.

586
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,905
Si Feng, you’ve done so much for me.

587
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,684
It’s okay.

588
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,115
I can do this for you.

589
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,359
Miss Chu,

590
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,220
if you do so willingly,
the mask will become a smiling mask.

591
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,891
But it’s not smiling.

592
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,841
Stupid mask! I’ve agreed to marry him!
Why aren’t you smiling?

593
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,813
- You’re not doing it willingly.
- Nonsense!

594
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:32,239
Vice Palace Lord, please
give Xuan Ji and I some time.

595
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,976
I’ve given you ample time.

596
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,337
Take him away.

597
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,912
Don’t touch him!

598
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:50,691
I don’t understand.

599
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,158
How could you let a mask
decide someone’s fate?

600
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,519
That’s the dumbest rule
I have ever heard of.

601
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,590
Today, I’m going to
destroy this stupid mask.

602
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,979
The mask was made by the bark
of the Kunlun Tree. It’s tough.

603
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,770
How could she destroy it
without any effort?

604
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:13,951
Dingkun Sword?

605
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:16,039
Why does she have the Dingkun Sword?

606
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,430
Now that the mask is gone,
you have no way to punish Si Feng.

607
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,385
The mask was destroyed.

608
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:28,119
That adds another level
to Yu Si Feng’s misdeeds.

609
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,042
I won’t let you take him away!

610
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:32,909
What? Are you trying to attack me?

611
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,230
Xuan Ji, calm down.

612
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,219
You’ve offended me too many times.

613
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,826
Don’t blame me for
disrespecting your father.

614
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:47,743
You’re just a mantis.
How dare you try to stop a cart!

615
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,213
Brace yourself!

616
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,990
Vice Palace Lord!

617
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,603
Xuan Ji!

618
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,364
Xuan Ji?

619
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,003
Spell of Tranquility, calmness
among all else, return to tranquility.

620
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,601
Xuan Ji!

621
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:51,555
Vice Palace Lord,

622
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:53,718
what exactly happened?

623
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:56,352
You actually ignore your status
as an elder

624
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:58,559
and fought against your junior.

625
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,479
Sect Leader Chu’s daughter

626
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,730
forced me to release Si Feng
with the Dingkun Sword in her hand.

627
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:06,721
I was taken aback.

628
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,359
Are you talking about the divine weapon
which fell into the human realm?

629
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,839
Vice Palace Lord, you misunderstood her.

630
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,537
That sword was given to her by my master.

631
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:23,639
Although it’s made from rare materials,

632
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,159
- it’s not a divine weapon.
- That’s right.

633
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,370
Xuan Ji’s cultivation is just ordinary.

634
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:31,401
I’m sure she won’t be able to
master a divine weapon.

635
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,823
Fine.

636
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,154
You already said it.

637
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,079
I’ll treat it as my mistake.

638
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,299
Okay, let’s skip that.

639
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,933
We should get back to business.

640
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:44,599
Everyone knows that the Destiny Pearl
is in my hands now.

641
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,241
But the disciples that I’ve sent to
Xuanyuan Sect haven’t returned yet.

642
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,919
No one knows exactly what happened.

643
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,644
The most important thing now is
the spirit key within the Destiny Pearl.

644
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,650
Spirit key?

645
00:43:58,377 --> 00:44:00,759
Why am I in the dark?

646
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,321
Vice Palace Lord, we’re in a plight.

647
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:06,830
I hope everyone can be honest
and don’t hide anything from each other.

648
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,348
1,000 years ago, the heavenly realm
sent four spirit keys

649
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,319
to the four righteous sects.

650
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,973
Fuyu Island, Lize Palace,
Xuanyuan Sect, and Dianjinggu Sect.

651
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:19,252
Each sect holds one spirit key.

652
00:44:19,253 --> 00:44:21,479
And they’re hidden within
each sect’s treasure.

653
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,995
According to Xuan Ji’s news, Sky
Hall knew about that fact long ago.

654
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,866
And they’re aiming for our spirit keys.

655
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,650
Yes.

656
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,556
After all this time, the demons
aren’t weak and feeble anymore.

657
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,786
They’ve become a huge threat.

658
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:41,079
It’s fine if they just want to save
Wu Zhi Qi with the spirit keys.

659
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,150
I’m just afraid that they’re
after something more.

660
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:48,924
I heard that they wanted to
revive the Star of Mosha.

661
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,399
The Star of Mosha?

662
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,265
What a joke.

663
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:55,702
I think it’s impossible as well.

664
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:59,287
The Star of Mosha was vanquished
1,000 years ago.

665
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:00,930
How could they revive it?

666
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:04,361
It’s just their wishful thinking.

667
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,319
But, speaking of which,

668
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,487
we need to be more careful
with the spirit keys.

669
00:45:09,488 --> 00:45:11,278
How about this?

670
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:16,426
We’ll formulate a plan after
Dianjinggu Sect’s sect leader is here.
