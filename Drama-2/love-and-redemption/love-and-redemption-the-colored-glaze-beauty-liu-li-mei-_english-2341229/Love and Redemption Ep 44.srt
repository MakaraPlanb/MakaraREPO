00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,359
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,558
<i>EPISODE 44</i>

3
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,285
The barrier is broken?

4
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,384
Demon Lord, they are sneaking
an attack through a secret tunnel!

5
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:03,319
Lize Palace’s barrier has been broken.
Tear it down!

6
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,020
- Attack!
- Let’s go!

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,599
This is your strategy?

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,519
- No.
- You lured me for a duel

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,980
- but you send someone to sneak an attack?
- No, it’s not like this!

10
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,353
Ninth Heaven Fire?

11
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,997
Xuan Ji and I practice
the Sentimental Tactics together.

12
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,559
Our hearts are one.

13
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,645
And our power is one too.

14
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,593
This Ninth Heaven Fire is nothing.

15
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,439
Today, I’m going to
use your head as gift and

16
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,614
your demonic core as tribute
in me and Xuan Ji’s wedding

17
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,173
while we bow to heaven and earth!

18
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,436
Dream on!

19
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,757
Hurry up! Follow the palace lord’s order
and retreat into Lize Palace!

20
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,797
You want to run? Chase after them!

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,347
Senior Hao Chen!

22
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,220
Yu Si Feng, what are you trying to do?

23
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,159
What am I trying to do?

24
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,335
In the past, I thought that cultivators
are conservative and adhere to rules.

25
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:27,359
You really shocked me by showing
me how cunning you can get.

26
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,519
Lize Palace is just defending ourselves.

27
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,444
If you don’t retreat now,

28
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,039
don’t blame me for activating
the Golden Bell

29
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,660
and crushing them to dust.

30
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,799
There’s no point in making a deal
with these demons!

31
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,085
Xuan Ji, don’t care about us.

32
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,542
Go in and kill the Star of Mosha.

33
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,052
Kill every demon in Lize Palace!

34
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:52,959
So touching that Sect Leader Hao Chen
is willing to die for the sake of a cause.

35
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,679
Fine.

36
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,891
Bring it on.

37
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,965
Let’s see if these disciples

38
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,022
will be able to pave the path
for you towards victory.

39
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,170
God of War, Sect Leader Hao Chen is right.

40
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,020
To be able to sacrifice for this cause,
it’ll be a worthy death.

41
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,313
Sect Leader Chu,
let’s use this chance to go in.

42
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,005
We have to kill the Star of Mosha.

43
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,241
But...

44
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,411
The price that we have to pay is too high.

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,349
Okay.

46
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,795
I agree to retreat from Lize Palace.

47
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,159
No, Xuan Ji.

48
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,851
As the sect leader, I don’t agree!

49
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,900
God of War, how can you cower
in time like this?

50
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,588
I’m not cowering.

51
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:52,294
Valley Master Rong,
we are talking about people’s lives here.

52
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:55,706
Dianjinggu’s disciples are in here too!
They are not bargaining chips.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,628
Senior.

54
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,925
You always say that
we have to protect the people.

55
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,479
Who are the people?

56
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,341
Every life matters.
We can’t just sacrifice them!

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,919
I’ll retreat.

58
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,446
Let them go.

59
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,910
I promise that all of us
will retreat from Lize Palace.

60
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,291
Xuan Ji!

61
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,319
Okay, we’ll each take a step back.

62
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,519
This Golden Bell is set by Elder Luo
using the four mythological objects.

63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,879
I’ll bring those mythological objects
to open it.

64
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,934
I hope that you’ll keep your word.

65
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:32,101
Don’t worry.

66
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,546
I hope that this time,

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,089
you won’t lie to me again.

68
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:38,890
Okay.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,599
Palace Lord,
we can’t forgive those people.

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
What do you want me to do, Elder Luo?

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,779
Do you want to force them

72
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,453
to break into Lize Palace and
fight it out for a brief satisfaction?

73
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:56,905
Palace Lord.

74
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:59,711
You should ask what those cultivators did.

75
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,140
Palace Lord,
take a look inside the palace.

76
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
Elder He, your injuries...

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,620
Who cares about that?
My injuries are nothing.

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,726
Why don’t you look at

79
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
these young disciples?

80
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,821
They can’t be saved anymore.

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,319
Palace Lord.

82
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,599
When those cultivators came in
from the secret tunnel,

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,639
they passed our children’s school.

84
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,107
The disciples inside are just young kids
who can’t even use their neigong.

85
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,771
But because they are demons,
they were killed without mercy.

86
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,139
They are all killed by the same person.

87
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,599
Samadhi Fire from Yaohua sword moves.

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,660
This is the doing of Hao Chen.

89
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:20,058
- Elder Luo.
- Palace Lord.

90
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,540
Give me the four mythological objects
at once.

91
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,279
Are you still going to compromise?

92
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,799
Elder Feng is repairing the barrier now.
We just need to delay them for a while

93
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,906
- and they won’t be able to come in.
- No.

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,815
I want to let Hao Chen out

95
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,498
and kill him with my own hands

96
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,712
to avenge these disciples.

97
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,679
These mythological objects
belong to our sects at first.

98
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,173
But now, everything is theirs.

99
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:54,319
God of War, are you really
going to keep your promise?

100
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,622
Now is the best chance for you to go in.

101
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,914
I will not break my promise.

102
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,085
I won’t force my way inside.

103
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,399
And I won’t let others do the same.

104
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,804
Xuan Ji.

105
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,277
The demon clan is
especially cunning and unreliable.

106
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,795
Even if you keep your promise,
the Star of Mosha might not.

107
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,980
He has been gone for so long.

108
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:23,218
I’m afraid that he’s going to play
some tricks on us. We better be careful.

109
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:25,107
Father.

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,420
He has no need to lie to me this time.

111
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,639
You want to talk about trust with a demon?

112
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,079
Just you watch.

113
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,192
Let’s see if Yu Si Feng
will break his promise again.

114
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:40,653
He always likes to use
your kindness against you, right?

115
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:42,366
Have you forgotten about that?

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,262
Yu Si Feng.

117
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,243
Have you brought
the four mythological objects?

118
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,267
Yes.

119
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,322
I’m sure that you are
very familiar with them.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,935
I don’t need to introduce them to you.

121
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:21,879
Yu Si Feng, what are you doing?

122
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,894
Hurry up and remove the other barriers.

123
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,035
Who said that I’ll remove them?

124
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,599
Yu Si Feng,
why did you break your promise?

125
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,462
Break my promise?

126
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:46,279
You are the one who know about
the secret tunnel and brought them in.

127
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,417
Do you know the name of the sword when
four mythological objects are combined?

128
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,859
It’s called the Hell Raiser Sword.

129
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,500
This sword can slaughter
demons and ghosts in hell.

130
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,359
And it can kill evil people
in this world too.

131
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,996
Hao Chen.

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,059
Today, I’m going to
kill you with this sword.

133
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:15,958
Yu Si Feng, you broke your promise again!

134
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,139
Is there anything real that comes out
from your mouth?

135
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,690
He deserves to die!

136
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,531
Xuan Ji.

137
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,517
I’ve said that you can’t trust him.

138
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:31,713
Hurry up and use the Sentimental Tactics
with me to kill him!

139
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,540
<i>LIZE PALACE</i>

140
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,739
Yu Si Feng, you are going to die under me
and Xuan Ji’s Sentimental Tactics today!

141
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,987
Si Feng!

142
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,999
Are you really going to kill me?

143
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,319
Sentimental Tactics.

144
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,768
Xuan Ji! You..

145
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,820
Yu Si Feng!

146
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,001
Senior!

147
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,112
Senior!

148
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,573
Master!

149
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,002
Silver Snake!

150
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,796
Yu Si Feng.

151
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,621
Since the beginning until now,

152
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,034
I’ve trusted you wrongly.

153
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,908
From now on,

154
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,923
there will be no ties between us.

155
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,940
How is it, Si Feng? Do you feel better?

156
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,399
Let me take a look at your wound.

157
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,152
No need to take a look at it.
Isn’t he the Star of Mosha?

158
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:16,659
This kind of injury is nothing to him.

159
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,896
You are great, Star of Mosha.

160
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,290
How is it possible that
you are the Star of Mosha?

161
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:32,781
Although I can’t see your future,
I still have a rough idea about it.

162
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,399
If you are the Star of Mosha,

163
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,579
I’ll dig out my celestial eye now
and swallow it.

164
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,269
Enough.
Stop glaring at me, Brother Liu.

165
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,301
At first, I didn’t want to lie to you.

166
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:46,805
I just thought of some ways to make them
believe that I’m the Star of Mosha.

167
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,989
I did it just to foil Yuan Lang’s plan.

168
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,439
Next, I still need your help
for my next plan.

169
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,614
You are playing with fire.
You will get burnt one day.

170
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,183
Don’t worry, I’m tough.

171
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,281
I see.

172
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:03,614
When you were fighting with Xuan Ji
outside of Lize Palace just now,

173
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,999
didn’t you tell her that
you are the fake Star of Mosha

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,659
and tell her about your plan?

175
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,719
Yuan Lang is the one who lured
the three sects here.

176
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,622
Yuan Lang was trying to test my identity.
I couldn’t tell her about it.

177
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:19,540
At first, I wanted to explain
everything to her slowly.

178
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:23,307
But...

179
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,991
Forget it. Let’s not talk about it.

180
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,668
There are still many seriously
wounded disciples in Lize Palace.

181
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,782
- I’ll have to trouble you again.
- Don’t worry.

182
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,197
I’ll go and check on them now.

183
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,554
- What about your...
- Just some minor wounds. I’m fine.

184
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,933
Brother Liu, why are you
looking at me like that?

185
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,780
I really don’t understand.

186
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,197
You did so much for Chu Xuan Ji.

187
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,559
I want to see whether
it’ll all pay off in the end

188
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,988
or you’re going to fall into the abyss
and turn to dust.

189
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,932
What are you talking about?
I don’t understand.

190
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,740
Stop pretending, okay?

191
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:29,315
Why would you suddenly want to
pretend as the Star of Mosha?

192
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,919
It must be because that person
appeared by your side and

193
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,703
you wanted to hide her identity for her.

194
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,195
Besides Xuan Ji,

195
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:38,959
who else will you sacrifice so much for
without a care for your own safety?

196
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,551
Ever since I first met her,
I already know that she’s not that simple.

197
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:45,604
I couldn’t even see her past or future
with my celestial eye.

198
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:49,706
I just never thought
that she is the Star...

199
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,412
Don’t breathe a word about it.

200
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,943
Brother Liu, if you
speak so freely again,

201
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,999
don’t blame me for breaking
my friendship with you.

202
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,509
Yu Si Feng.

203
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,850
You are using our friendship
to threaten me?

204
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,519
You are still protecting her?

205
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,254
She doesn’t even know about
the things you did for her.

206
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:16,914
She will just hate you and detest you.

207
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,372
Did that stab from her sword hurt?

208
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:24,893
Did it hurt?

209
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:28,589
And there’s the Loveless Curse too.

210
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,433
Brother Liu, you are hurting me.

211
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:44,517
I’m fine.

212
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:47,389
Although Xuan Ji hates me and detests me,

213
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,050
she still couldn’t hurt me in the end.

214
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,395
Little Phoenix.

215
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,359
You can’t just gamble with your luck.

216
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,439
You managed to stop the activation of
the Loveless Curse this time.

217
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,559
What about next time?

218
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,372
Do you know that everything you do

219
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,705
will only put a bigger and bigger wedge
between you and Chu Xuan Ji?

220
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:10,689
What are you going to do the next time
she misunderstands and hurts you again?

221
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,021
How many times can you hold back
the Loveless Curse?

222
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,362
Will you be able to survive until the end?

223
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,478
Don’t worry.

224
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,759
I won’t let the Loveless Curse
be activated again.

225
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,954
Everything is within
my expectation.

226
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,520
If it’s really within your expectation,

227
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:38,732
you wouldn’t lose your focus
and get stabbed by her.

228
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,349
Yu Si Feng.

229
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,027
Since the beginning until now,
I’ve trusted you wrongly.

230
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,453
From now on,

231
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,180
there will be no ties between us.

232
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,420
She said that

233
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,386
she’ll break all ties with me.

234
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,045
She didn’t hesitate when she attacked me.

235
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,574
I didn’t manage to dodge her attack.

236
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,090
When I find the right time in the future,

237
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,519
I’ll explain it to her.

238
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,140
She will understand.

239
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,292
Little Phoenix.

240
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,729
I treat you as my friend.

241
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,311
If it was another person,
nobody would care about you.

242
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,239
There are things that you have to
think about it yourself.

243
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,954
I feel terrible when I look at you.

244
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,015
I’ll go and help out Ting Nu now.

245
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,906
Come out.

246
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:51,715
Master.

247
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:54,326
I once asked you to vow that

248
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:58,245
no matter what,
you are not allowed to harm Xuan Ji.

249
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,577
But you hurt her.

250
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,221
Yes.

251
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,000
I disobeyed your order.

252
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,468
My heart is suffering right now.

253
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,444
But I don’t care.

254
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,651
That Chu Xuan Ji deserves to die.

255
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,206
Unfortunately,

256
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,559
she’s the God of War.

257
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,392
I’m just a Silver Snake.

258
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:25,233
I’m not her match.

259
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,021
Master.

260
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,052
I am your spirit beast.

261
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,039
If she hurts you, I’ll kill her!

262
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,733
Even if I’ll lose my life
doing it, it’s still my mission!

263
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,835
Okay.

264
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,271
I can’t control you now.

265
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,970
You became my spirit beast
out of a coincidence back then.

266
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,313
You are able to take
the form of human now.

267
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,733
It’s time to set you free.

268
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,551
- Master.
- Today, I’ll snap my arm

269
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:02,956
to break my blood contract with you.

270
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:05,035
The world is big.

271
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,500
There will be a place for you.

272
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,449
Silver Snake.

273
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,671
Silver Snake, what are you doing?

274
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,885
Release me now.

275
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,512
No.

276
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:47,140
Master, no.

277
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,628
I don’t want to be your spirit beast
a long time ago.

278
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:55,680
But I can’t watch you die.

279
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,679
Master.

280
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,942
Master.

281
00:23:00,183 --> 00:23:01,609
Master.

282
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,758
Silver Snake, what are you doing?

283
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,251
Remove your hand.

284
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,616
Remove your hand! Silver Snake!

285
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,385
Silver Snake.

286
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:26,449
Remove your hand.

287
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,562
Silver Snake!

288
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,738
Don’t be like this.

289
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:34,834
Silver Snake.

290
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,499
Master.

291
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,618
I’ll leave on my own.

292
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,489
Master.

293
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:54,157
When you call for me again in the future,

294
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:59,037
when you summon Silver Snake
again, I won’t be coming back anymore.

295
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,226
Our blood contract is not yet broken.

296
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:08,104
You’ll just hurt yourself by doing so.
Do you know that?

297
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,596
I don’t care about that.

298
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:15,763
Master.

299
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:23,706
Because the one I care about

300
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,027
is Yu Si Feng.

301
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,981
Yu Si Feng is my bottom line.

302
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:34,741
Master.

303
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:37,670
Goodbye.

304
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,239
- Palace Lord.
- Elder He.

305
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,079
Why are you so seriously hurt?

306
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,639
I remember that you were just
shot on the arm with Demon Bow.

307
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,377
There’s Bone-Melting Poison on his wound.

308
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:52,044
The poison must have been applied
to the Demon Bow.

309
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:55,213
Although the wound
looks normal on the outside,

310
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:58,399
the poison will enter the body
and corrode the organs.

311
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,333
Such a cruel poison.

312
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:03,679
These sects are more cruel
and vicious than us demons.

313
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,513
How dare they say that they are righteous?

314
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,301
- Then, this poison...
- Don’t worry.

315
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,644
I can neutralize it.

316
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,478
I’ll have to trouble you again.

317
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,533
It’s nothing.

318
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,830
Who is he?

319
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:21,519
Liu Yi Huan.

320
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,159
The abandoned disciple of Lize Palace
is here right on time.

321
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,461
Are you the one who betrayed

322
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:30,606
the information of our secret tunnel
to those sects?

323
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:34,304
You are good at diverting attention from
yourself when you are the perpetrator.

324
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:37,841
Aren’t you the one who
put Lize Palace in danger?

325
00:26:43,742 --> 00:26:48,212
You took the Black Feather
Medallion and used my name

326
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,473
to send a declaration of war
to those sects.

327
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,599
You brought war upon us when
we should’ve been recuperating.

328
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
We’ve suffered heavy casualties
because of you.

329
00:26:58,293 --> 00:26:59,644
Do you dare say that

330
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,342
you are innocent?

331
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:05,359
This...

332
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,014
Why did vice palace lord...

333
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:09,244
I want to know why too.

334
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,332
Maybe Right Lieutenant

335
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,134
doesn’t believe in my capability
as the Star of Mosha

336
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,237
and my ability to lead the demon clan.

337
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,221
Is that why you gave me a test?

338
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,692
Or is it because

339
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,913
you are dissatisfied that I’m leading
Lize Palace and Sky Hall?

340
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:27,948
So, you purposely lured God of War here
during the enthronement ceremony

341
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:32,239
for her to kill me for you so that
you can reap the benefit from it?

342
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,279
Yuan Lang.

343
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,072
What are you trying to do?

344
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,559
Don’t be mad.

345
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,999
All I want is just to revive
the glory of us demon clan.

346
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,125
You are our leader. You are
the savior and hope of demon clan.

347
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:47,599
Why would I try to kill you?

348
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,381
But we put in so much effort
to get the spirit keys.

349
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,735
So, I just wanted to make sure.

350
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:54,926
Besides that,

351
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:56,949
in the past,

352
00:27:57,484 --> 00:28:00,877
you left our clan and Lize Palace
for the God of War.

353
00:28:00,878 --> 00:28:01,996
I...

354
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,724
I just want to make sure
that nothing will go wrong.

355
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,556
You are indeed good at
using pretty words to your advantage.

356
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,250
You are really innocent in this matter.

357
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,519
But no matter what, you shouldn’t
use our clan’s safety as a bet.

358
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,165
And you shouldn’t have let
our disciples sacrificed for nothing!

359
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,037
You are right.

360
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:24,013
I was too inconsiderate.

361
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:26,013
I promise that it’ll not happen again.

362
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:30,838
If you don’t trust me, you can
enter the Demon Citadel with me.

363
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,758
There’s no need to drag this on.

364
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:34,694
But

365
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,421
you are not from the demon bloodline.

366
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:41,242
You’ll be affected by the malignant aura
if you enter the Demon Citadel.

367
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,199
Forget it.

368
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,900
Just decide now.

369
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:54,279
How about we depart right
away once you’ve recovered?

370
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,411
I’ll hand over the spirit keys to you when
we reach the outside of Demon Citadel.

371
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,941
Then, the four elders and I will lead
the whole Lize Palace

372
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:05,782
to stay guard outside
for your protection

373
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:07,799
and to celebrate your success.

374
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,955
Okay.

375
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,079
With Ting Nu here to treat me,

376
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,540
this minor wound will only
take me two days to recover.

377
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,003
Please get everything ready by then.

378
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,727
After two days, we’ll depart.

379
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,998
Yes, Demon Lord.

380
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,999
Uncle He Yang, how is Senior Hao Chen now?

381
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:38,644
The sword that pierced him
is made up of mythological objects.

382
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,850
It’s very powerful.
So, he’s seriously injured now.

383
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:43,917
I think he’ll have to
rest for quite a while.

384
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:46,064
Can I go in and visit him then?

385
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:47,639
He

386
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,220
- Doesn’t want to see you.
- I...

387
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,318
Then, I’ll wait for him here every day.

388
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,679
Xuan Ji.

389
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,020
Even if you wait for him here
every day, he won’t want to see you.

390
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,759
Yu Si Feng,
why did you break your promise?

391
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,940
Break my promise?

392
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:28,796
You are the one who know about
the secret tunnel and brought them in.

393
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:32,397
They are just demons.

394
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,519
What’s wrong with killing demons?

395
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,984
Senior Min Yan.

396
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:40,129
Senior Min Yan, finally, I found you.

397
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,277
You were practicing the New Triplets
of Yaohua sword moves last time.

398
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:45,026
It was so beautiful.

399
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:47,764
I’ve practiced a long time
based on my memory.

400
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:49,479
But I can’t get it right.

401
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,645
Can you teach me?

402
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:55,454
I was just fooling around.
Nothing to learn from me.

403
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:57,039
You better learn your basics first.

404
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,253
That New Triplets
are cohesive and magnificent.

405
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:02,599
How can you say that
you were fooling around?

406
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,965
I’ll practice here and you
can just take a look at it.

407
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,519
Enough. You can’t practice that
New Triplets yet.

408
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,021
You can’t be impatient with Shaoyang’s
sword practice. Take it step by step.

409
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,725
Most importantly, you have to have
a clear heart and mind.

410
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:42,312
Go now.

411
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,067
When did you come here?

412
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,158
I was just looking for you.

413
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,778
You were practicing sword
with Junior Wen Xuan?

414
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,717
I met her by chance.

415
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,199
So, I gave her some advices.

416
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,359
Don’t think too much.

417
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,057
I didn’t think too much.

418
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,628
Junior Wen Xuan is smart and
has a good personality.

419
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:33,129
Everybody likes her.

420
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,743
Most importantly,
she has a clear heart and mind.

421
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,695
She’s different from me.

422
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:42,079
Do you have to twist my words?

423
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,959
Do you have to speak of
yourself like this?

424
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,508
No.

425
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,132
I was just thinking that

426
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,300
we shouldn’t torture ourselves
like this anymore.

427
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,861
I’m not the Chu Ling Long
whom you’ve once known.

428
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:57,457
I lived with demons in the past.

429
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,354
I committed grave sins.

430
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,846
I’m not worthy for you to like me anymore.

431
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,251
Torture each other?

432
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,775
Ling Long, I really don’t understand.

433
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:14,624
When did your relationship
become like this to you?

434
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:16,838
I beg you.

435
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,212
Can you stop assuming my thoughts for me?

436
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:21,785
Ling Long.

437
00:33:21,786 --> 00:33:24,439
What can I say?
How can I assure you?

438
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,285
What should I do to make you understand?

439
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,601
Didn’t we agree that everything
is already in the past?

440
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,021
Isn’t ’everything is in the past’

441
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:36,242
the greatest lie of all?

442
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,196
Everything has already happened.

443
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,399
Nobody will ever forget about that.

444
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,775
You don’t know that

445
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,460
you are the only one

446
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:53,421
who still live in that abyss.
You wouldn’t forgive yourself.

447
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,152
You wouldn’t trust me.

448
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,270
What else

449
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,169
can I do?

450
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:33,796
I can’t find it.

451
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,700
The scrolls of the
Asuras should be here.

452
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,148
But no matter how I dug for it,

453
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,045
I can’t find the records of
that Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

454
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:02,305
This smell

455
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,819
is the incense that King Bailing
always uses in his study room.

456
00:35:07,894 --> 00:35:13,009
King Bailing reads about the
information on the demon clan as well?

457
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,511
Could it be that I missed it just now?

458
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,615
I found it.

459
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,500
Mosha?

460
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,079
No.

461
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,581
This is the record on God of War.

462
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,934
King Bailing read about it too.

463
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,069
This is strange.

464
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,415
They said that God of War
killed Star of Mosha.

465
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,906
But why isn’t it recorded here?

466
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,719
Why is the origin of the God of
War not recorded inside this scroll?

467
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,540
Could it be that King Bailing
kept it for himself?

468
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:40,839
- Is the road of enemies narrow or...
- No.

469
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,039
I came here to find you
when I smelled you.

470
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,007
My little obedient Flying Snake.

471
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,639
What are you doing lately?

472
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,967
I couldn’t even sense you at all.

473
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:52,457
Tell me. Where did you go?

474
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:59,253
I didn’t go anywhere.

475
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:01,046
I was just sleeping inside here.

476
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,788
- You’ve been here all along?
- Yes.

477
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,079
This place is nice.

478
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,799
Old Guy knows how to enjoy himself best.

479
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,368
Siming Hall is quiet and cooling.

480
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,603
When I wake up, I just need to
take a scroll and I’ll have a story.

481
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:17,024
I’ve been reading about this lately.

482
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,960
<i>ILLUSTRATION OF FOUR SACRED BEASTS:
GREEN DRAGON</i>

483
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,893
What is it?

484
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,084
You’ve been reading this?

485
00:37:38,085 --> 00:37:39,345
Me?

486
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,577
I never thought that
you admire me so much.

487
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,490
Wrong!

488
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,959
I was just curious.

489
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,832
Here. Open it and take a good look.

490
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:56,879
Look at you in the past
and look at you now.

491
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,559
Look at it and reflect on yourself.

492
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,043
How did you become such a mess?

493
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,319
You are still drinking tea
so leisurely here.

494
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,982
You want to enter the Demon Citadel?

495
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,404
Come. Tell me.
How are you going to enter it?

496
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:29,599
- You are not the Star of Mosha.
- So,

497
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,798
I need the knowledgeable Brother Liu
and Ting Nu to think of a solution for me.

498
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:37,160
I have to survive in the Demon Citadel
so that my cover will not be blown.

499
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,195
So, you are not the Star of Mosha.

500
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,509
Little Si Feng.

501
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,261
When did you learn how to lie?

502
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,118
You even lied to me.

503
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:56,670
Who is Star of Mosha then?

504
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,401
How would I know?

505
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:02,219
But this identity is quite useful.

506
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,359
Little Si Feng.

507
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,183
You are indeed a good boy
that is courageous and smart.

508
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:13,482
Now, I have even more confidence in you.

509
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,660
Little Si Feng, I want to enter
the Demon Citadel with you.

510
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,582
I’ve used 1,000 years
to try to save Wu Zhi Qi.

511
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,141
I can’t sit out during
this critical moment.

512
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:31,119
Okay.

513
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,638
Hide outside of the Demon Citadel then.

514
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,789
When the seal of Demon Citadel is broken,
use that chance to get in.

515
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,970
Just make sure that
Yuan Lang won’t sense you there.

516
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,476
Hold on.

517
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,719
You are serious?

518
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,383
You really want to enter Demon Citadel?

519
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,023
Do you think that
the Demon Citadel is a fun place?

520
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,119
Malignant aura swirls around inside it.

521
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,863
It’s full of malignant spirits of Asuras
that have lost their minds.

522
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:59,009
You are not from the demon clan.
You’ll die inside.

523
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:04,333
I can prepare some medicine for you

524
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,719
to help you recover from
the attack of malignant aura.

525
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,999
But it can only relieve it for a moment.

526
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,486
I don’t know how long it’ll last.

527
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:13,497
Okay. That’s enough.

528
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:17,948
With my 12 Feathers and her
1000-year-old cultivation, we’ll manage.

529
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,011
- Thank you.
- Why are you thanking him?

530
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,220
- Why are you such a busybody?
- I...

531
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:26,273
Little Phoenix, you’ve already
thought it through, right?

532
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:27,959
Are you really going to release Wu Zhi Qi?

533
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,159
Will he help you if you release him?

534
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,479
Of course he’ll help Little Si Feng.

535
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,828
Wu Zhi Qi is a person
who can distinguish kindness and hatred.

536
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:37,174
By saving him,
he’ll be indebted to Little Si Feng.

537
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:39,183
Wu Zhi Qi will definitely pay him back.

538
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,156
So, you’ve made up your mind.

539
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,732
Fine. I can’t control you.

540
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,999
I don’t care anymore.

541
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,110
If you want to go, go ahead.
Good luck.

542
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,639
But you have to be
careful after you go in.

543
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,953
Keep calm.

544
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:11,901
Any movement will wake
the malignant spirits of Asuras inside it.

545
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,419
Don’t die inside there.

546
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:15,307
Okay.

547
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,469
Don’t worry, Brother Liu.

548
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,228
No matter how adverse the situation is,

549
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,149
I’ll come out from it alive.

550
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,173
Senior.

551
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:25,999
I’m here to visit you.

552
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,959
Today is the fifth year since you
brought me to Xuyang Peak to train.

553
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,133
If you still won’t talk to me,
I’ll stay here.

554
00:41:33,134 --> 00:41:35,279
I’m a nobody.

555
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,844
I’m not worthy enough to be
the senior of God of War.

556
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:40,676
It’s too much for such
a powerful being to visit me.

557
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,233
Go back.

558
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,100
- Senior.
- Leave.

559
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,912
Senior, your injury...

560
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,381
Let me treat you.

561
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,768
I don’t need it.

562
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,863
You don’t really care about me anyway.

563
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,639
No need to force yourself.

564
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,148
It’s not like that.

565
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:03,428
I went to your room
every day to ask for you.

566
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,279
I’m always worried about your injuries.

567
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,042
I’ve never forgotten about you
for even a day.

568
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,006
What about Yu Si Feng?

569
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,429
I...

570
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,432
Have you let go of him yet?

571
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,540
Looks like you haven’t.

572
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:25,546
Since the Sentimental Tactics
has been broken,

573
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,039
we can’t practice it anymore.

574
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,757
And our master dream
will never be fulfilled.

575
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,155
But in your heart,

576
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,072
you still can’t let go of
that devil, Yu Si Feng.

577
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,826
I promise you.

578
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,797
Next time... When I see
him again the next time,

579
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,262
I won’t be lenient anymore.

580
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:51,298
Next time?

581
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,822
Will you be able to do it next time?

582
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,956
I just need some time.

583
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:04,242
Okay.

584
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:08,265
Tell me then.

585
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,878
How long do you need?

586
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,656
It’s going to take you forever, right?

587
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,584
Xuan Ji.

588
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,744
You are just going to turn into
a demon just like him.

589
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:24,621
Have you forgotten about the grudge
for your mother and your master?

590
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,319
Have you forgotten about
Auntie Ying Hong’s injuries?

591
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,669
He lied to you again and again
and yet, you want to give him time.

592
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,917
What is it?

593
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,846
Are you hoping that he can do more evil

594
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,660
or do you hope that
he can hurt more of us?

595
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,687
I’m the one who worry and care about you.

596
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,517
I am the one who are
destined to marry you.

597
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:50,119
But why?

598
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,100
Why are you so obsessed with
a devil that lied to you again and again?

599
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:59,188
Do you think that
you still have a lot of chances?

600
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,427
There is no more chance, Chu Xuan Ji.

601
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:06,893
You have only this one chance.

602
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,284
And I have only this one chance as well.

603
00:44:11,503 --> 00:44:13,069
Senior.

604
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,570
What is the meaning of this?

605
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,980
What I mean is,

606
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,981
Yu Si Feng has become your demon.

607
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:29,479
If you can’t defeat this demon,
you’ll sacrifice everything.

608
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,685
Forget it.

609
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,660
If you are not willing to
avenge your master,

610
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,275
I’ll do it.

611
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,823
I’ll do it myself.

612
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,026
Senior!

613
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,878
Don’t be like this.

614
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,711
I’ll go.

615
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,695
Wait.

616
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,529
Where are you going?

617
00:45:01,254 --> 00:45:02,680
Lize Palace.
