00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,619
<i>EPISODE 56</i>

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,439
Yu Si Feng.

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,543
It’s been three days now.

5
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,680
You came so early.
Are you here to admit defeat?

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
I just want Xuan Ji to see
everything that belongs to us.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,920
No matter what your game is,
it’s all but useless.

8
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,160
Xuan Ji and I once planted a tree
that looked exactly like that.

9
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,400
It was blooming with blue blossoms
and covered with wind chimes.

10
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:23,614
Those notes contained our feelings.

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,280
I wrote down
everything from memory.

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,880
So much time has passed, I didn’t expect

13
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
that I’ve never forgotten any one of them.

14
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
I’ve told you, what you’re
doing is totally meaningless.

15
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,640
Chu Xuan Ji is already gone.
Give it up!

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,599
Is that true?

17
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
Why can’t you take another look then?

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,911
You’re afraid
that you can’t confine Xuan Ji anymore.

19
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:06,191
Do you think you can seal everything?

20
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,039
Xuan Ji is right here.

21
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,559
She can hear me talking to you.

22
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,672
She remembers everything.

23
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:12,960
Do you remember

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,480
that you love blue flowers the most?

25
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,320
Blue flowers?

26
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
Xuan Ji.

27
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,719
I remember.

28
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,240
And I remember that my favorite wine
is the Flower Wine from Fuyu Island.

29
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,815
Xuan Ji, is that you?

30
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,149
You’re back?

31
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,759
Come back to me quickly!

32
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Don’t be ruled by Star of Mosha’s soul!

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,131
I don’t know.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,440
Can you see me through his eyes?

35
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,640
Xuan Ji.

36
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,040
I can see you!

37
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
I can!

38
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,160
Si Feng.

39
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,646
Tell me quickly.
What else do I like?

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,399
Xuan Ji!

41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
Xuan Ji!

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,719
You like dessert.

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,479
You like the fragrance of flowers.

44
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,759
You like the moonlit night in Shaoyang,
and all the places we’ve visited together.

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,040
We’ve agreed to spend
the rest of our lives in utopia.

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,479
Right.

47
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Utopia.

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,879
Is the Rose Gold Bird clan
hiding in utopia too?

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,479
- Where are they?
- In the swamp of Longshan Village.

50
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Where exactly in that swamp?

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
You’re not Xuan Ji!

52
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,479
Yu Si Feng, oh, Yu Si Feng.

53
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,999
You truly love her deeply.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,400
You fall for this trick every time.

55
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:31,519
I just didn’t expect you
to come to your senses so soon.

56
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,440
But I’ve asked almost everything.

57
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Rose Gold Birds are
in the swamp of Longshan Village.

58
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,159
You actually used hallucination spell to
worm facts out of me?

59
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,399
How could you call yourself Demon Lord?

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
You’re so despicable
to break your promise!

61
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,279
It’s already seven o’clock.

62
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,222
Three days have passed.

63
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,519
Your Chu Xuan Ji didn’t appear at all.

64
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,111
I’ve kept my word

65
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:02,990
and only used hallucination spell on you
after seven o’clock.

66
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,239
Accept the defeat, Yu Si Feng.

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
All your childish memories,
and pitiful love

68
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,559
are petty and insignificant in my eyes.

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,079
- They are worth nothing.
- You’re lying!

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Xuan Ji clearly responded.

71
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,239
The eyes can’t hide it.

72
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,599
It’s Xuan Ji.

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,360
Xuan Ji is affecting you.

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,959
I’m Rahu Ketu, the Lord of Demon Citadel.

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,759
No one can stop me even if
I were to destroy the world.

76
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,999
Do I need to lie to a pest like you?

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,070
Even if this primordial spirit
was in love with you

78
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,959
when it became Chu Xuan Ji, so what?

79
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,159
So what if she pledged eternal loyalty
to you before?

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,040
She was just playing along.
It’s entirely unreal.

81
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:52,999
She didn’t understand in the past.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,471
Now that she has all my memories,

83
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:58,959
she’ll know that those sincere love,
and eternal promises

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,200
are the biggest joke!

85
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,010
Why don’t you believe it
from the beginning?

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
What have you been through?

87
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,679
Yu Si Feng,

88
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
do you think the piece of memory
left in Chu Xuan Ji’s primordial spirit

89
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,559
will allow you to do as you wish
without costing you your life?

90
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,640
Fine. I’ll show you
the price you’ll pay for offending me.

91
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
Xuan Ji.

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,039
Si Feng! Let go of him!

93
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,239
Let go of him!

94
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,880
Don’t hurt Si Feng!

95
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,160
Let go of him!

96
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,800
I forbid you to hurt Si Feng!

97
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,920
Let go of him!

98
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,920
Let go of him!

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,959
Let go of him!

100
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,319
Rahu Ketu!

101
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,640
I won’t let you hurt Si Feng!

102
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,359
Let go of him!

103
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Did you hear that?

104
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
Si Feng!

105
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,600
Xuan Ji!

106
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,560
Si Feng!

107
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
Xuan Ji!

108
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,040
Si Feng!

109
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,616
Leave here quickly!

110
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,359
We promised to stay inseparable!

111
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,032
How could I abandon you?

112
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,960
Don’t be so foolish!

113
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,119
Xuan Ji!

114
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
Get lost!

115
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,880
Rahu Ketu,

116
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,679
you lost.

117
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,439
Xuan Ji has always been here.

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,680
She appeared.

119
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,560
I told you, you can’t kill me.

120
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
Xuan Ji will never let you kill me.

121
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,119
I only showed you mercy,
and spared you your life because you saved

122
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,519
my primordial spirit many times before.

123
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,680
However, don’t take my kindness
as your bargaining chip.

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,279
I’ve sealed your meridians.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,359
Before I find the Rose Gold Bird,

126
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,920
you better stay in the Demon Citadel.

127
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,711
Chu Xuan Ji, are you going
to put away thousands years

128
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,879
of hatred and humiliation we’ve suffered?

129
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,399
I don’t want to kill anyone.

130
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,559
I don’t want all life to live in misery.

131
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,319
And I want Si Feng to be well.

132
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Yu Si Feng again.

133
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,134
Do you want to be with him so much,
and refuse to part with him?

134
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,919
- Do you really believe in this?
- Yes!

135
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,007
I believe in Si Feng!

136
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,560
Have we not suffered enough in the past?

137
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,279
Didn’t we use to believe
in friendship, our friends

138
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,239
and the people we loved?

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,999
But what happened in the end?

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,799
What did we go through?
What did we get?

141
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,679
Trust me.

142
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,326
Stop resisting me.

143
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,639
I’m doing this for our sake.

144
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,320
I’ll make everyone who
hurt us pay the price for it.

145
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Hurry and let Xuan Ji out!

146
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
Barging in my chamber?

147
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,479
Do you really wish to die?

148
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,999
Xuan Ji, do you not
recognize us anymore?

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
We’re your family.

150
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Family?

151
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,639
I, Rahu Ketu, have lived for over
10,000 years.

152
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,822
You mortals only live for several decades.

153
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:47,039
How dare you say such things?

154
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,399
Since you once
took care of my primordial spirit,

155
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,640
I’ll spare all your lives today.

156
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,640
Get lost!

157
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:58,159
Xuan Ji, you can hear us, right?

158
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,919
Even though you’ve become Rahu Ketu,
I believe you still have your memory.

159
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,359
You lacked six senses when you were a kid.

160
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,679
It was me, Father, Mother,
and Min Yan who stayed by your side.

161
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,997
Nothing has changed now!
We’re still here for you!

162
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:12,559
Xuan Ji, Auntie Ying Hong and
Uncle He Yang are missing you too.

163
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,678
Everyone is waiting for you to return.

164
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,359
Xuan Ji, you’ve lived for
so long, but in this lifetime,

165
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,960
our consanguinity can’t be changed.

166
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
I’ll always be your father.

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,239
So noisy!

168
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,878
What family? What friendship?

169
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,422
They’re all displeasing sounds.

170
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,886
Since you like talking about love so much,

171
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:40,239
I wonder which is more important
to you, your love or your lives?

172
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,111
Xuan Ji, I know it’s you.

173
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,559
Before your mother died, I’ve promised her

174
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,159
to take good care of you forever.

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,759
You’re not good at expressing
yourself, but you have a kind heart.

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,879
I know your mother was right.

177
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,759
Come back.

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,360
You shouldn’t be like this.

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,680
Come back.

180
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,440
I, Rahu Ketu, will never stop.

181
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,799
The heavens sowed the seed of bitterness,

182
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,479
they’ve to bear the consequences.

183
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,199
I don’t want to waste my time killing you.

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
Stop annoying me.

185
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,279
This is the Core Fire.

186
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,919
Take it back and set up a barrier with it.

187
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,806
When Transcendent Furnace is overturned
and fire from heavens descends to earth,

188
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:42,120
this Core Fire can resist the
fire from heavens and protect you.

189
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,151
You can’t kill me, nor can you kill them.

190
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,710
Actually, you’ve all the love inside you.

191
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:05,191
Even if you deny that you’re
Xuan Ji, she can still influence you.

192
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,599
Illusion.

193
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,719
It’s just an illusion.

194
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,439
The heavens wanted me to undergo
10 lifetimes of tribulations,

195
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,400
so that the illusion of mortal love
can eradicate my hatred.

196
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,239
All of you

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,079
are simply pawns of the heavens.

198
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,479
Only if I burn away all the
illusion can the heavens know that

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,199
Rahu Ketu isn’t Chu Xuan Ji.

200
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,639
The grudge in my heart can’t be
eradicated by the so-called love.

201
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,000
I refuse to be a pitiful worm like you who
allows the heavens to shove you around.

202
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,439
Would you be happy then?

203
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,759
You simply changed from being
manipulated by the heavens

204
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,839
into being controlled by hatred.

205
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,439
Rahu Ketu, why can’t
you let go of your hatred

206
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,839
and see who you really are?

207
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Let go of hatred?

208
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,879
You can’t even let go of Chu
Xian Ji, what right do you have

209
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,048
to make me forget the hatred
that is buried deeply in my bones?

210
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,280
Yu Si Feng, do you
what the God of War is?

211
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,360
Do you know how I got my body?

212
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,879
I’ll show you.

213
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,759
Tell me if I can let go of this hatred?

214
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,680
Should I let it go?

215
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,400
The scars...

216
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
How did you get them?

217
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,120
Who did this?

218
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,176
It was Bailing.

219
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,760
King Bailing?

220
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,880
I thought Bailing was a bosom friend that
I would never find again,

221
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,279
so I trusted him completely.

222
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,479
I didn’t care about the difference
between deities and demons.

223
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,720
I would often drink wine with him at
the white pagoda by Ruoshui Pond.

224
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,520
And then...

225
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,039
The Demon-Immortal War began.

226
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,039
I thought our friendship
could bridge the war.

227
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,880
But never had I expected him
to intrigue against me and harm me!

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Yu Si Feng, I’ll show you what
kind of a person he is right now!

229
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
Feel free to drink.

230
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,262
The heavens and demon clans
are waging war.

231
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,174
I’m afraid there’ll be less chances

232
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:01,520
for me to drink with you, Brother Ketu.

233
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,679
I was wondering why you’re in a bad mood.

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,000
So, it turns up you’re worried about this.

235
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,199
Asuras are skillful in battle,

236
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,599
so the celestial troops
were instantly defeated.

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,119
At this rate, the heavenly palace
will be invaded before long.

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,039
The crux of the problem is that
the heavens doesn’t have someone like you

239
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,080
who is invincible enough to protect us.

240
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:33,399
It’s not my intention to see devil and
demon clans waging war on the heavens.

241
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,047
Unfortunately, the grievances
have accumulated over the years

242
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,439
and can’t be removed overnight.

243
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,279
But I was thinking, if you
marry a woman from my clan,

244
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,414
perhaps it can help mitigate the war.

245
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:46,879
And a woman from my clan can assist you
in protecting the heavens forever.

246
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,086
No.

247
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,879
Gods and demons are enemies.

248
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,600
How can the heavens be united
with demon clan through a marriage?

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,119
Gods and demons are enemies?

250
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,000
Then, why did you invite me
for a drink and befriend me?

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,959
Brother Ketu, you’re different from
other demons.

252
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Among all the demons in the world,
you’re the only one that I’ll befriend.

253
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,959
Judging from the current
situation, I wonder how much longer

254
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,720
we can drink together like this.

255
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,799
The three realms are so big
that it’s hard to find a bosom friend.

256
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,839
I’m willing to drink
and talk to you every day.

257
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,560
Is that true?

258
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,199
We’re friends.

259
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
Don’t you trust me?

260
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:52,750
I’m just afraid that once
the heavens is conquered,

261
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:55,759
the three realms will descend into chaos.

262
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,840
All the gods and deities won’t
be able to escape from their doom.

263
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,662
You need not worry about the war.

264
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:09,360
I brought good news for you.

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,840
Something is wrong with the wine.

266
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
What do you mean?

267
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,039
Brother Ketu,

268
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,800
didn’t you just say you want to
drink and talk with me every day?

269
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,680
Unfortunately,

270
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,252
you’re Asura after all.

271
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,360
That makes me uneasy.

272
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,159
But if I can completely
turn you to my side,

273
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,440
then only I can rest easy forever.

274
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
What did you say?

275
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,960
I’m sorry, Rahu Ketu.

276
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,080
I’m

277
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,440
only doing this for the sake of
the heavens.

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,440
Brother Ketu,

279
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,254
you shouldn’t have woken up so soon.

280
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,935
We’re friends.

281
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,053
The current situation
won’t look good for you.

282
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Since you’ll forget everything soon,

283
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,879
I won’t hide it from you.

284
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,879
I’ll change your entire appearance

285
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,360
so that you can make a clean cut
from the past.

286
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,320
You’ll transform into a new person.

287
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,319
No one will ever be able to recognize you.

288
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,439
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,479
Didn’t you want to
drink and talk to me every day?

290
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,630
It’s the only way to fulfill your wish.

291
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,280
This is

292
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,060
best for all of us.

293
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,400
These two weapons made from
demonic bones are too vindictive.

294
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:55,160
I’ll remove it for you and find
you another weapon in the future.

295
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,599
My king, the Jade Emperor has ordered

296
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,119
you to release Rahu Ketu immediately.

297
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,719
Even if I’m willing to,
I’m afraid it’s too late now.

298
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,159
Go back and report to the
Jade Emperor that I’ll definitely

299
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,120
build an upstanding God of War
for the heavens.

300
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,639
Brother Ketu, I’m going to use
this Jade Cup to seal your soul.

301
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
Lie down.

302
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
Take a rest.

303
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,079
Rahu Ketu, you’ve no heart now.

304
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,081
I’ll use the corner of the jade
as your heart.

305
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:07,360
All your six senses will be gone.

306
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,880
You’ll be at my disposal.

307
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,839
Now, you’re no longer
Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu,

308
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,440
but the God of War of the heavens.

309
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,519
Starting from tomorrow,
you’ll serve for the heavens,

310
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,640
wipe out all Asuras and
slaughter Demon Citadel.

311
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,959
Who exactly are you?

312
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,600
I am the God of War!

313
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
I was once kind and affectionate,

314
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,400
yet I was met with heartless betrayal.

315
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,279
I didn’t want to
massacre, but Bailing

316
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,840
tore up my bone and turned me
into a murder weapon.

317
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,359
I longed for peace and harmony,

318
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,920
but Bailing manipulated me
into killing my clanmates.

319
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
Yu Si Feng,

320
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,320
tell me,

321
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,960
should I not hate?

322
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,120
Should I not seek revenge on the heavens?

323
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,120
The thing planted in my
chest is just a corner of a jade.

324
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
It can’t contain all your feelings.

325
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,239
The 10 lifetimes of tribulations,
and reincarnation of the God of War

326
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
have nothing to do with me.

327
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:12,960
Because

328
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,600
I’m a heartless person anyway.

329
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,560
Xuan Ji, I’m sorry

330
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,320
that you’ve to suffer in agony all alone.

331
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,800
Had I known earlier,

332
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
I would’ve stayed and talked with you.

333
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,760
I won’t let you become like this.

334
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,280
I’m sorry.

335
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,560
How many times have I told you?

336
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,439
I’m not Chu Xuan Ji,
and I don’t need your sympathy.

337
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,719
My soul has returned now.

338
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,239
There’s no Chu Xuan Ji, and Yu Si Feng.
There’s no one!

339
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,800
All I have are hatred and vengeance.

340
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,079
No.

341
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,560
No matter how much you hate, I
know there’s still a trace of love.

342
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,223
Yu Si Feng, if you don’t
stop this endless bickering,

343
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:39,680
I’ll wipe out Chu Xuan Ji
and your memories from my mind.

344
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
Xuan Ji,

345
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:51,040
I’ll rescue you for sure.

346
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,800
Even if I have to die,

347
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:59,640
I won’t let you continue to
live in Rahu Ketu’s hatred.

348
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,800
Don’t panic, it’s me.

349
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,759
Flying Snake, why have you come?

350
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,120
I’m here to stop you from doing
anything stupid.

351
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,359
- What do you mean?
- I know

352
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,999
you want to ask the white bird to
send a message to your clanmates

353
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,039
and tell them to hide.

354
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,759
But you’re digging your own grave.

355
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,719
Demon birds are at Yuan Lang’s command.

356
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,055
If you pass the letter to white bird,
Yuan Lang will get it within half a day.

357
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:35,039
But Rose Gold Birds are in danger,
I’ve to send them a message.

358
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,960
If you trust me enough,
let me help you then.

359
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,280
After all, the heavens doesn’t want
Rose Gold Bird to be found.

360
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:53,286
And also, do you want to rescue Xuan Ji?

361
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:55,560
I do. Do you have any plans?

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
I overheard the conversation
between the King and Vermilion Bird.

363
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,999
They wanted to pour the juice of
Tianying Grass made by sorcerer

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,760
into Rahu Ketu’s wine
to make him faint for a while.

365
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,999
Then, they’ll take a drop of his blood

366
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,840
and put it into the Jade Cup
as a catalyst to reseal Rahu Ketu’s soul.

367
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:13,119
When they were distracted,

368
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,079
I stole the Jade Cup and the juice
of Tianying Grass.

369
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,879
If you really can seal Rahu Ketu’s soul,

370
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,279
the stinky woman will come back.

371
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Is that true?

372
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,639
I’ve tested the juice anyway.

373
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,879
Other than making Asura faint for a while,

374
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,439
it has no other toxic effects.

375
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,872
If so, why don’t we try it?

376
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,960
Perhaps we can really rescue Xuan Ji?

377
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,279
Si Feng, I don’t want to see the
stinky woman being controlled by Rahu Ketu

378
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,947
and do anything immoral.

379
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:43,278
I’ll leave these to you.
Whether to use them or not,

380
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,000
Si Feng, it’s up to you.

381
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,960
Kneel!

382
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,639
Palace Lord!

383
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,319
Elder Luo.

384
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,999
Palace Lord!

385
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,279
- Elder Luo.
- Palace Lord, it’s that darn Yuan Lang who caught us.

386
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,840
How could this happen?

387
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,919
How could I find them so quickly, is it?

388
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,079
Yu Si Feng, I’m also
a Rose Gold Bird.

389
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,159
Of course I know where in the vast swamp

390
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,047
is most suited for Rose Gold Birds.

391
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:37,280
As expected, I found
every one of them.

392
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,119
You’re also a Rose Gold Bird, why
are you so cruel to your clanmates?

393
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,839
My clanmates are nothing,
the demon clan is more important.

394
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,360
What’s wrong in prioritize
what’s most important?

395
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,559
Your meridians are sealed,
yet you dare to fight me?

396
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,000
You’ve such unruly hands, - I’ll cut them off for you!
- Stop!

397
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,079
Yu Si Feng is my personal demon slave.

398
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,560
If you dare to hurt
him, I’ll kill you.

399
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,639
Demon Lord, Yu Si Feng
saw that I captured the Rose Gold Birds

400
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,959
and wanted to fight with me.

401
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,440
That was why I...

402
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,159
Even if my demon slave wants to kill you,
you can’t touch him

403
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,199
without my order.

404
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,799
Understand?

405
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,719
Yu Si Feng, come back with me.

406
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,319
Rahu Ketu, these
are my clanmates.

407
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,519
They’ve nothing to do with
what happened back then!

408
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,639
If you sacrifice them to avenge yourself,

409
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,960
how are you any different from Bailing?

410
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,999
I tip Transcendent Furnace
to rebuild three realms

411
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,719
not only for revenge, but also
to reset the rules in three realms.

412
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,336
In contrast with this, the Rose
Gold Birds’ lives are trifling.

413
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,759
Whether you’re sad or resentful,

414
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,640
I’ll not change my mind for a demon slave.

415
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,399
Yuan Lang, pass my order.

416
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,199
Tomorrow morning,
all the demons shall assemble.

417
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,319
We’ll attack the heavens again.

418
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,560
Yes.

419
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,199
Rahu Ketu, tonight
is my last chance.

420
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,999
For the sake of my clanmates,
for the sake of stopping you,

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,560
for the sake of Xuan Ji,
I’ve to reseal your soul.

422
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,655
Do you know how I got my body?

423
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:27,839
I’ll show you.

424
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,159
Tell me whether this
hatred can be forgotten?

425
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,040
Should it be forgotten?

426
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,399
I thought Bailing was a bosom friend
that I would never find again,

427
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,079
so I trusted him completely.

428
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,320
But never had I expected
him to intrigue against me and harm me.

429
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,959
You’re an Asura after all.

430
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,080
That makes me uneasy.

431
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,320
But if I can completely
turn you to my side,

432
00:32:56,896 --> 00:33:01,520
then only I can rest easy forever.

433
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,200
Do you think a god can enter Demon Citadel
unnoticed by me?

434
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,839
I knew each and every of
Flying Snake and your move.

435
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,039
But I’m curious,

436
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,999
the only chance to save Rose Gold Birds
is right before you,

437
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,959
why did you choose to give up?

438
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,759
I do want to save my clanmates,

439
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,120
but for the sake of justice in
three realms, I can’t do that.

440
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,599
You’re very lucky.

441
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,639
If you really put a drop of my blood
in the Jade Cup,

442
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,600
the situation would be so much worse.

443
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,760
You don’t get it?

444
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,119
Fine.

445
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,160
I’ll show you what exactly is
inside the Jade Cup.

446
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,318
It’s the Golden Flame
in Transcendent Furnace.

447
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:24,199
It was sealed within Zhongtian Palace,
for the fortune of all life.

448
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,640
It loses power once it leaves the palace.

449
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,199
But there’s one exception,

450
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,368
which is to use Asura’s blood
to break the seal.

451
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,591
Bailing deliberately let Flying Snake
overhear the conversation

452
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:38,959
and tricked you into getting my blood

453
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,999
in order for Golden Flame
to explode in the mortal realm.

454
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,254
Just now, if you’ve used my blood,
and dropped it into the Jade Cup,

455
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:48,760
then we would’ve burnt into ashes now.

456
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,830
I’ve never expected
that as the ruler of the heavens,

457
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,920
Bailing is so malicious.

458
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,639
With things as such, you should
agree for me to attack the heavens

459
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
and seek revenge on them, right?

460
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,560
No.

461
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,320
The actual culprit behind
all of this is Bailing himself.

462
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
The other deities have no idea.

463
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,903
If you want to seek revenge,
you only need to aim at Bailing.

464
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:20,880
You don’t have to involve all beings.

465
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:24,039
I want to find him,

466
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,039
but how is it possible that
such a shameless person

467
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,799
will have the audacity to meet me alone?

468
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,560
He must be hiding behind all the deities,
and plotting another scheme right now.

469
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,679
Yu Si Feng, he’s the one
who involved all beings, not me.

470
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,919
I will go to the heavens to find
Bailing and persuade him to meet you.

471
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,965
You?

472
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,799
I want to help you.

473
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,359
If I succeed, you can get what you want
without going to war with all the demons.

474
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,078
If I fail,

475
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,199
it’s only a few days of delay for you
to attack the heavens.

476
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,880
You have nothing to lose.

477
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,000
You’re doing this for me
to release Chu Xuan Ji, right?

478
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,440
That’s right. If this is done, you
can’t confine Xuan Ji anymore.

479
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:14,159
Make it happen before you
use it as your bargaining chip.

480
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,800
Okay. That’s settled then.

481
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,720
Aren’t you afraid Bailing will get angry,
and kill you?

482
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:25,880
If that’s the case,

483
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:29,960
I’ll only have myself to blame
in seeking my own doom.

484
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,760
Rahu Ketu, please
give me a chance.

485
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,760
Give all the beings
in the three realms a chance.

486
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:39,722
Fine,

487
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,840
I promise you.

488
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:46,959
If you can’t get back alive,
I’ll fight my way to the heavens

489
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,759
and pull out Bailing’s tendons one by one

490
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,880
to weave a Soul Gathering Flag for you.

491
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,559
Bailing, my demon
slave would like to see

492
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,639
if you have any courage left to meet me

493
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,742
after being so shameless and despicable.

494
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,119
Be well prepared.

495
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,360
Don’t disappoint him too much.

496
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,559
My king, so you
purposely tricked me.

497
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,759
You wanted to trick Si Feng
into using Golden Flame to kill Rahu Ketu.

498
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,481
Don’t you think
this is too heinous?

499
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:27,240
Whether I had the intention or not,

500
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,599
you’ve colluded with demons anyway.

501
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,759
Flying Snake,

502
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,799
I know you hate to part with
Chu Xuan Ji and Yu Si Feng,

503
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,319
but Rahu Ketu is the most powerful man
in three realms.

504
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,590
I could seal his soul once, but
there’ll never be a second time.

505
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,759
If I want to stop him, I have
to eradicate him completely.

506
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,200
Using their lives to save
the three realms is worth it!

507
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,399
My king, if you want to save three realms,
you can just meet up with Rahu Ketu

508
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,279
- and talk out the grievances with him!
- How insolent!

509
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,279
I am the ruler of the heavens!

510
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,040
Will a murderous demon like him
be worthy enough to see me?

511
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,519
Pass on my imperial order,

512
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,839
from now on,
the heavens shall be on high alert.

513
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,719
Any demon who dares to cross the boundary,

514
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,600
no matter what the reason is,
kill without mercy!

515
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:16,359
Where are you from?

516
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,279
How did you cross Sea of Life and Death
and enter the heavens?

517
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,007
I’m here to see King Bailing.
I need to talk to him.

518
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,398
King Bailing has ordered.

519
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,919
Any demon who dares to cross the boundary
will be killed without mercy!

520
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,580
- Take him down.
- Attack!

521
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,639
I’ll beg the King to break your
blood contract with Chu Xuan Ji.

522
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,380
You’ll be alright then.

523
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,199
- It’s unnecessary.
- Why?

524
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,520
Can’t bear to lose her?

525
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,640
It tastes so bad!

526
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,800
It’s tasteless! Just like mud!

527
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,559
You’ve tried every flavor in mortal realm

528
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,159
and look down on food in heavens, is it?

529
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,639
Flying Snake, come back.

530
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,199
It’s because of your voracious appetite
that you made the mistake.

531
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,159
That’s how they got the goods on you,
and controlled you!

532
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,919
You’re not even a human.

533
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,782
You don’t need food to survive,

534
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,333
nor should you have feelings for mortals.

535
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,239
I don’t want to listen!

536
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,919
You’re not even on duty today.

537
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,879
Go manage your heavenly troops.

538
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,999
- Why are you here giving me lectures?
- I’ve already made arrangements for them.

539
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,799
My top priority now is to persuade you.

540
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,679
Flying Snake, quickly figure it out,

541
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,839
apologize to King Bailing,
and this will soon be over.

542
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,280
Otherwise, do you really want to share
life and death with your master?

543
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,199
Wake up!

544
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,439
She’s no longer a mortal girl!

545
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,639
Nor is she the God of War!

546
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,520
She’s the biggest enemy of heavens,
Rahu Ketu!

547
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,000
We’ll eradicate him sooner or later.

548
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,199
Are you done?

549
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,680
Get going then. I want to sleep.

550
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,120
Someone crossed the Sea of Life and Death.

551
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,280
Flying Snake, what are you doing?

552
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:57,599
Let me go!

553
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,039
Stay here and calm yourself down.

554
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,919
I’ll handle the matter
at the Sea of Life and Death.

555
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,480
Flying Snake, get back here!

556
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,960
Move, all of you!

557
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:16,360
Lord Flying Snake?

558
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,719
I mean I’m in charge of this little demon.

559
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,535
Get out of here.

560
00:42:22,536 --> 00:42:23,599
Come, fight me.

561
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,160
Fight me!

562
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,975
Is this all you have? How dare you
barge into the heavens?

563
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:39,719
Alright, it’s none of your business now.
I’ll take him to the prison for sanction.

564
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,247
Wait.

565
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:43,999
Lord Flying Snake,
aren’t you being punished

566
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,440
and confined in prison by King Bailing?

567
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,119
How dare you question me?

568
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,200
I do not dare. It’s just...

569
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,999
Did you see this?

570
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,240
Do I have to report to you
every time King Bailing assigns me a task?

571
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,160
Let’s go.

572
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,639
That was so close.
Why did you venture the heavens alone?

573
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,479
It’s not a lasting solution for heavens
and Demon Citadel to go on like this.

574
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,519
Bailing is wary of Rahu Ketu.

575
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,048
Using those dirty tricks will only
deepen the hatred on both sides.

576
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:26,759
Do you think the situation
will get any better

577
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,959
if King Bailing
is willing to see Rahu Ketu?

578
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,632
Si Feng, Rahu Ketu isn’t
that stinky woman Xuan Ji.

579
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:33,840
He is.

580
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,479
They share the same origin and life.

581
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,734
I believe that Rahu Ketu just
wants to seek justice for himself.

582
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:42,519
He doesn’t want all life to be in misery.

583
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,679
I don’t know.

584
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,606
I think if you recklessly see
King Bailing, you’ll only anger him.

585
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,919
It’s too dangerous! He’ll kill you!

586
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,391
If three realms and demon realm are at war

587
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:54,502
then I’ll not be the only one in danger.

588
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:57,800
Even if it’s risky, I need to try it.

589
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,838
Flying Snake! You’re really imprudent!

590
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,440
Don’t try to let the demon go!

591
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,999
Hurry and go!
King Bailing is in Zhongtian Palace.

592
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,959
I’ll stop this Green Dragon.

593
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,120
Thank you.

594
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,279
You’re a mere demon,
how dare you trespass on my palace?

595
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,839
The Evil Suppression Mantra in Zhongtian

596
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,439
won’t allow anyone without
celestial soul to pass through.

597
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,879
Once a demon steps into it, he can’t live
for long before turning into ashes.

598
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,679
You’ve sought your own demise.

599
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,334
King Bailing, you
know why I’m here.

600
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:46,879
Heavens and demon realms
don’t have to fight to the death.

601
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,959
Why must you push the matter
beyond the point of no return?

602
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,999
Do not distort the truth!

603
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,759
It’s Rahu Ketu who wanted to overturn
the three realms with his demons.

604
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,959
He destroyed Fenru City,
broke through Demon Citadel,

605
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,159
smashed the heavenly gate

606
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,519
and forced the heavens to release
the Sea of Life and Death.

607
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,879
It all happened because of him!

608
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,679
How dare you come and claim innocence?

609
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,679
The heavens will surely eradicate him,
and wipe out all the demons.

610
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,920
And I will stop wasting my
breath on a dying demon like you.

611
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,159
Why did you possess celestial soul?

612
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,486
I’ve no idea.

613
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,150
Perhaps you’re mistaken.

614
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,559
Stop playing tricks.

615
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,680
I’ll know your identity right away.

616
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,280
Xi Xuan?

617
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:19,719
You did nothing wrong.

618
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,400
You shouldn’t die here.

619
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,519
Who are you?

620
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,918
I’ll send you to Fenru City
to enter the mortal realm.

621
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,440
The heavens can’t simply hurt you there.

622
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
No!

623
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:46,040
Let her go.

624
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,879
Greetings, Jade Emperor.

625
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,079
God of War.

626
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,159
My son, Xi Xuan, is willing to lose
his 10,000-year-old immortal form

627
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,559
to beg for a chance of survival for you.

628
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,479
Regarding this,
the blame is on the heavens after all.

629
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,022
We’ve wronged you.

630
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:06,439
So today, I’ll let you undergo
ten lifetimes of trials in mortal realm

631
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,839
to wear out your resentment.

632
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,000
As for your fate, it depends on you.

633
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,639
Xi Xuan, my son, as the
Celestial Rose Gold Bird,

634
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,759
it took you 10,000 years
to take human form

635
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,679
but now that you become human,
you’ll lose your immortal forms.

636
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,160
Do you regret it?

637
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,400
I do not.

638
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,840
Never mind. You go to the mortal realm,
and undergo ten lifetimes of trials too.

639
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,480
Bailing, do you regret your actions today?

640
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,000
I did everything for the three realms.

641
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,320
I have nothing to regret!
