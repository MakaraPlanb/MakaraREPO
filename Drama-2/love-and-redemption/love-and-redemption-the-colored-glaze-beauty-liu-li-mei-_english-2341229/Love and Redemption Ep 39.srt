00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,359
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,804
<i>EPISODE 39</i>

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,480
From your perspective, you think that
Hao Feng has unlimited love for you.

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,440
And she even removed
your Loveless Mask for you.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
But in reality,

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,079
she stopped loving you
when she found out that you were a demon.

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,519
The cultivators sensed something strange
when she gave birth to her child.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,079
If the old palace lord
didn’t reach there and kill them in time,

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,999
the secrets of Lize Palace
would’ve been revealed.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,719
For Hao Feng, she witnessed the
deaths of her friends and families

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,339
before she got over the fact that
she gave birth to a demon’s child.

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,372
How could she love you?

13
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,093
She could only hate you.

14
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,261
And she wanted to kill you personally.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,840
Oh, Senior,

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
yet you’re trying to force her
to love you just like the past.

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,920
She couldn’t even commit suicide.

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
She was tortured by you every day.

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,079
Continue.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,056
Continue your story!

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
I knew long ago that
you were up to no good.

22
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,599
Do you think I’ll believe you?

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
I will never believe you.

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,035
Because I only believe in myself.

25
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,309
You forced Hao Feng to remove
your Loveless Mask.

26
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,906
She only has hatred for you.

27
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,316
She will never love you.

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,764
Hao Feng,

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,573
what’s wrong?

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,138
Hao Feng.

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,662
Hao Feng!

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,720
- Don’t come near me!
- Hao Feng!

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Hao Feng!

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,939
Don’t come near me.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,538
Don’t come near me.

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,741
Hao Feng.

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
No matter what you do to me,

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
I will never hurt you.

39
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,684
What’s wrong with you?

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,919
The Loveless Curse backfired on you.

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
And she finally had a chance to escape.

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,479
You couldn’t even
control your demonic nature.

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,439
And He Dan Ping, the wife of Shaoyang’s
sect leader, caught you red-handed.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Do you still remember that?

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
Oh, Senior.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,599
You put Lize Palace in danger
because of your carelessness.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,999
You only struck He Dan Ping several times
before you continued your pursuit.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,759
If I didn’t follow you
and exterminate He Dan Ping,

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,930
Shaoyang Sect would’ve known
about our secrets.

50
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,051
And they would’ve lead the other sects
here to destroy us.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,520
So, you were the murderer
of Xuan Ji’s mother.

52
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,879
Yes.

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,040
I did it.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,481
So what if I did it?

55
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,402
I’m doing this in order
to tie up his loose ends.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,720
The old palace lord was biased.

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,280
He still favored my senior
even after all his misdeeds.

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,000
It’s all because he inherited
the 12 Feathers bloodline.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,367
The old palace lord put in so much effort
to place the Loveless Curse on you.

60
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,439
To prevent the Loveless Curse
from triggering,

61
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,599
he went to obtain the Heartless Pill
for you before his death.

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It’s all because he doesn’t want you
to know the truth

63
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,739
and ruin your future.

64
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,791
No.

65
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,410
This is not true!

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,089
You’re lying!

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
You’re a sly villain.

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,159
Hao Feng removed my mask personally!

69
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,198
She swore that she would be with
me no matter if I’m a human or demon!

70
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,496
That’s the truth!

71
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,559
You!

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,280
You should stop lying!

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,920
Father, what’s wrong?

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,353
Senior, you

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,400
were the cause of

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
Hao Feng’s death.

77
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,599
No!

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
That’s not true!

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400
I’m not lying.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,840
Elder Luo knows about this as well.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,159
You can ask him.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,640
Shut up.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,363
Elder Luo.

84
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,000
Please tell me.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Please tell me that

86
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,759
he’s lying.

87
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,451
My lord, no matter
if it’s true or false,

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,440
it’s all in the past now.

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
There’s no need to ask.

90
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,039
Since Elder Luo doesn’t want
to say anything, that’s fine.

91
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I’ll take out the treasure
that I’ve been keeping for over 20 years.

92
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,360
I’ll show it to you.

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
This is the blood letter that
Hao Feng wrote for her father.

94
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Let me read it for you.

95
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,929
I was trapped by a demon.

96
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,599
Blood gushes out from my throat every day.

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,305
How I wish I could end my life here.

98
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,520
Death is my only savior.

99
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:25,419
I was deceived by a demon
because of my feelings. I was humiliated.

100
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,759
And I’ve tainted
Dianjinggu Sect’s reputation.

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
It’s too late for me to regret.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,887
With my death, I will prove that I
will never be together with demons

103
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,088
for all eternity.

104
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:40,657
By Hao Feng.

105
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,594
Impossible.

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Junior,

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
tell me.

108
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,320
You’re lying to me, am I right?

109
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,543
You’re just trying to anger me.

110
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:15,200
I’ve never heard of any spells
that could alter one’s memories

111
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,694
during my stay in Lize Palace.

112
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,280
Senior, explain this then.

113
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,040
There’s no spell that could change time.

114
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,320
You’re just denying the truth.

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,334
Palace Lord!

116
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,778
Father!

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,599
Stop talking.

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,942
The Loveless Curse is triggering.

119
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:08,163
Please consume the Heartless Pill.

120
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,049
Senior.

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,200
What’s wrong?

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,049
If Hao Feng and you were truly in love,

123
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,880
the Loveless Curse would’ve been gone.

124
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,609
- Why is it triggering now?
- Shut up!

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,842
Yu Si Feng.

126
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,320
You would rather shut me up
than to understand

127
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
whether the relationship
between your parents

128
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
is genuine

129
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
or fake?

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,566
Father.

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,440
We fed your mother with the stalactite.

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,239
She’ll wake up soon.

133
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,560
She’ll tell you

134
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,440
how

135
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,200
we fell in love.

136
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,760
He... He’s lying.

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,614
Senior.

138
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,080
I’m not lying.

139
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
Speaking of the stalactite,

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
I remembered something.

141
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,079
Dianjinggu Sect spent two years
searching for the stalactite.

142
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,072
And they’ve finally found
the 1,000-year-old stalactite.

143
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,839
They want to use it to save Hao Feng.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,746
But someone snuck into
Dianjinggu Sect one night

145
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,399
and stole Hao Feng’s body.

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,679
Even though they found the stalactite,
it was too late.

147
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,360
And the previous sect leader
died because of grief.

148
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
Everything was gone.

149
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,326
Senior,

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,680
I don’t think you knew this, right?

151
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,570
What do you mean?

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,333
What do you mean by it was too late?

153
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,032
If a cultivator dies, you can revive him

154
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,574
if you manage to find
a 1,000-year-old stalactite

155
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,807
and feed it to him within three years.

156
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:12,160
After three years, their primordial spirit
will dissipate completely.

157
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,040
There’s no medicine that
could revive the dead!

158
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,920
Didn’t you say you fed her
the 1,000-year-old stalactite?

159
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,840
Let’s look at your Hao Feng then.

160
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,783
Is she alive?

161
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
Or is she dead?

162
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,413
Open the lid!

163
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,136
Father!

164
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,120
Senior, I’m just teasing you.

165
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,280
You were right.

166
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,216
As the two phoenixes fly
side by side, love comes true.

167
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:04,727
You and Hao Feng had a great relationship.

168
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:06,528
I’m so envious of you.

169
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,675
Senior, look.

170
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,062
She’s not dead yet.

171
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
- Hao Feng.
- She is smiling at you.

172
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,912
Hao Feng.

173
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,237
Mother.

174
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,560
I will never... I will never be
together with a demon like you!

175
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
I will never be together
with a demon like you!

176
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,880
As the two phoenixes fly side by side...

177
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,040
As the two phoenixes fly side by side!

178
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,132
Father!

179
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,996
Father.

180
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,266
Father.

181
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,141
Your mother did

182
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,640
love me before she found out that

183
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,160
I was a demon.

184
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,544
We were

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,800
truly in love before.

186
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
Both father and son suffer the same fate.

187
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,680
Such a pity.

188
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,920
I’ve tried my best

189
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,384
to travel the path that I’ve chosen.

190
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:52,465
Yet, it was the most disgraceful path.

191
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,360
I’ve let you down.

192
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I’ve let your mother down as well.

193
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,601
Hurry.

194
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,039
Take the Heartless Pill.

195
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,359
Only then, you’ll be able
to cut off your feelings.

196
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,400
So that you won’t end up like me

197
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,451
and harm yourself and others
in the process.

198
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,848
I won’t take it.

199
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,319
You should take it to save your life!

200
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,562
Father.

201
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,679
Si Feng.

202
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,480
Promise me that you’ll
lead Lize Palace with your all.

203
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,440
And take good care
of the Rose Gold Bird clan.

204
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,590
I promise you.

205
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,594
Father, please take the pill.

206
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,680
Everyone, kneel down before
the passing of Palace Lord!

207
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,549
Father!

208
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,159
What are you doing?
Why aren’t you kneeling?

209
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,880
Every disciple needs to kneel down
for the lord’s passing.

210
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,199
Kneel now!

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,058
The palace lord was muddle-headed
before his passing.

212
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,072
And many things are left unsaid
after his passing.

213
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:49,239
Of course we won’t kneel
before his passing.

214
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,040
Unless, the new palace lord
can convince us.

215
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,720
Only then, we’ll acknowledge him
as our old palace lord.

216
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,120
Vice Palace Lord is heroic and chivalrous.

217
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,880
I’ll acknowledge him
as our new palace lord.

218
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,000
We will acknowledge him
as our new palace lord!

219
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,679
Vice Palace Lord, Si Feng
has the Gold Feather Medallion.

220
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
He’s the new palace lord.

221
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,920
Are you trying to stage a revolt?

222
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
What do you mean by that?

223
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,639
Now, it is a crucial moment
for the sect’s survival.

224
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,413
I just wanted Lize Palace
to retain its legacy.

225
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,214
How could you say it’s a revolt?

226
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Our palace lord has just passed away.

227
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
You can’t even wait for a second?

228
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,633
Yu Si Feng.

229
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,679
Hand over the Gold Feather Medallion.

230
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,559
It’s not a good thing for you
to possess that.

231
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,966
Let me shoulder your burden.

232
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,197
What do you think?

233
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,850
How many of you

234
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,040
have joined Sky Hall?

235
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,239
All demons come from the same clan.

236
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,959
There’s no difference between
Sky Hall and Lize Palace.

237
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,117
Elder Bai,

238
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,537
what’s the 25th rule of Lize Palace?

239
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,214
Those who had joined Lize Palace
cannot join other sects or groups.

240
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:30,340
If not, they will be
considered as traitors!

241
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:31,701
And they may be slain!

242
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,048
<i>GOLD FEATHER MEDALLION</i>

243
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
The Gold Feather Medallion is here.

244
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,840
For those who had joined Sky Hall,

245
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,094
I’ll spare you all

246
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,030
from your misdeed only for today.

247
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,520
After today, I won’t
spare any of you.

248
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,330
Now,

249
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
come out if you want to

250
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
quit Sky Hall.

251
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
I grew up in Lize Palace.

252
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,719
We’re a family.

253
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,075
We should take care of each other.

254
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,760
We shouldn’t sacrifice our lives
for the goals

255
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,591
of the evil Sky Hall.

256
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,217
You! Come back!

257
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,647
Vice Palace Lord.

258
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,400
You colluded with outsiders

259
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,880
and betrayed us.

260
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,932
You’ve broken our rules.

261
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,040
I’ve promised to protect
the Rose Gold Bird clan.

262
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,920
I won’t give up

263
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,720
until I’ve arrested you.

264
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,040
Fine.

265
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,960
Since you’ve agreed to protect our clan,

266
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,640
I’m sure you don’t want your people
to die because of you, right?

267
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,799
You!

268
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,320
You hold your clan members as hostages!
You’re out of your mind!

269
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,774
Hand over the Gold Feather Medallion.

270
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,495
And appoint me as the new palace lord
to guarantee their safety.

271
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
If not, more of them will die.

272
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,756
Yu Si Feng, if you attack us,
I’ll make sure to kill all of them.

273
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,784
We don’t need to fight.

274
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,840
I’m just taking over for several days.

275
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,734
After the crisis has passed,

276
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,120
I promise to return you
the Gold Feather Medallion.

277
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,958
What do you think?

278
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,575
Or do you think that

279
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,640
the Gold Feather Medallion
is more important than their lives?

280
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,160
Very good!

281
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,405
From today onward,

282
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
I will be the leader of Lize Palace.
All of you must follow my orders.

283
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:21,566
Here’s my first order.

284
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,680
Everyone must join Sky Hall.

285
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,240
Those who disobey my orders
will be exterminated.

286
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,800
I fancy you,

287
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,360
yet you don’t know my intention.

288
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,073
Si Feng.

289
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,315
I finally understood

290
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,640
how you felt in the past.

291
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,249
Senior, Heroine Chu
has drank a lot of wine.

292
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,679
She’s very drunk.

293
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,917
But she’s still not willing
to let go of the wine jar.

294
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,200
She won’t listen to me.
Senior, please check on her.

295
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
But is it too late now?

296
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:50,066
I’m sure you’ve been afraid,
anxious, shaken as well, am I right?

297
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,943
They say

298
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,213
you’re a demon,

299
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,354
and I’m the God of War.

300
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,615
That’s why

301
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,960
I must kill you.

302
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,585
Kill you?

303
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,080
How could I kill you?

304
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
How could I kill you?

305
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,911
This is...

306
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,400
I... I would rather quit
being the God of War.

307
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,655
Si Feng.

308
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,360
I know it’s too late for me
to understand your feelings.

309
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,080
But no matter what,

310
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
you shouldn’t lie to me
in the first place.

311
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,080
You shouldn’t lie to me.

312
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,400
Why did you lie to me?

313
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:40,788
Why?

314
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,324
Xuan Ji.

315
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,839
My father gave my mother
this hairpin as a token of love.

316
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,120
Now, I’ll give it to you.

317
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,720
I want the hairpin you gave me last time.

318
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,000
Can you give it to me again?

319
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,399
You mustn’t regret this.

320
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,628
After you take it,

321
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,337
you’ll

322
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,480
belong to me.

323
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:57,689
Purple Fox.

324
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:06,494
Purple Fox?

325
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Your nose is pretty sensitive.

326
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,159
Are you fully healed?

327
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,919
It’s dangerous for you to come here.

328
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,479
Don’t worry about me.

329
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,479
I met Ting Nu and Liu Yi Huan.

330
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,199
And Ting Nu treated my injuries.

331
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,979
I came here because
I was worried about you.

332
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,971
I’ve heard about Si
Feng’s matter as well.

333
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:28,719
He’s the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

334
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,043
And you fought.

335
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,720
I didn’t expect him to be a demon as well.

336
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,013
But do you mind
that he’s a demon?

337
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,319
Shouldn’t I mind that?

338
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,600
If so...

339
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,040
You see, you treated my injuries.

340
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,679
You even became friends
with Ting Nu and I.

341
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,520
Si Feng isn’t an evil demon.

342
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,345
I think he’s in the dark about

343
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:58,346
the relationship of Lize Palace
and Sky Hall as well.

344
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:00,959
So,

345
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,160
- you can’t...
- This is a different story!

346
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,320
He shouldn’t lie to me.

347
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,839
He’s the person I trust the most.

348
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,693
But he hid his true identity from me.

349
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:11,995
This...

350
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:14,316
What about the words he said in the past?

351
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,720
I don’t know which of them
are true or false.

352
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,640
- I...
- You’ll know the truth

353
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,632
when you bring him here
and ask him, am I right?

354
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,999
If he’s lying to you,
you can just chop him up.

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,813
But if there’s a misunderstanding,

356
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:32,383
you two should talk it out
and solve the misunderstanding.

357
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:34,864
You two should find a solution together.

358
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,120
Misunderstanding is the worst thing
that could happen between a couple.

359
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,094
If you miss out on him this time,
maybe you’ll miss out forever.

360
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,407
You’ll regret it.

361
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,967
Fine. I understand now.

362
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:01,625
Seems like Xuan Ji has made up her mind.

363
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,506
Since you’ve made up your mind,

364
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,324
I’ll find Si Feng and tell him that
you don’t want to see him again.

365
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:12,046
I’ll ask him to give up.

366
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:14,300
And you two should sever your ties.

367
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,363
No! I didn’t mean that! I want to see him!

368
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:18,639
It’s just that...

369
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,334
You don’t know how to face him?

370
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,633
Ling Long, you’re mine now.

371
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:48,190
Why are you siding with a traitor?

372
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:50,260
Who’s yours? Shameless man!

373
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,501
Did you forget how we fondled together?

374
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,720
I couldn’t sleep well
without you, you know?

375
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:59,441
So, it’s her, the young lady
of Shaoyang Sect.

376
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:01,990
She had an interesting relationship
with Wu Tong.

377
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:04,280
It’s no wonder she could still be saved
even after joining Sky hall.

378
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:06,760
I think she’s just trying to save herself.

379
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,840
Ling Long, it’s me.

380
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,759
How did you know I’m here?

381
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,119
When we were still in Shaoyang Sect,

382
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,960
you would hide beside the lake
whenever you’re sad.

383
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,772
I know all about them.

384
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,013
Just leave me
alone for now, okay?

385
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,045
You were unhappy ever since
you regained consciousness.

386
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,030
Do you have something on your mind?

387
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,862
Can you tell me about it?

388
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,880
Fine.

389
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,605
I’ll stay here.

390
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,328
You can tell me when you feel like it.

391
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:47,504
I’m always here for you.

392
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,475
Purple Fox,

393
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,263
tell me.

394
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,520
Why must it be Lize Palace?

395
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
Why must he be a Rose Gold Bird?

396
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,040
Why is he defending that evil demon?

397
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,120
That demon killed my mother.

398
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,720
What should I do?

399
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,198
What should I do?

400
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,159
Xuan Ji.

401
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,385
Think about Si Feng.

402
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:44,946
There’s nothing he could’ve done.

403
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,675
He was just a child
when your mother was killed.

404
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,396
He couldn’t decide

405
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,639
what his master wanted to do.

406
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,319
To him, his master is his benefactor.

407
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,120
And Liu Yi Huan told me that

408
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:02,894
his master is his father as well.

409
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,200
He only knew about that recently.

410
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,739
Tell me, what should Si Feng do then?

411
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,742
It’s hard for him to decide.

412
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:13,064
This can’t be.

413
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,198
Xuan Ji, I know.

414
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:23,528
It’s tough for you to endure the
shock and sadness from the truth.

415
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,399
I’m sure Si Feng is suffering as well.

416
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,711
I’ve lived for 1,000 years.

417
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,951
I do understand life to a certain extent.

418
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,360
A lifetime may seem like a long time,

419
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,239
but actually, we only have enough time
to pursue one belief in a lifetime.

420
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,838
So, it’ll depend on you
whether to pursue righteousness

421
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,520
or your heart.

422
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,158
But it’s useless if I pursue
my heart on my own.

423
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,528
You’re right.

424
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,249
That’s why you need to know
what Si Feng is thinking as well.

425
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,960
I’ll ask Liu Yi Huan to find Si Feng.

426
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:06,433
You two must meet up

427
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,345
and explain everything clearly.

428
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,360
But I’m returning to
Shaoyang Sect tomorrow.

429
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,610
Don’t worry. I’ll find you somehow.

430
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:19,998
Wait for my good news.

431
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,720
It’s all my fault.

432
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,695
What did you say?

433
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,254
It’s my fault that

434
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,000
Wu Tong captured me, right?

435
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,294
How is that your fault?

436
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,504
But all of them are saying that.

437
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,440
I didn’t wish for Wu Tong
to capture me at all.

438
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,560
But all of them are despising me
after they heard

439
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,359
what Wu Tong said.

440
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,639
Ling Long, you don’t need to
care about them.

441
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,693
Just pretend that you heard nothing.

442
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,294
But I did hear them.

443
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,720
Why should I pretend not to hear it?

444
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
It has happened,

445
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,440
why must I deny the truth
and lie to myself?

446
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,520
Will you join them?

447
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,039
Will you laugh at me?

448
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,557
When I was young,
the children in my village

449
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,270
always teased me for being an orphan.

450
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,253
I could only pretend not to hear it.

451
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,452
Because if I care
about their insults,

452
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,777
they would insult me even more.

453
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
We can’t seal people’s mouths.

454
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,431
But we can choose not to listen.

455
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,042
Ling Long.

456
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,745
You did nothing wrong.

457
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:06,949
At least you’re not guilty of it.

458
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,908
Don’t worry.

459
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
I will always accompany you.

460
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,360
It will be over eventually.

461
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,300
Okay?

462
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,251
Return to me right now!

463
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,550
You’ll always be mine!

464
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,347
You will never escape me!

465
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,280
No!

466
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,696
Many years ago, a
disciple of Lize Palace

467
00:39:19,697 --> 00:39:22,439
fell in love with the daughter
of Dianjinggu Sect’s old leader.

468
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,000
They could had lived happily together.

469
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:27,559
They even had a child.

470
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,719
But the cultivators took away
the sect leader’s daughter by force.

471
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,949
In the end,

472
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,920
she committed suicide.

473
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:50,919
<i>WEN HAO FENG FROM DIANJINGGU SECT</i>

474
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,122
Hao Feng,

475
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,295
she’s your mother.

476
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
Hao Feng is my wife.

477
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,920
She’s your mother as well.

478
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,200
I’m your master,

479
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,720
but I’m your father as well.

480
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,760
She was always here.

481
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,568
But why?

482
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:13,694
Why didn’t you tell me?

483
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,640
I’m just waiting for

484
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
your mother to wake up.

485
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,880
I wanted to tell you everything
after she wakes up.

486
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,520
She’s the best woman in the world.

487
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,339
Marriage is forbidden
for disciples of Lize Palace.

488
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,622
The old palace lord used your mother
to threaten me.

489
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:35,983
He forced me to swear a blood oath.

490
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,791
That I’ll only be able to acknowledge you
when you become an adult.

491
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,855
But in this world,

492
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,307
no father can stand the fact that
they couldn’t acknowledge their son.

493
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,680
Can you call me

494
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,920
father?

495
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,481
No one in the world must
separate Hao Feng and I.

496
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,600
People who had forced her

497
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,562
and harmed her, weren’t
they supposed to die?

498
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,051
So what if he’s a demon?

499
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:08,079
It won’t work out when he’s a demon?

500
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,846
Didn’t you say that
you would love him forever?

501
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,121
She’s deceiving you!

502
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:17,120
If you two really loved each other,
feuds will never form between you two!

503
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,720
Si Feng, you knew this all along?

504
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,310
And you hid this from me all the time?

505
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,728
I didn’t hide anything from you!

506
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:28,729
Si Feng, you were lying to me all along!

507
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,084
No matter how true your vows
are, once they discover your identity,

508
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:38,345
it will end badly.

509
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,133
If you get together with her,

510
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:44,254
you will be the one
who suffers in the end.

511
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,500
Palace Lord,

512
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:19,473
Master didn’t want to listen to me.

513
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,060
I can only beg you now.

514
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:27,259
Now that you’re in heaven,
I hope you can bless Master

515
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,839
so that he can learn something
from your past mistakes.

516
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,968
I hope he’ll take the Heartless Pill
and forget about Chu Xuan Ji.

517
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,201
And I hope that
the demon clan will thrive.

518
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:37,798
So that we can kill all those humans.

519
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:40,839
Dianjinggu Sect, Fuyu Island,
Shaoyang Sect,

520
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,197
I hope every one of them dies!

521
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,491
Silver Snake.

522
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,400
What nonsense are you saying?

523
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,976
Get out.

524
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,377
Fine.

525
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:05,191
- Palace Lord.
- Palace Lord.

526
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,655
The Gold Feather Medallion
is in your hands now.

527
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,439
Why did you come here?

528
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,519
You don’t need to be so hostile.

529
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,226
We come from the same clan.

530
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,320
I wish for our clan to thrive as well.

531
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,138
Actually, we can work together.

532
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,720
You killed your own clan members.

533
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,594
You still dare to propose a collaboration?

534
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,875
The people whom I killed were useless.

535
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,638
But you’re different.

536
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,319
Once you break the shackles
of the 12 Feathers bloodline,

537
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,320
you’ll be able to become
one of the most powerful demon.

538
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,749
You want to borrow my power?

539
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,480
You need to show me your sincerity.

540
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,840
Why don’t you tell me
what exactly are you up to?

541
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:14,448
The things that I want to do
are beneficial to demons naturally.

542
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,851
Do you know the identity of the
Rose Gold Bird clan 1,000 years ago?

543
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,879
We were the personal guards of King Asura.

544
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,925
We were the first platoon to attack
the heavens!

545
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,006
Our clan was glorious then.

546
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,319
Unlike now!

547
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,948
We can only hide in mortal realm,
cover our face with masks

548
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,629
in order to hide our demon powers.

549
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,716
We’ll revive the Star of Mosha
and dominate the three realms!

550
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:49,673
By then, we’ll be able to do
whatever we want in the three realms.

551
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:52,274
And everyone will bow to us.

552
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,239
The Star of Mosha was dead long ago.

553
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,200
Stop daydreaming.

554
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,719
You are so close with Shaoyang Sect.

555
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,120
Don’t tell me you don’t know this?

556
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,678
The Jade Cup, in their secret ground,
contains the core of Star of Mosha.

557
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,616
As long as we save Wu Zhi Qi

558
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,679
and use the Yuntian Loop and
Chehai Hook to unseal the Jade Cup,

559
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,794
we’ll be able to revive the Star of Mosha.

560
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,363
And we can pay them back

561
00:45:27,943 --> 00:45:29,703
for our humiliations.

562
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,573
Since that’s the case,

563
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,880
I still don’t understand something.

564
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,619
What has this got to do with Xuan Ji?

565
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,540
Why are you making things
difficult for her?

566
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,040
I’ve told you enough.

567
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,789
Why don’t you show me
your sincerity as well?

568
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:50,058
I’ll tell you my goal after that.

569
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,327
So, what exactly do you want me to do?
