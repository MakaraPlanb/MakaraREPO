00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,476
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,872
<i>EPISODE 33</i>

3
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,559
You won’t do this without reason.
I’m sure you have a favor to ask.

4
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,879
Tell me.

5
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,359
What’s the relationship between
King Bailing and God of War?

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,919
Are the tribulations of the God of War

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,439
somehow connected to her relationship
with King Bailing?

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,019
Honestly, I don’t believe it too.

9
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,411
But everyone in the heavens
believes so.

10
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,962
I have no choice
but to believe it as well.

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,519
Her love turned into hatred?

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,749
I don’t think

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,790
she’s a person like that.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,598
Don’t worry.

15
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,895
King Bailing is only concerned about
the three realms.

16
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,166
He won’t snatch away your woman.

17
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,839
This is too hard. How do I solve this?

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,550
I can’t solve it!

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,902
The hair didn’t change at all.

20
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,758
Did I overthink?

21
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,189
Yu Si Feng wasn’t a demon after all.

22
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,678
Maybe the demon in Qingmu Town

23
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,229
is connected to the demon in Mount Buzhou.

24
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,070
That demon has malignant aura
surrounding it.

25
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,357
It’s not an ordinary demon.

26
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,582
Thank you, Sect Leader.

27
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,242
You wouldn’t have been
hurt if it weren’t for Xuan Ji.

28
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,473
I should thank you instead.

29
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,506
You’re too good

30
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,630
for Xuan Ji.

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,084
By the way, Sect Leader,

32
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:50,999
I just remembered that something
fell out of the demon’s body

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,439
when I fought him on Mount Buzhou.

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,622
The demon wanted to
harm Xuan Ji and the rest.

35
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,333
But I don’t know
what exactly was he up to.

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,982
That’s why I want to revisit
the altar on Mount Buzhou.

37
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,811
Maybe I can find some clues.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,039
You’re injured now.

39
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,759
You shouldn’t overexert yourself.

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,989
I think

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,540
we should send our spirit beast,
Hong Luan, to check it out.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,021
You should go on a
retreat and recuperate.

43
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,292
That’s a good idea.

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,271
Sect Leader, sorry for the trouble.

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,266
Master!

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,496
- Master!
- What’s wrong?

47
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,039
Why are you so anxious?

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,399
Some demons from Sky Hall
are gathering at the base of our mountain!

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,799
And, Sixth Junior is there as well.

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,310
What?

51
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,919
Don’t worry.

52
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,310
Everyone will appreciate
what you did in the future.

53
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,487
I don’t know why,

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,621
but I feel uneasy.

55
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,990
I don’t know what Wu Tong
put inside this box.

56
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,762
We should be careful.

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,552
Master.

58
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,328
You scum!

59
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,839
How dare you come back!

60
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,519
- Master, Aunt...
- Shut up!

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,077
You traitor! You betrayed us
and joined Sky Hall!

62
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:50,959
I don’t have a disciple like you!

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,219
Min Yan, how could you join the demons?

64
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,039
You better kowtow and apologize
to your master right now!

65
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,710
Master, Aunt Ying Hong,

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,839
I’m not here to beg for
Master’s forgiveness.

67
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,790
I’m here to represent Sky Hall today.

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,319
What did you say?

69
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,919
Say that again?

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,870
Master, please calm down.

71
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
Don’t think that you don’t
need to worry about us

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,919
because you got back
Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

73
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,839
Actually, you only got half of it back.

74
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,479
Half of it?

75
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,870
What do you mean? Explain yourself!

76
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,653
Ling Long is still unconscious, right?

77
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:32,679
You should think of the reason why

78
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,319
and cooperate with our superintendent.

79
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,919
Only by doing so,
you’ll be able to save Ling Long.

80
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,879
Sixth Junior, what do you mean by that?

81
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,430
- What do you mean by that?
- Explain yourself!

82
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,519
Everyone has their own ambitions.

83
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,152
Everyone, you all don’t need to be angry.

84
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,472
How dare you say that?

85
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,478
You came to my sect
when you were eight years old.

86
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,808
And I’ve raised you until
you became an adult.

87
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,119
But only now, I finally understand
what your ambition was.

88
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,211
Fine. Hero Zhong,
why are you here?

89
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:05,799
Do you want to threaten me
with Ling Long’s primordial spirit again?

90
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,990
Hero Zhong, you better accomplish
the mission our superintendent gave you!

91
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,529
Master.

92
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,759
Our superintendent commanded me
to send you a gift.

93
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,150
As the leader of the Five Great Sects,

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,830
we hope that you won’t create trouble
for us anymore.

95
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,990
And we’ll reward you for your cooperation.

96
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,390
How could demons such as you
order Shaoyang Sect around?

97
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,438
Min Jue?

98
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,959
- Second Senior!
- Senior!

99
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,070
- Min Jue!
- Senior!

100
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,248
You beast!

101
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,504
How dare you harm your fellow senior!

102
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:04,695
Master!

103
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,350
Min Yan, are you okay?

104
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,279
Impossible!

105
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,670
Master, I didn’t kill Second Senior!

106
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,079
You know I won’t do this!

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,933
I don’t know why he’s dead!

108
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,999
I thought he was still in the cell!
How could this happen?

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,399
Master, you must believe in me!

110
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,590
I didn’t expect myself

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,845
to raise an ingrate like you.

112
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,579
Today, I’ll slay you
for justice’s sake!

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,910
We have no time for explanations!
Let’s go!

114
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,802
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

115
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,713
I didn’t expect them to possess
the Teleportation Charm.

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,510
- Min Yan.
- Second Senior!

117
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,983
Min Yan.

118
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,294
Why didn’t you let

119
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,919
my master kill me?

120
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,472
Both of us know that Min Jue’s death
has nothing to do with you.

121
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,783
It’s Wu Tong!

122
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,390
He killed Second Senior!

123
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:27,896
He did it on purpose!

124
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,350
- And I actually became his accomplice!
- Min Yan!

125
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,119
- Min Yan!
- He died because of me!

126
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,768
Second Senior was dead because of me!

127
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,444
I deserve to die!

128
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,707
Zhong Min Yan!

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,990
You can kill yourself if you want to.

130
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,039
But what about Ling Long?

131
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,359
Who will save her?

132
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,790
Who will retrieve her primordial spirit?

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,190
We still have many things
we need to accomplish.

134
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,578
You need to pull yourself together.

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,470
We still have many tasks to complete.

136
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,230
If not, your Second Senior
will die in vain.

137
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,709
You mustn’t spoil our plan
because of your impatience.

138
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,757
Wu Tong,

139
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,070
I will seek my revenge.

140
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,029
You will pay for this!

141
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,719
You two have finally returned.

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,119
What will you cook today?

143
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,829
Hurry, I’m starving to death.

144
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,866
Food is the only thing
that’s on your mind.

145
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,162
It’s a secret.

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,479
You two have finally returned.
Something huge has happened.

147
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,390
We received a notice from Shaoyang Sect.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,390
How could this happen?

149
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,670
Second Senior is dead?
And Sixth Senior is the murderer?

150
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,830
Sixth Senior has been kicked out
of Shaoyang Sect.

151
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,230
Impossible. I don’t believe it.

152
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,007
Sixth Senior is a kind person.

153
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,918
He won’t resort to such despicable acts!

154
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,145
I’m sure there’s something behind this.

155
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:04,496
The spirit beast of Sect Leader Chu
sent us a letter.

156
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,078
Father said that

157
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,439
Sixth Senior has joined Sky Hall.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,117
He wants us to be careful.

159
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,748
And he wants us to return
to the sect earlier.

160
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,703
He even said that...

161
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,134
He said we only brought

162
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:30,359
half of Ling Long’s primordial spirit
back from Mount Buzhou.

163
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,310
And Ling Long is still unconscious.

164
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,013
We were

165
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,405
cheated by Wu Tong.

166
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,521
This Wu Tong...

167
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,570
In order to exchange for
Ling Long’s primordial spirit,

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,199
five of us went into Mount Buzhou,
yet only two of us came back.

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,545
Sixth Senior even joined Sky Hall
because of this.

170
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,840
But in the end, we still couldn’t
retrieve Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

171
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,649
Although we didn’t
completely save Ling Long,

172
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,670
she would’ve been dead without
the primordial spirit you brought back.

173
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,729
Ting Nu, please make some
Birth Candles for me.

174
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,256
I want to enter Mount Buzhou once again.

175
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,519
I want to save both Ling Long
and Sixth Senior.

176
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,879
It’s not that easy to make Birth Candles.

177
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,250
We need rare ingredients to make them.

178
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,161
I’m afraid Dragon Scales
are too hard to find.

179
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,559
What should we do then?

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,919
I...

181
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,639
Flying Snake.

182
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,159
Flying Snake, come here.

183
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,748
Aren’t you a heavenly officer?

184
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,779
You can help me enter Mount Buzhou, right?

185
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,290
Please take me there, okay?

186
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,839
I can enter that place with no difficulty.

187
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,913
- Bring us there then.
- Sure.

188
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,470
Wait, we have a problem.

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,029
Now, I’m your spirit beast.

190
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,639
And you’re a useless mortal.

191
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,439
Because of that, my powers are restricted
and I can’t enter Mount Buzhou.

192
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,587
You!

193
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,994
How about you chop off your arm?

194
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:54,054
I’ll be free by then and I can
help you enter Mount Buzhou.

195
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,466
Fine.

196
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,226
You can chop off my arm

197
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,337
if it means that I can save
Ling Long and Sixth Senior.

198
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,129
Wait, I have an idea.

199
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,279
The pieces of primordial spirit
can sense each other.

200
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,643
Flying Snake, you should be able

201
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,794
to bring back the rest by using primordial
spirit residing in Ling Long’s body.

202
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,239
You know quite a lot.

203
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,919
But only I, the great heavenly officer,

204
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,110
am capable of powerful feats as such.

205
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,920
This is great. Let’s return to
Shaoyang Sect immediately.

206
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,220
Okay. Let’s go.

207
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,432
What’s for dinner tonight?

208
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,917
Here.

209
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,019
Fill my cup.

210
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,071
My Lord.

211
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,990
We’ve sent your gift

212
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,490
to Shaoyang Sect.

213
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,791
What?

214
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,770
It’s such a big gift.

215
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,921
Didn’t your master
ask you to stay for dinner?

216
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,190
Oh, I almost forgot.

217
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,359
You’ve been kicked out of Shaoyang Sect.

218
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,750
Now, everyone knows that
you belong to Sky Hall now.

219
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,510
You will never be able to
return to Shaoyang Sect.

220
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,593
Reward him with some wine!

221
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,959
After you drink this,

222
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,159
you should just work for me
with all your heart.

223
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,910
Naturally, I won’t treat you badly.

224
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,346
Min Yan!

225
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,722
Wu Tong!

226
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,918
What?

227
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,309
You can’t continue your act anymore?

228
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,999
You’re far worse at acting than me.

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,236
In the past, when I worked for our leader,

230
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,109
I always followed his every
order and acted obediently.

231
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,479
I would never let him notice
that it was all an act.

232
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,816
But you?

233
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,039
Why?

234
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,192
What do you mean?

235
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,823
Why did you kill Second Senior?

236
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,321
He’s no threat.

237
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:20,032
And he has never offended you!

238
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,990
I didn’t kill your Second Senior.

239
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,668
Don’t stare at me like that.

240
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,699
My beloved Ling Long

241
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:34,051
was the one behind
your Second Senior’s death.

242
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,191
Me?

243
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,239
Did you forget?

244
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,020
You gave Chen Min Jue
the poisonous glutinous rice cake

245
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:44,571
yourself last night.

246
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,679
Why are you staring at
Ling Long like that?

247
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,199
Are you perplexed?

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,405
Are you raging inside?

249
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,998
Or are you wondering why your
beloved Ling Long became like this?

250
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
You don’t even understand her well.

251
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,493
You don’t even know
what’s her favorite food.

252
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,644
Come, let me help you out.

253
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,496
Someone!

254
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,950
Give Min Yan your
favorite glutinous rice cake.

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,953
Go.

256
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,537
Brother Wu Tong,
why don’t we just forget it?

257
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,013
I’ll treat glutinous rice cake
as my favorite food, okay?

258
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:44,766
Are you trying to disobey me?

259
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,279
North Superintendent, although Min Yan
committed mistakes,

260
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,576
he doesn’t deserve to die.

261
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,287
North Superintendent,
please give him another chance.

262
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,176
Brother Wu Tong.

263
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,675
Zhong Min Yan, you’re
getting more stupid.

264
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,676
Do you think I would poison you?

265
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,263
I don’t want my audience
to die on me, you know?

266
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:24,804
But you better listen up.

267
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,959
I hate it when people touch my stuff.

268
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,459
You better don’t come up with tricks
under my watch.

269
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,367
Ling Long is mine.

270
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:38,679
If you do something you shouldn’t,
I’ll send Shaoyang Sect more gifts.

271
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,030
By then, it’ll be more
than just Chen Min Jue.

272
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,270
Come, let’s go.

273
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,184
Stinky woman, I’m the best
heavenly officer there is.

274
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:01,918
How dare you make me
do such cowardly things?

275
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,642
We still need to save Sixth Senior
after we retrieve Ling Long’s spirit.

276
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,188
If my father knows about this,
he won’t let us leave Shaoyang Sect.

277
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,671
We can only use this path. Hurry!

278
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,793
Zhong Min Yan, accompany
me to the gate of Fenru City.

279
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,184
I’ll visit Shen Shu and Yu Lu.

280
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,303
I’m talking to you.
Why aren’t you responding?

281
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,970
I know.

282
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,679
You’re angry at me because
of your senior’s death.

283
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,724
But you can’t blame me for this.

284
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,119
I didn’t know that
glutinous rice cake was poisonous.

285
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,894
Just forget it. It’s only one death.

286
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,730
There are so many disciples
in Shaoyang Sect.

287
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,721
I’ll capture another guy
and let him accompany you, okay?

288
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,151
Scram.

289
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,394
Zhong Min Yan.

290
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,759
You better know what’s good for you.

291
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,964
No one has ever spoken
to me, Ling Long, in that tone.

292
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,755
Don’t call yourself
Ling Long in front of me!

293
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,070
You’re not Ling Long!

294
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,590
You don’t even deserve
to mention her name!

295
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,845
Stop!

296
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,329
Explain yourself then!

297
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,858
What do you mean by I’m not Ling Long?

298
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,405
All of you told me the same thing!

299
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,456
Although I don’t understand your words,
I’m not stupid!

300
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,490
That person you spoke of,
how is she connected with me?

301
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,320
So what if we look exactly the same?
Why am I inferior compared to her?

302
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,699
Fine.

303
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,970
Since you want me to speak,

304
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,929
I’ll tell you everything.

305
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,570
There’s only one Ling Long in this world.

306
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,519
And that Ling Long is in Shaoyang Sect.

307
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,719
It’s more than a coincidence that
you look exactly the same as her.

308
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,808
Wu Tong made you because
he couldn’t obtain her.

309
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,721
Wu Tong stole
Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

310
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:48,578
He extracted
half of your primordial spirit

311
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,559
and insert half of Ling Long’s
primordial spirit into your body.

312
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,559
He made you his puppet.

313
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,319
And you will only adapt an appearance

314
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,462
and a personality that suit his liking!

315
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:03,164
You’re wearing red because
that’s Ling Long’s favorite color.

316
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,199
Wu Tong is treating you well

317
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,310
only because he wanted the real Ling Long.

318
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,759
You’re not a flower demon,
and you’re not Ling Long either.

319
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,790
You’re just a monster
that resembles no one!

320
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,950
One’s heart is the hardest to imitate.

321
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,990
You only have Ling Long’s appearance

322
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,241
and her demeanor.

323
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,463
But you’re not her!

324
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,971
No matter how willful
the real Ling Long is,

325
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,306
she always has a kind heart.

326
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,910
A person like you, who aids
the evil, will never become her!

327
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,838
Impossible.

328
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,159
Everything you said was a lie.

329
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,453
They’re not real! I’m the real Ling Long!

330
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,924
You’re lying to me!

331
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,140
Am I lying to you?

332
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:53,251
If so, why did you cry when I was hurt?

333
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,106
Why did you space out
when you saw my dagger?

334
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,670
Why do you feel familiar with
every word you said to me?

335
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,821
Am I lying to you?

336
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,212
Or is it because the Ling Long
inside of you is trying to remember me?

337
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,377
Tell me!

338
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,279
Fine!

339
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,319
All of you are up to no good!

340
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,110
I’ll ask Brother Wu Tong
to kill you right away!

341
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,799
Fine.

342
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,019
Go now.

343
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,390
Ask him to kill me right now.

344
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,439
This is better.

345
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,759
You don’t need to find out the truth.

346
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,599
Just do your part and be his puppet.

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,230
And lost your own identity in the process.

348
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,887
Scram!

349
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,919
Here.

350
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,390
This is the place
where I first grew up and cultivated.

351
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,470
I saved you because you were
destined to be mine.

352
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:13,399
I have a name for you as well.
You will be Ling Long.

353
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,350
What are you doing? Let me go!

354
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,004
- It’s not there.
- She’s not Ling Long.

355
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,856
How is it?

356
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,079
The clone looked exactly like her,
doesn’t it?

357
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,959
Even you don’t know
who’s the real Ling Long, right?

358
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,444
You’re wearing red because
red is Ling Long’s favorite color.

359
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:37,430
Wu Tong treats you well because
he wants the real Ling Long!

360
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,781
I remember now.

361
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,470
Yellow is my favorite color.

362
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,030
Yellow is my original color.

363
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,110
Everything here

364
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,950
was familiar to me.

365
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,802
But now,

366
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,550
it feels like I’m in unfamiliar territory.

367
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,070
Don’t tell me it’s because

368
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,790
I’m not the original me anymore?

369
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,830
What if Brother Tong doesn’t like this?

370
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,831
I’ll just change it back.

371
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,990
Brother Wu Tong.

372
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,799
Brother Wu Tong.

373
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,110
What’s on your mind?

374
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,159
Our leader asked me
to prepare some troops for him.

375
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,119
Sky Hall will hold a major operation soon.

376
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,590
I was wondering if I should help him.

377
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,630
What’s wrong? Do you need anything?

378
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:03,776
Look.

379
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,070
When did you change your clothes?

380
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,910
Do you like it?

381
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,110
If you don’t like it,
I can change it back.

382
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,076
As long as you like it.

383
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,009
Really? So, are you saying that
I can wear anything that I like?

384
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,144
Brother Wu Tong, are you saying that
I can choose my own appearance?

385
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:30,528
As long as you’re happy.

386
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:31,878
- I...
- Ling Long.

387
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,748
I’m busy now.

388
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:36,939
Go out and play.

389
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,445
Second Senior, I
still owe you a drink.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,422
We were going to finish this wine
and listen to your story together.

391
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,110
But I didn’t expect you
to leave us just like that.

392
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,026
Min Yan, you traitor.

393
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:00,337
I will definitely capture you.

394
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,814
And make you confess in front
of Second Senior.

395
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,199
But I still don’t believe that
Min Yan is behind this.

396
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,039
First Senior, you’re still
defending him even now?

397
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,430
You saw Second Senior’s body
when they sent him back, right?

398
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,383
If Min Yan joined Sky Hall
because he didn’t have a choice,

399
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:22,143
he should’ve returned to us when
Sky Hall asked him to come here!

400
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,093
I think this is a huge blow to Master.

401
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,804
We should go and visit him.

402
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,630
Sorry, Second Senior. It’s all my fault.

403
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,870
I didn’t manage to save you.

404
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,190
They should’ve taken me
instead of you while we were there.

405
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,364
Xuan Ji, I know it’s boring
to stay here and recuperate.

406
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:53,557
That’s why I brought you something.

407
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,639
Second Junior, you’re willing to
give Xuan Ji your favorite treasure?

408
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,446
My junior is so chivalrous.

409
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:03,557
I should reward her for that.

410
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,850
Don’t worry.

411
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:08,601
I will find out the truth and avenge you.

412
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,759
Ling Long!

413
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,450
Ling Long, we’ve found a way to save you.

414
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,973
When you get better, we’ll
find Sixth Senior together.

415
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,284
Please wait a little longer.

416
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,630
Flying Snake, come and
examine Ling Long’s condition.

417
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,596
I’ll make you some Snowflake Beef.

418
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,879
I just need to resummon the other half
of her primordial spirit, right?

419
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,430
No problem. Just watch.

420
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,631
What’s going on?

421
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,071
Again.

422
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,470
You!

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,359
Someone kept boasting that
he’s a heavenly officer.

424
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,590
I think your powers are weaker
than your boasting skill.

425
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,317
- Stupid rat snake, shut up!
- You’re a snake as well!

426
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,912
Wait, logically, her primordial
spirit will return to her

427
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,270
if I try to summon it,
no matter how far away it is.

428
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,750
Unless...

429
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,679
Unless what?

430
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,550
Unless her primordial spirit
is trapped within another body.

431
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,319
It’ll be troublesome if that’s the case.

432
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,351
Let me see what’s going on
by examining her primordial spirit.

433
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,259
Brother Wu Tong told me that
I’m not a puppet.

434
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,392
Brother Wu Tong likes me for who I am.

435
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,903
He said I can do whatever I want to.

436
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,750
I’m too lazy to bother with you.

437
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,839
It’s Sixth Senior.

438
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,319
What’s wrong?

439
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,652
Sixth Senior.

440
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,003
I heard his voice!

441
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,241
Sixth Senior,

442
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,999
- I’m Xuan Ji.
- What did you call me?

443
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,559
I can hear you.

444
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,230
Sixth Senior, I’m Xuan Ji.

445
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,558
Xuan Ji? What’s going on?

446
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,841
We tried to resummon
Ling Long’s primordial spirit,

447
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:29,382
but we heard your voice instead.

448
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:31,261
Where’s the other half
of her primordial spirit?

449
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,270
It’s inside the flower demon
who looked exactly like her.

450
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,399
It’s no wonder Wu Tong
treasures her so much.

451
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,399
Sixth Senior, did you stay in Sky Hall

452
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,879
in order to find the other half
of her primordial spirit?

453
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,191
I don’t believe that
you’re joining them on your own accord.

454
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:45,342
And I don’t believe that
you’ve killed Second Senior.

455
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,463
Since it has come to this,

456
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:51,137
Xuan Ji, you’re the only person
who still believes in me.

457
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,359
I will find a way and retrieve the
remaining half of her primordial spirit.

458
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,750
And, I’ll apologize to Master.

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,070
Dumb mortal, do you think
you can retrieve it without any problem?

460
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,230
You need the Soul Bell, you know?

461
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,518
Soul Bell?

462
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,690
Since Wu Tong can steal
Ling Long’s primordial spirit,

463
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:16,279
it means that he has the Soul Bell.

464
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,946
Min Yan, try to steal
the Soul Bell from him.

465
00:29:19,947 --> 00:29:21,337
We’ll meet up in Mount Buzhou.

466
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,559
So what if you manage to steal it?
You need to know how to use it.

467
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,601
Flying Snake,
stop beating around the bush.

468
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,272
Just tell us if you have the solution.

469
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,602
I’ll make you sweet and sour fish as well.

470
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,124
Kid, turn around.

471
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,839
- What is this?
- The Sun Moon Charm.

472
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,159
After I draw that, I can detect
you within a proximity of 2.5 km.

473
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,839
We can’t just bring her
wherever we go, right?

474
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,639
As long as you’re able to
steal the Soul Bell,

475
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,470
I can retrieve the other half of her
primordial soul outside of Mount Buzhou.

476
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,230
We should act in haste.
Let’s go to Mount Buzhou now.

477
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,262
Sixth Senior, please be careful.

478
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,500
Okay.

479
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,150
What happened just now?

480
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,679
Nothing.

481
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,510
Wait, I felt like
I was trying to say something.

482
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,910
Oh right, didn’t you let me use a mirror

483
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,721
that could show me my past lives?

484
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:36,272
Can you show it to me again?

485
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,910
Only half of it went inside?

486
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:00,687
It’s hard indeed using another body.

487
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,079
So, this wasn’t my true look after all.

488
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,554
You saw everything?
You know what’s going on now?

489
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,899
Brother Wu Tong replaced half of
my primordial spirit with Ling Long’s.

490
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,959
And my primordial spirit was left
at the place I trained at.

491
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,839
Where’s the place?

492
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,145
It’s at...

493
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,571
Give it to me!

494
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:37,573
It’s no use even if you take it back.

495
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,559
But we can help you.

496
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,533
Help me? Do you think I don’t know
what you are plotting?

497
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,759
You just wanted
Ling Long’s primordial spirit, right?

498
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,639
- I won’t fall for it.
- Yes.

499
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,486
We’re trying to
retrieve her primordial spirit.

500
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,399
But don’t you want to be yourself?

501
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,590
It’s a win-win situation. So, why not?

502
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,210
Are you afraid that
Wu Tong won’t like you

503
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,719
if you return to your past self?

504
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,216
It’s not that!

505
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,901
Brother Wu Tong likes me.
Not that Ling Long.

506
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:04,639
Fine, I’ll do it then.

507
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,799
I’ll prove to you that
Brother Wu Tong likes me.

508
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,999
And I’m not a replacement of
that Ling Long.

509
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,019
Fine. But now,

510
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,254
we lack something that could
extract one’s primordial spirit.

511
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:14,950
We need Wu Tong’s Soul Bell.

512
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,739
I saw that bell before.

513
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,490
But Brother Wu Tong
doesn’t allow me to touch it.

514
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:25,935
Will you return my primordial spirit
if I steal the bell for you?

515
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,127
Yes.

516
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,079
Fine. I’ll steal the bell, but
you must keep your promise.

517
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,631
- It’s a deal then.
- See you in three days.

518
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,273
And we’ll help the primordial spirits
to return to their bodies.

519
00:32:41,274 --> 00:32:42,494
Okay.

520
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,795
Hurry!

521
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,679
Xuan Ji!

522
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,679
Sixth Senior, we’re outside
of Mount Buzhou now.

523
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,319
How’s your progress?

524
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,559
Everything is going well. Wu Tong
will go on a retreat tomorrow.

525
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,014
That flower demon promised us that
she’ll steal the bell for us.

526
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:30,085
And she’ll help us in
retrieving Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

527
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,159
Min Yan, once you acquire her spirit,
try to find a way out.

528
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,159
We’ll meet you at the altar outside.

529
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,869
Okay. Wait for my good news.

530
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,663
Brother Wu Tong,

531
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:13,536
I can’t bear to part with you.

532
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,892
You’re missing me already?

533
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,230
It’s only for one day. I’ll be back soon.

534
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,588
The back of the mountain is cold.
This shirt is too thin for you.

535
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,279
You should change your shirt.

536
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,070
It’s fine. I won’t be cold.

537
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,789
I’ll be angry if you catch a cold.

538
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,659
Look at your temper.

539
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,999
You’re angry over this?

540
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,590
Fine. I’ll listen to you.

541
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,630
How is it?

542
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:06,072
Are you happy now? Is it thick enough?

543
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:07,274
Much better.

544
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,150
I’ll leave now.

545
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,305
Here.

546
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,559
The Soul Bell.

547
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,005
- I’ve finally obtained it.
- Brother Wu Tong will return tonight.

548
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,719
You better be quick
if you want to escape.

549
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,327
Okay. We’ll start now.

550
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,190
They’re here.

551
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,376
Flying Snake, we have the Soul Bell.

552
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,619
What should we do now?

553
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,967
Flying Snake.

554
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:51,239
Xuan Ji.

555
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,830
Hurry up!

556
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,559
Wait.

557
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,661
Wait, didn’t you say you would
return me my primordial spirit?

558
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,639
What should I do now?

559
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,039
Don’t rush me! We’ll do it one by one!

560
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,310
I need to extract the primordial spirit
in your current body.

561
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,510
Don’t worry. I’ll keep my words.

562
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,278
I know. Actually, you’re not evil.

563
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,906
You should leave Sky Hall

564
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,413
after you retrieve
your own primordial spirit.

565
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,959
It’s hard for you to acquire a human form.

566
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,959
Find a peaceful place
and find a person who truly loves you.

567
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,295
Don’t be too full of yourself.

568
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,697
I did all this because of Brother Tong.

569
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:34,061
After you retrieve
Ling Long’s primordial spirit,

570
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,439
we will be unrelated.

571
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,030
None of you can tell me what to do.

572
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,782
Are you done or not?

573
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,119
I’m going to cast my spell now.

574
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,517
Kid, stand beside that demon.

575
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:44,655
Okay.

576
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,150
Spirit Transfer!

577
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,550
Ling Long, I can finally bring you home.

578
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,314
Min Yan, you mustn’t
delay this any longer.

579
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:43,069
Her primordial spirit needs to
return to her body immediately.

580
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,206
Okay.

581
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,870
What about her?

582
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,159
Stupid.

583
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,399
Just do the same thing I did just now.

584
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,258
Use the Five Elements Spell
and find the correct position.

585
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,493
The flower demon’s element is wood.
Use water element for the spell.

586
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:00,952
When her primordial spirit
returns to her body,

587
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:03,039
she’ll become her original self.

588
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,601
Do what you did?

589
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,276
Flying Snake, I don’t understand at all.

590
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:20,467
Why don’t you do it again?

591
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,399
Flying Snake?

592
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,079
- It’s cut off?
- Cut off?

593
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,519
Flying Snake, can you
try to detect them again?

594
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,679
I don’t know what’s going on.
Maybe the charm fell off.

595
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,139
Anyway, I’ve given him the instructions.
It’s an easy task.

596
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,570
Let’s just wait here.

597
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,595
Flying Snake?

598
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,592
Flying Snake? This is bad.

599
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:47,959
How did the charm disappear?

600
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,319
- I can’t remember the things he taught me.
- It’s fine.

601
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,327
It’s fine. I remember them.

602
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,630
Ruo Yu, it’s lucky that I have you.

603
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:58,639
Let’s return her primordial spirit
to her body now.

604
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,247
Wait, we need to let her
do something for us.

605
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:02,449
What are you doing?

606
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,755
Her primordial spirit is not in her body.

607
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,519
I can use the Jade Flute to hypnotize her
and steal the spirit keys.

608
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,359
Did you plan for that long ago?

609
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,399
Now that Wu Tong isn’t here,
no one will be able to stop Ling Long.

610
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,432
This is a rare chance.

611
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:15,743
You’re using her!

612
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,079
This is our reward for
retrieving her primordial spirit.

613
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,739
We can ask for her help
if we want the spirit keys.

614
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,838
We mustn’t use her to our own advantage!

615
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,659
A gentleman wouldn’t do this.

616
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,320
A gentleman?

617
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:32,840
You severed one of your senior’s arm
in order to join Sky Hall.

618
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,351
Is that what a gentleman would do?

619
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,060
Min Yan, did you forget
what your master told you?

620
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,239
You can do everything it takes
to retrieve the spirit keys.

621
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,919
Besides, the flower demon
won’t be in danger.

622
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,959
We’ve sacrificed so much for this.

623
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,711
If we don’t retrieve the spirit keys,
your Second Senior will die in vain.

624
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,427
Miss Ling Long.

625
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:13,763
This is a forbidden ground. So...

626
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,070
We mustn’t mess with Miss Ling Long.
We’ll die if she gets angry.

627
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,600
Miss Ling Long, please.

628
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,808
- She did retrieve them for us.
- What is this?

629
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,628
This...

630
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,271
This is the Flying Dragon Seal,
a treasure of Lize Palace.

631
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:01,390
I’m sure the spy stole this
together with the spirit key.

632
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,558
I can take this back as well.

633
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:06,479
But why is there only one spirit key?

634
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,112
The spirit keys of Fuyu Island
and Xuanyuan Sect were stolen as well.

635
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,712
There should be three spirit keys here.

636
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:14,223
Don’t tell me they hid the
other two keys in a different place?

637
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,289
It’s our miscalculation.
But now, we’ve alerted them.

638
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,839
Let’s leave first.

639
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,279
Okay. Return her primordial spirit
to her body.

640
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,190
- We’ll leave after that.
- Okay.

641
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,201
- Who’s there?
- Let’s go!

642
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,355
Let’s go!

643
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,950
Where is Sixth Senior?

644
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,470
Let’s check it out.

645
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,679
Everyone, listen up!
I’m sure they’re still around!

646
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,439
- Hurry!
- Go!

647
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,204
I’ll distract them. You leave first.

648
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,519
Ruo Yu, we’ll leave together!

649
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,079
- Xuan Ji and the rest are at the altar.
- There are too many enemies.

650
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,142
If this continues, both of us will die.

651
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,839
I’ll wait for you in Qingmu Town.

652
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,078
Ruo Yu!

653
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:43,816
Ruo Yu!

654
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,776
Sixth Senior!

655
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,177
- Sixth Senior!
- Xuan Ji, Si Feng!

656
00:44:26,178 --> 00:44:28,248
- Go and save Ruo Yu!
- Ruo Yu?

657
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,203
Flying Snake, go and save Ruo Yu.

658
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:32,883
We’ll escape with Min Yan for now.
