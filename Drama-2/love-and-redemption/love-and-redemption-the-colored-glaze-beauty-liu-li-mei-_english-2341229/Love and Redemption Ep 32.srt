00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,399
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 32</i>

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,472
Where have you been?

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
Why did you get back so late?

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,559
Look at you.

6
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
You’re covered in sweats.

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Come here.

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,198
You haven’t said where you have been.

9
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,470
I went to the flower valley.

10
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,069
I wanted to pick some flowers
and make a scented sachet for you.

11
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,560
But I couldn’t find any suitable one.

12
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,799
Oh, the flower valley.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,261
No wonder your hands are cold.

14
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,360
Here.

15
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,879
Drink some tea.

16
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
Warm up your body.

17
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
Have a dessert.

18
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
Your favorite dessert isn’t rice cake,

19
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,440
but osmanthus cake.

20
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,479
I’ll take a walk with you tomorrow.

21
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,629
I’ll bring along
some slaves to play with you too.

22
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,640
I’ve been busy these days.
I haven’t kept you company.

23
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,039
By the way, the disciple from
Shaoyang Sect under the cliff,

24
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
Chen Min Jue...

25
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,640
What’s wrong?

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,780
Eat slowly.

27
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,640
Here.

28
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,982
That Chen Min Jue
has been ignored for days.

29
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,534
Someone has to send him some food.

30
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,080
We can’t let him die.

31
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,524
I need him to restrain Zhong Min Yan.

32
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:12,600
I will go then. I can send food
for him and take a stroll on my way.

33
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay.

34
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
You just have to send this for him.

35
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,200
Master, we’ve brought the items.

36
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,421
This is a little gift for
Shaoyang Sect’s Leader Chu.

37
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:43,320
- Handle with care.
- Yes.

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
Right.

39
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,797
Both of you know the way.

40
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,280
Go with them.

41
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,839
Stop.

42
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,359
You’re just the entourage.
Who told you to come over?

43
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Take it away.

44
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,520
We’ve been searching around for so long,
but not a single demon could be seen.

45
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Looks like it’s another fruitless day.

46
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,479
Si Feng, how are you feeling now?

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,799
Ting Nu said you’ve just recovered.
Your qi might not circulate well.

48
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,359
- You must tell me if you feel unwell.
- Don’t worry.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,680
I won’t push myself.

50
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,599
How come there’s a fire on that mountain?

51
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,046
What caused such a big fire?

52
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,600
Let’s go take a look.

53
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,039
Our entire orchard is destroyed!

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,439
Alright, stop crying!

55
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,839
This is a fire from the heavens.

56
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,799
There’s no use in crying.

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,439
We’re lucky to survive.

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,840
Hurry and go!

59
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,239
Uncle, what’s going on?

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,959
You say this mountain fire
is a fire from the heavens?

61
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,159
It’s a fire from the heavens.
I saw it with my own eyes.

62
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,575
A large fireball fell right on the ground.

63
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:15,799
There’s nothing left. What sins
did we commit for God to kill us?

64
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,280
- Hurry and go!
- Let’s take a look.

65
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,119
Hurry up!

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,198
We must put out the fire quickly,
and save some of the trees and fields.

67
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,756
I’ll set up a formation
to draw water and make it rain.

68
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,947
But Si Feng, using secret arts
to set up formation

69
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:32,919
may sap your vitality.

70
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,000
It’s alright.
I’m just putting out the fire.

71
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,840
The fire has gone out.

72
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,680
Who the hell put out
the fire from me, the god?

73
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,240
Deity?

74
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,399
Two mortals?

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,360
You’ve got a lot of nerve.

76
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,359
I think I’ve seen you somewhere.

77
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,760
In the Mirror of Origin.

78
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,120
You’re the heavenly beast,
Lord Flying Snake from the heavens.

79
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,758
Were it you two who set up the
rain formation and soaked me?

80
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,439
We didn’t know you were here.

81
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,799
I was in a rush to put out the fire,
and so I’ve bothered you.

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,279
Please don’t blame us
for putting out the fire.

83
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,806
I passed by the mortal realm

84
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,086
and noticed this place
needed a heavenly trial,

85
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,279
so I started a fire on the mountain.

86
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,320
This is the fate of nature.

87
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,079
But because of you two being
nosy, the heavenly law is broken.

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,519
What should you do?
Offer up your lives as penance?

89
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,919
What nonsense is that?

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,321
Who are you to decide
the fate of the living beings here?

91
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:16,360
Is it simply because you are a god?

92
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,590
After suffering the fire from the heavens,
this land will become a land of fortune.

93
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,239
The future inhabitants living here
will be thrice blessed.

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,039
They should be thanking me.

95
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,130
You’ve quite the courage,
you stinky woman.

96
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,376
Then what about the people
who lived here originally?

97
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,838
Do you know it was because of you

98
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,200
that they have become homeless,
injured or dead?

99
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,439
This is fate! Fate!
Do you understand? You idiot!

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,553
- You...
- Cut the crap.

101
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,479
Hurry up and say whatever you’ve to say.
Don’t get in my way.

102
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,200
I’m in haste to find someone!

103
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,399
Si Feng!

104
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
- Si Feng!
- He died so easily?

105
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,160
Mortals are weak indeed.

106
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:16,480
Dingkun Sword!

107
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,695
Dingkun Sword?

108
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,600
You are God of War?

109
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,999
I actually bumped into you here.

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
You’ve lost your aura
after becoming a mortal.

111
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,319
I almost didn’t recognize you.

112
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,479
Heaven helps those who help themselves.

113
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,919
1,000 years have passed.

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,839
I’ve been looking for a chance
to have a proper fight with you.

115
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
And see who is better. Bring it on!

116
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,919
I won’t fight with you.

117
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,840
I’m going to kill you.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
Xuan Ji.

119
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,479
Si Feng!

120
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,159
Si Feng, are you alright?

121
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,879
I thought you were dead!
I thought he killed you!

122
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,120
I’m fine.

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
I’m glad you’re fine.

124
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,398
Didn’t you want
to get a powerful spirit beast?

125
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,199
If a beast from the heavens
becomes your spirit beast,

126
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,640
would that be good enough?

127
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,719
That’s not fair!

128
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,680
You’re insulting a heavenly beast!
This won’t end here!

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,429
But Si Feng, I don’t really like him.

130
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,614
He’s not nice at all.

131
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:46,884
If he becomes my spirit beast,
will he behave well?

132
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,414
Never!
Stinky woman, just drop that idea!

133
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,662
Of course. Once you become his master,
he’ll be your spirit beast.

134
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:56,719
He can’t go against his master’s command.

135
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,853
After this, he won’t bother you
into fighting him.

136
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,520
He’ll listen to you.

137
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,400
Lord Flying Snake, don’t cause disturbance
in mortal realm anymore.

138
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,204
Sounds good.

139
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,800
What should I do?

140
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,560
Xuan Ji, give me your hand.

141
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Don’t you dare!
I’ll turn you two into skewers!

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,479
What is this?

143
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,719
Why I’ve never seen you use it?

144
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,023
This is a Blood Soul Pearl
made up of your blood and his.

145
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,661
This Flying Snake is very mischievous,
and hard to tame.

146
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:53,040
It’ll be easier with this pearl.

147
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,653
I...

148
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:58,862
No. I’ll fight you to the death.

149
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,319
Xuan Ji.

150
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
Squeeze it.

151
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
Squeeze again.

152
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,800
Call his name.

153
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,720
Flying Snake.

154
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,239
I, Flying Snake, pay respect to master.

155
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,679
All done.

156
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,488
Both of you have created a blood pact.

157
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,320
From now on, you’re his master.

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,559
You’re my spirit beast
in the future, okay?

159
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,378
We’re family now.

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
Sir, please come in.

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,839
Silver Snake is my spirit beast.

162
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,901
She’s experienced in being a spirit beast.

163
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,840
She’ll teach you some manners.

164
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,878
Xuan Ji and I are going in
to see if there’s any private room.

165
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,341
We’ll get some water to clean your face.

166
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,600
It’s the same for you.

167
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,517
His spirit beast is a stink rat snake?

168
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,993
Asking a stink rat snake to teach me
is a humiliation!

169
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,414
I’m not a stink rat snake.

170
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,502
I’m Chinese krait snake.

171
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:21,239
Who cares what kind of snake you are?

172
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,720
I’m a stupid snake if I don’t leave now.

173
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,921
- You don’t need a sword to fly?
- Duh!

174
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,341
I’m a heavenly beast.

175
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:40,579
A god.

176
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,399
How can I be compared
to a lower creature like you?

177
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,399
It’s useless. Without master’s consent,
you can’t go far

178
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,319
before your qi fails you,
and your blood goes the wrong way.

179
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,960
How far can I go then?

180
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
That’s the furthest you can go.

181
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,430
Si Feng.

182
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,605
Chu Xuan Ji.

183
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,719
Why is your face so dirty?

184
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,319
I can’t clean it.

185
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,399
I’ll help you clean it then.

186
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
Come here.

187
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,200
Come here.

188
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,400
It’s not done yet.

189
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,020
What happened to your brow?

190
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,719
It was burned by the fire before.
Now it’s gone.

191
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,399
What should I do? Is it hideous?

192
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,085
- Yes, very ugly.
- Really?

193
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,520
Is it not?

194
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,159
Is it ugly?

195
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Say it again.

196
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,320
Serves you right.

197
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,240
Come here.

198
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,622
Si Feng.

199
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,840
You know how to draw on brows?

200
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,679
I was forced to learn it.

201
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,679
Brother Liu told me
that it might come in handy.

202
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,759
I never imagined it to be useful now.

203
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,599
This is my first time drawing
for you, so I’m not good at it yet.

204
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,439
I’ll draw a nice brow for you eventually.

205
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,199
- Don’t move.
- It’s ticklish.

206
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,519
I might give you a yaksha eyebrow.

207
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,920
Almost done.

208
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,037
Si Feng, my father
used to tell me

209
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,960
that he helped my mother with
her brows too when they were young.

210
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,960
Your father and mother are different.

211
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,480
Done, take a look.

212
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,919
So pretty. Si Feng, you’re so great.

213
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,591
- So clever.
Sir.

214
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:02,286
Take a look outside quickly.

215
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,629
- What’s the matter?
- The gray-haired man who came with you

216
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,765
is going to destroy the whole street.

217
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,120
Flying Snake?

218
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,960
Flying Snake!

219
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:34,720
- Why is he...
- I’m in a bad mood today, so you’ll have to suffer.

220
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,680
Flying Snake!

221
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,389
Flying Snake, what are you doing? Stop!

222
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,279
You want me to stay
by your side, right? Fine!

223
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,000
I won’t let you have a day of peace.

224
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,479
Where does the troublemaker come from?

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,760
Indeed, where did he come from?

226
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,079
Listen. Every injustice
has its perpetrator.

227
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,239
The person right there is Chu Xuan Ji.
She’s my master.

228
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,399
Everything was done under her command.
Go talk with her.

229
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,559
Oh right, don’t let her off.

230
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,335
- Why did you let your servant hurt others?
- When did I...

231
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,399
I didn’t!

232
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,358
Stop there! Compensate me for my stock!
Compensate me for my wine!

233
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,520
I’ll pay for it.
Alright, I’ll pay for all the losses.

234
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,400
Okay.

235
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,599
Fine.

236
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,039
You’ve money, is it?

237
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,766
You mortals. Good then.

238
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,960
I’ll demolish the entire street!

239
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,215
- Stinky woman, what are you doing?
- Flying Snake!

240
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:51,519
Didn’t Silver Snake teach you that

241
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
as a spirit beast, you’re not allowed
to hurt your master.

242
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,461
You’ll hurt yourself instead.

243
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,159
And the consequences are grave.

244
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,679
I don’t believe it! Fine.

245
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,600
I won’t cast any spell. I’ll use my fists.

246
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,959
What’s wrong? Is it a massage?

247
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,280
Come, here.

248
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
I was so worn out lately. Come, here.

249
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,559
I’m exhausted.

250
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,879
- I’m going to eat.
- Stop there!

251
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,758
You haven’t apologized for what you did.

252
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,199
As my spirit beast,
you can’t behave the way you do

253
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,799
to bully the weak and do as you wish.

254
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,740
You want me to apologize?

255
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,399
- I refuse!
- Are you going to apologize or not?

256
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Apologize my...

257
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,839
He got on his knees to apologize,
for what he did to all of you just now.

258
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,039
Don’t worry. He would never do it again.

259
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,639
Stinky woman.

260
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,400
Throw away the pearl and
fight one on one with me if you dare!

261
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,704
Stop right there! Come back!

262
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,800
Don’t go!

263
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
I have my pride!

264
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,880
Don’t you laugh! I’m telling you...

265
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,000
Time to eat.

266
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,926
You!

267
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,200
How can you be so violent
when you’re at fault?

268
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,334
Being insolent after making mistakes?
Starve yourself then!

269
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:49,814
Do as you like!

270
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:53,040
Just leave your wound like that!

271
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,240
How can you laugh?

272
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:10,960
Why is your spirit beast so obedient,
but mine is like that?

273
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:14,839
Of course.

274
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,639
Not everyone can get a spirit
beast as good as me, right?

275
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,014
Don’t quarrel with him all the time.
You should get along with him.

276
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:24,799
Look at him huddling himself there,
refusing to eat and drink.

277
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,560
Doesn’t he look like a stray puppy
that you just picked up?

278
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,397
A little.

279
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:33,638
You see, if you just picked up
a stray puppy,

280
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,118
wouldn’t it bare its teeth at you?

281
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,302
It wants to bite you, but it can’t.
Neither can it eat.

282
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:41,278
Isn’t it quite pathetic now?

283
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,160
What do you think you should do?

284
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,278
I’ll put it in my arms and rub its head.

285
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,573
That’s right.

286
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:52,399
Treat him like a dog and tame him.

287
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,246
He’s not even a human,
so we can’t train him like one.

288
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:59,039
If he doesn’t behave well,
just spank him on his butt.

289
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,999
If he does, give him a hug then.

290
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,869
He’s not a human anyway.
We can’t train him like a human.

291
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,021
Here. This is a breed guide
to spirit beast.

292
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,615
I’m giving it to you now.

293
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:11,519
Do what the book says,
and you’ll master it eventually.

294
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,239
You’re so smart.

295
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,480
Okay.

296
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
This is Shaoyang’s secret vulnerary.

297
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,045
It’s very effective.
Even though I’m very mad today,

298
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,639
we still have to treat your wound.

299
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,629
Otherwise, it may get worse.

300
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,799
Listen.

301
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,669
Don’t ever think a small favor like this
can make me give in.

302
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,443
I’m a heavenly beast.

303
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,078
I despise mortals’ behavior.

304
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,319
Who told you to give in?

305
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Although you’re my spirit beast,
we can still be friends.

306
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,000
From now onward, I’ll protect you.

307
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,159
What are you doing?

308
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,159
You treated me like a dog,
and rubbed my head?

309
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,279
Only King and Jade Emperor
can touch my head!

310
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
Alright.

311
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,678
Are you hungry?
I don’t know what you would like to eat

312
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,526
but Silver Snake said you like eating.

313
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,760
Wait here, I’ll get it for you.

314
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,959
Put it away! What are you doing?

315
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,359
Who do you think I am?

316
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,239
I’ve been a god for thousands of years!

317
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,544
The stink rat snake that just crawled out
from the snake nest and I

318
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,079
are different!

319
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,719
- That’s not what I meant.
- That’s not what you meant?

320
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,949
What’s this?

321
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,079
You want to tame me like a pet?

322
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,279
Chu Xuan Ji, I’m telling you, it’s
better to die than be humiliated!

323
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,366
Alright. Don’t be mad.

324
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:44,759
Let’s bury the hatchet, okay?

325
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,160
What’s done is done,
I’ll reluctantly keep you as spirit beast.

326
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,504
You reluctantly keep me as spirit beast?

327
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:04,239
I’m obviously the one in agony here, okay?

328
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,261
Hurry and break the blood pact!

329
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,502
No!

330
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:11,199
You know it well
that unless you cut off my arm,

331
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,400
this blood pact can’t be undone.

332
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:17,280
It is what it is now,
and there’s no room for us to regret.

333
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,839
I don’t care!

334
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,486
Let me tell you, Chu Xuan Ji.

335
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,519
No matter what, I will leave.

336
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,640
Little Snake, catch it.

337
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,199
You’re not a fool.
Now that the blood pact has been made,

338
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,679
why still throw a tantrum?

339
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,237
Besides, she won’t embarrass you
as an owner

340
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:37,134
and this is more intriguing than
staying in the heavens.

341
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,159
I know you sneaked to the mortal realm.

342
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,879
You said you passed by mortal realm
and set the woods on fire,

343
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,479
but most likely you caused the accident.

344
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,519
I know you’re worried the heavens
will look into it,

345
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,999
that’s why you did it.

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,760
However, Xuan Ji got you
out of a fix anyway.

347
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:52,999
Mind reader!

348
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,589
You can read minds!

349
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,715
Of course I don’t know how to read mind.

350
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:59,421
But the heavens never
interferes with mortal affairs,

351
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,288
You said you came for the God of War.

352
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:05,118
So, it appears that Lord Flying Snake
is such a wild and unruly god?

353
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,360
You!

354
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,799
You’re all dismissed.

355
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,480
I’m tired.

356
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,751
Drink with me.

357
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:26,919
How did it go?

358
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,880
Did you get the ring from Sky Hall?

359
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,936
We searched everywhere but found nothing.

360
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:34,582
They seem to have been more careful now.

361
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,718
The trip isn’t utterly fruitless.

362
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,461
Xuan Ji got herself a spirit beast.

363
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:39,759
Spirit beast?

364
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,960
Spirit beast?

365
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,445
Why isn’t he coming in?

366
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,720
Flying Snake.

367
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,150
Let me introduce you.

368
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,759
This is my best friend, Ting Nu.

369
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,719
This is Liu Yi Huan, Brother Liu.

370
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,320
- This is...
- Lord Flying Snake.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,846
You’re quite knowledgeable.

372
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,640
At least you know me.

373
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,240
You...

374
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,520
You stole the celestial eye? How dare you!

375
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,000
You’re from the heavens?

376
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,966
I’m the most promising officer
in the heavens.

377
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,839
If I report to the heavens
about what happened here,

378
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,840
all of you will be in serious trouble.

379
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,679
I’ve been on the run for so long to
avoid being caught by the heavens.

380
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,143
I’m doomed.

381
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:41,288
I’m so scared.

382
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:44,120
If you’re scared, quickly tell
the woman to let me go.

383
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,920
Do you take me for a fool?

384
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,318
You are Chu Xuan Ji’s spirit beast now.

385
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,680
There’s no way you can tell on me!

386
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,519
It’s even more dangerous to let you go.
Little Xuan Ji, well done!

387
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,840
Don’t ever let him go for my sake.

388
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,862
You people...

389
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,680
You! I remember you now.

390
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,854
You’re the merman medic
banished to the mortal realm.

391
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,124
Aren’t you?

392
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,399
Lord Flying Snake, it’s very kind of you

393
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,664
to remember an
insignificant merman like me.

394
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,519
Shut up! You’re all demons.

395
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,959
Where did you keep Wu Zhi Qi?

396
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,894
I want to fight with him!

397
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,934
Flying Snake! You’re too noisy!

398
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,359
Treat my friends better!

399
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,320
And also, why do you want
to fight with everyone?

400
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,240
One day, I’m going to
arrest each and all of you!

401
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,159
Lord Flying Snake, would you like me
to pick a room for you?

402
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,440
I’ll take whichever room I like!

403
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,438
You silly snake,
you can’t get out this way.

404
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:21,341
How about this?
Since we’re of the same species,

405
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,839
- I’ll give you a hand.
- What can you do?

406
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,479
You can’t cast spell to hurt your master,

407
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,560
but I wonder if you can use poison.

408
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,400
Here is a bottle of Soul Entry
that I stole from Liu Yi Huan.

409
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,301
Do you want to give it a try?

410
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:40,720
This is a great idea.

411
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,753
No. That stinky woman is the God of War.

412
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:49,919
If I stealthily poisoned her to death,
isn’t it a dirty trick?

413
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,880
Besides, if I kill her,

414
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,719
who else can I fight with?

415
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,476
That’s why I say you’re stupid.

416
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,599
I didn’t tell you to kill her with poison.

417
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,593
She won’t die if you control
the amount of poison you use.

418
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:04,800
When she passes out,
you can just cut off her arm.

419
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,622
Never mind.
I think I shouldn’t give you the poison.

420
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:14,399
I want! I want it!

421
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,656
Okay. Remember,
don’t tell anyone that I helped you.

422
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:22,124
Otherwise if my master knows about this,
he’ll never forgive me.

423
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:26,286
Don’t worry. Since you went all
out to help me, I, Lord Flying Snake,

424
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,400
am not an unfaithful person.

425
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:30,656
Okay.

426
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Go then.

427
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,439
Flying Snake, why aren’t you sleeping yet?

428
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,190
Stinky woman, this is such an
exciting moment, how can I fall asleep?

429
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,239
You’ve such a powerful spirit beast now.

430
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,120
Let’s have a drink or two to celebrate!

431
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,040
Have you decided to stay?

432
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,846
Drink it first! Perhaps I’ll feel happy
after two cups

433
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:06,120
and decide to stay.

434
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

435
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,559
Nice wine.

436
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
- One more.
- One more cup.

437
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,119
It’s really good.

438
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,959
Drink some more.

439
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,386
You can have the whole jug.

440
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,680
Why isn’t she drunk yet?

441
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,119
Flying Snake.

442
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,606
What happened to your face?

443
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,174
What happened to my face?

444
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:56,709
It’s very handsome.

445
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,150
Handsome?

446
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,639
You’re...

447
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,000
What?

448
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,680
My handsome face...

449
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Flying Snake!

450
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Wake up!

451
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,040
Ghost!

452
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:41,439
Come back!

453
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,079
Look at me. It’s me, Flying Snake.

454
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,719
Quick. Give me the cure
for your Soul Entry.

455
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
Soul Entry?

456
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,839
You’re poisoned with my Soul Entry?

457
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,439
Yes. Hurry and give me the cure!

458
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,559
- I’m so hideous!
- Impossible.

459
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,959
If you’re poisoned by Soul Entry,
you would be dead by now.

460
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,280
Besides,

461
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,960
my Soul Entry is right here.

462
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
But my Seven Venoms Face Wrecker is gone.

463
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,479
Have you mistaken Seven Venoms Face
Wrecker as Soul Entry and consumed it?

464
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,559
No. I don’t care whatever it is!

465
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,344
Give me the cure!

466
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,279
This Seven Venoms Face Wrecker
is the first bottle I made.

467
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,670
There’s no cure for it.

468
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,240
- Flying Snake.
- No cure?

469
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,445
But don’t you worry,
my Seven Venom Face Wrecker

470
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:25,159
is made up of the stingers of
seven different poisonous wasps

471
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,279
Those poisoned will only
have swollen face,

472
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,199
festered wound which will form scabs,

473
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,519
and become uglier and uglier.
But it’s not fatal.

474
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,999
You won’t die.

475
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,240
If you really die,

476
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:40,000
it’s caused by the shame of your ugliness.

477
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,720
You...

478
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
But Flying Snake...

479
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,839
Why would you steal a
bottle of poison and drink it?

480
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,799
I guess he intended to poison you,

481
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,479
but stole the Seven Venoms
Face Wrecker instead.

482
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,439
And he never expected that the
spirit beast will suffer the backlash.

483
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,580
He had truly shot himself in the foot.

484
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:10,880
Is that really what you want to do?

485
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:15,145
So what if I have done it?

486
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,161
So what if I haven’t done it?

487
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,759
It’s all because of you, stinky woman!

488
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,637
If you didn’t rack your brain and conspire
to make me your spirit beast,

489
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,880
would I end up like this?

490
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:33,112
I, Lord Flying Snake, used
to be the most promising

491
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,599
and handsome officer in the heavens.

492
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,364
But now I’m being tortured by mortals,
and become so hideous!

493
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:41,960
I want to die!

494
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,974
There’s a song about secret arts
in the heavens.

495
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,414
You can sing it too, right?

496
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,382
You’ve become Xuan Ji’s spirit beast

497
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,706
because fate brought you together.

498
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:53,118
I thought you were a god who
is willing to accept failure,

499
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,039
so I showed you some respect.
But never had I expected you

500
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,806
to think of such a cheap shot.

501
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,520
I see you in a different light now.

502
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,200
Xuan Ji, since he won’t
die, just leave him alone.

503
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,600
Brother Liu, is there really
no way to help him?

504
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,840
It’s not completely impossible.

505
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,776
Quickly tell me how you can cure me!

506
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,239
That depends on whether your master
is willing to save you or not.

507
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,319
You’re Xuan Ji’s spirit beast now,
and you share a blood pact.

508
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,915
So Xuan Ji’s blood
is certainly the best cure.

509
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:31,344
If Xuan Ji is willing to use her blood
to force out your poisonous blood,

510
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:34,559
- then your poison will be cured.
- Don’t do it, Xuan Ji.

511
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,120
A spirit beast that hurts his master
deserves some kind of punishment.

512
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,999
Don’t worry.

513
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,776
I won’t beg her to save me.

514
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:46,720
If I beg her to save me,
I’ll be admitting her as my master.

515
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,200
I would rather be ugly forever.

516
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,640
Stinky woman! What are you doing?

517
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,519
You’re still my spirit beast now.

518
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,920
I’ve told you, I’ll protect you.

519
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,440
Even if you give me your blood,
I still won’t accept you as my master.

520
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,150
I’m not saving you to make you stay.

521
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:28,080
I just can’t bear to see your ugly face!

522
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,479
I’m warning you, stinky woman!

523
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,719
Don’t force me!

524
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,724
Hurry! Open your mouth! Finish it,
and return to the heavens.

525
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,160
What did you say?

526
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:44,119
Since you’re so unwilling,
I don’t want to force you too.

527
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,919
I’ve a lot of things to do every day.
I don’t have time to bicker with you.

528
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,261
But if you really want to cut off my arm,
I’m unwilling to do that as well.

529
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:54,333
How about this?
I allow you to leave me indefinitely.

530
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,079
A mortal’s life is very short.

531
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,271
A day in the heavens
is a year in mortal realm.

532
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:01,400
Stay there for a dozen days,
and you can regain your freedom.

533
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:05,247
Are you really willing to let me go?

534
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,720
If I let you save me,

535
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:14,040
wouldn’t I lose my face then?

536
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,109
Face?

537
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,031
You’ve lost your features now,
what face do you want?

538
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,800
Think carefully.

539
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:26,134
At first, I kept you as my spirit beast
because I wanted to save my friend.

540
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:28,312
I didn’t expect you to be so unwilling.

541
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:32,199
Perhaps there’s no fate between us.
I can’t insist on it.

542
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,319
After all,
you’re not the only one in the world

543
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,399
who can be my spirit beast.

544
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,879
You don’t want me,
I don’t want you either!

545
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,800
Hurry up! Finish up your cure,
and go back to the heavens happily.

546
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,040
Let’s go, Si Feng.

547
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,383
Hurry up!

548
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:03,625
It’s just a minor injury.

549
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:05,560
Don’t move.

550
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,799
Had I known earlier,
I wouldn’t help you get Flying Snake.

551
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,820
I didn’t know it would be so troublesome.

552
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,880
I don’t mind your troubles.

553
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:21,720
I just regret that you put
all your attention on him.

554
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,550
You are even jealous of a spirit beast?

555
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,080
Jealousy is jealousy,

556
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,160
it doesn’t matter who the other person is.

557
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,800
Aren’t you going to comfort me?

558
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
Is this okay?

559
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
I don’t want this kind of comfort.

560
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,880
I want this kind of comfort in the future.

561
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,840
Si Feng.

562
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,399
Flying Snake is leaving soon anyway.

563
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Nobody will disturb us anymore.

564
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,600
You really give up on him?

565
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,880
There’s no point in forcing him.

566
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:33,960
What if he’s willing to stay?

567
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:36,959
How is that possible?

568
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,557
I’ve heard some rumors about Flying Snake.

569
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:44,439
Perhaps I know a way to help you.

570
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,800
What is it?

571
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:51,040
Both of you have similar interests.

572
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,399
Flying Snake.

573
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,439
Aren’t you leaving?
I won’t ask you to stay for a meal then.

574
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,800
Hurry and go.

575
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,639
What’s this? It smells so nice.

576
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,758
It’s just a dish made of old hen soup,
and simmered for a dozen hours.

577
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:48,719
I put some pickled bamboo shoots,
abalone and sausages.

578
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
Si Feng, I want to eat that.

579
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,719
And what is this?

580
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,396
This is a specialty here, Spring Carp.

581
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:02,639
I used perilla to remove the fishy smell,
and added some veined rapa whelk.

582
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,880
Taste it first.

583
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,200
Delicious.

584
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,079
What else is in there?

585
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,679
A roasted leg of lamb cooked
until golden brown on one side.

586
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,960
Then, I cut off the other side and
put in star anise and orange peel.

587
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,959
Add in a pinch of red
chili and a pinch of cumin

588
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,400
Grill it over low flame.
We can eat it tonight.

589
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,640
But someone can’t eat it.

590
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,286
Why?

591
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,680
I can leave after I eat.

592
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,640
Aren’t you going back to the heavens?
Hurry and go then.

593
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,360
So delicious.

594
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:56,438
Is everything in the mortal realm
as good as this?

595
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:57,787
Certainly!

596
00:41:57,788 --> 00:42:00,446
Only a few mortals can cook so well.

597
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:02,280
Si Feng is one of them.

598
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,440
It seems like mortal realm is nice too.

599
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,800
Aren’t you going back to the heavens?
Go on your way.

600
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,399
Will I leave just because you tell me to?

601
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,953
Something is wrong with me.

602
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:18,181
I like to do the exact opposite
of what others tell me to do.

603
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,440
You want me to leave, I won’t leave then.

604
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,006
- You’re really staying?
- After all,

605
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,599
you mortals only live for several decades.

606
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,719
I’ll play with you for a period of time.

607
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,239
What harm is there?

608
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,259
But you have to promise that
I’ll have delicious food every day.

609
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,719
If there’s no delicious food,
then I might just leave.

610
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,559
You’re really staying?

611
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,759
Why do you have so much to say?
I won’t repeat my words!

612
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,999
Okay then. Since you’re staying,
enjoy yourself.

613
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,440
Here.

614
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,040
Si Feng, you should have some too.

615
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,070
You two...

616
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,359
Enough.

617
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,720
Just a normal routine.

618
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,855
Suit yourself then. Continue.

619
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:02,560
Just leave me the good food.

620
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,639
Food in the mortal realm is good.

621
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,319
Food in the heavens is not.

622
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,925
It’s like eating mud, and it’s tasteless.

623
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:15,813
Yes. Pretty things are usually fake.

624
00:43:15,814 --> 00:43:17,120
That’s right.

625
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:21,919
You know the saying too?
The King often says that

626
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,065
those that look pretty, and
alluring are usually unreliable.

627
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:29,963
Bailing?

628
00:43:29,964 --> 00:43:33,679
When I was in the Mirror of Origin,
I saw the King too.

629
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,320
But who is he?

630
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,880
So you’re really that stupid
that you don’t even remember the King?

631
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,635
Tell me!

632
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:50,879
You’re ignorant.

633
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,307
The King is King Bailing.

634
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:55,999
If he didn’t plead for you,
you would’ve died long ago.

635
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,640
How could you be sitting here
asking me who the King is?

636
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,958
The King pleaded for me?

637
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,160
Yes.

638
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,280
At that time, Old Guy said
that you were madly in love with the King.

639
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:13,159
But after you fell from the heavens
to go through trials,

640
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,656
you’ve left everything behind?

641
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:19,318
You found this pretty boy in an instant
and forgot about the King?

642
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:20,479
Bai...

643
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,901
I love the King?

644
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,720
Who is the Old Guy? He made it up, right?

645
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:29,390
It’s because it was an unrequited love,
so you got mad

646
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,038
and hated the entire heavens.

647
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,479
You even plotted a rebel,
that was why you were banished,

648
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,960
and have to go through trials again.
Have you forgotten all of these?

649
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,159
You say Xuan Ji was sent to mortal realm
as she fell in love and broke the rules?

650
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
Why? Are you jealous?

651
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,958
The King is God.

652
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:53,840
He can’t be compared to a mortal like you.

653
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,038
So what if he’s a mortal?
If I wasn’t banished to the mortal realm,

654
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,559
I wouldn’t have met Si Feng.

655
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,040
I don’t care who he is.

656
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:04,236
In this whole world, Si Feng is the best.

657
00:45:04,237 --> 00:45:07,600
If you look down on food made
by mortals, stop eating then!

658
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,839
Whatever. As long as you promise
he’ll make good food for me every day.

659
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,126
Whether you love the King,
or the pretty boy,

660
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:15,399
it’s none of my business.

661
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,446
As for the matter
about saving your friend,

662
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:22,680
I can force myself
to do you a small favor.

663
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Give me the food! It’s all mine!
