00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,264
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:32,888
<i>EPISODE 20</i>

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,470
Sixth Senior!

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,119
Xuan Ji!

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,239
Min Yan, have you found Ling Long?

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,873
No!

7
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,584
Let’s slay these demons
before anything else.

8
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,199
How dare you barge in
when you have so few people?

9
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,839
You’re digging your own grave!

10
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,030
I need to give you
a warm welcome since you made it here.

11
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,145
Attack!

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,690
Senior Hao Chen?

13
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,230
I’ll punish you when we return.

14
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,700
Demon, how dare you hurt my junior?

15
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,559
You’re digging your own grave.

16
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,015
You sounded pretty arrogant.

17
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,773
Don’t think you can escape
by breaking through my Soul Sonar.

18
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,319
You became a demon instead of a human
when you had the chance.

19
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,750
Attack!

20
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,536
Yu’er?

21
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,984
A demon spirit?

22
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,999
Ling Long!

23
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,234
Ling Long!

24
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,625
Let her go!

25
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,839
Scoundrel! What did you do to her?

26
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,161
Zhong Min Yan,

27
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,252
you lost to me before.
You’re overestimating your abilities.

28
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:06,601
Are you anxious?

29
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,083
It’s a pity that you’re too late.

30
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,584
Sixth Senior!

31
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,955
Sixth Senior!

32
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,710
What are you trying to do?

33
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,550
I’m sure Second Senior is inside!

34
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,687
Xuan Ji!

35
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,179
Xuan Ji!

36
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,670
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

37
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,879
You made me worried.

38
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,319
You were almost crushed
by the closing entrance.

39
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,751
- I just wanted to save him.
- You need to care for your own safety!

40
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,662
Do you understand?

41
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,994
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

42
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,359
Hero Yu, I have
several questions.

43
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,118
Where did you get the news?

44
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,378
How did you manage
to find this place before us?

45
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,279
Why did you bring my junior here
without informing the sect leaders?

46
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,533
And, why did you save that demon spirit?

47
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,244
Don’t tell me you know that demon spirit?

48
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,179
I have the Sound Bell with me.

49
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,919
That’s why we came here
earlier than you.

50
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,359
We wanted to save Ling Long.

51
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,385
We came here right after we got the news.

52
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,792
We didn’t have time to report the news.

53
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:23,977
As for that demon spirit,

54
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,946
I have never seen her before.

55
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,942
I was standing in front of her
by coincidence.

56
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,764
Senior Hao Chen, you’re thinking too much.

57
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,550
You’re full of deceit
and you’re always hiding something.

58
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,679
Xuan Ji,

59
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,622
it’s okay if you become friends
with an honest guy like Min Yan.

60
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:42,024
I won’t reject that.

61
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,870
But for fake people like him,

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,039
we should avoid them.

63
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,830
Senior Hao Chen, Si Feng isn’t like that.

64
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,151
This is bad.
This place is going to collapse.

65
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,498
Let’s leave.

66
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,004
Your fellow disciples
had ruined my new hideout.

67
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,759
I can only bring you to the headquarters.

68
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,139
Someone!

69
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,035
- Bring him away. Give him a warm welcome.
- Yes.

70
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,879
My lord, she’s with the
disciples of Shaoyang Sect.

71
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,199
I’ve seen her before.

72
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,999
No! I’m a demon spirit!

73
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,030
I’m trying to seek refuge in Sky Hall.

74
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,053
You’re trying to seek refuge?

75
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,404
Sure.

76
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,119
I’ll grant you your wish.

77
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,230
- Lock her up in the cell!
- Yes!

78
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,092
No! Don’t lock me up! Let me go!

79
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,479
I’m really here to seek refuge!

80
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,079
My lord, our plans were
disrupted before we got the chance

81
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,071
to send the severed hand
in exchange for the spirit key.

82
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,622
If our lord knows about this, we’ll...

83
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,460
I still have other plans.

84
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,611
Your master won’t be able to blame me.

85
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,239
Junior, how is she?

86
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,686
Senior, don’t worry.

87
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,199
Ling Long is not poisoned and
she doesn’t have any serious injury.

88
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,519
She’ll be fine.

89
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,599
I think she was just shocked.
She’ll be fine after some rest.

90
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,010
- Good.
- This is great.

91
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,103
It’s good that Ling Long is fine.

92
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,654
We should let her sleep now.

93
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,159
That’s great.

94
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,846
That baddie Wu Tong is too much.

95
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,077
I wonder where’s Second Senior right now?

96
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,342
We managed to save Ling
Long, but we lost Min Jue.

97
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,247
What is Wu Tong plotting?

98
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,390
- Min Yan!
- Sixth Senior!

99
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,626
- Sixth Senior!
- Min Yan!

100
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,799
Senior, this is Five Poisons Palm!

101
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,399
It is a very potent skill.

102
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,698
If we don’t neutralize the poison soon,
he’ll be in danger.

103
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,159
I heard that we need five types

104
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,758
of poisonous herbs to dispel its poison.

105
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,056
Yes. But first, we need to figure out
the five poisons in his body right now.

106
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,354
Only then, we can make the cure.

107
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:16,799
We need some time for this.

108
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,444
I hope Min Yan can stay strong.

109
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,345
Min Xing, bring him to the room beside us.

110
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,647
- Yes.
- Here.

111
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,786
Sixth Senior, don’t worry.

112
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:34,485
We will neutralize your poison.

113
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:36,516
And we will find the cure for you.

114
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,144
Senior.

115
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
Si Feng?

116
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,639
You’re awake?

117
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,782
Have you identified the five poisons
found within Min Yan?

118
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,182
Yes.

119
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,239
We’ve made the cure as well.

120
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,722
But inside it, there’s one special
ingredient called Yin Yang Grass.

121
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,545
Its poisonous nature
will change regularly.

122
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,180
And different time will have
a different effect on its nature.

123
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,051
What will be the consequences then?

124
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,291
If it has a Yang nature,

125
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:38,079
it can neutralize Min Yan’s poison when
you mix it with the other four poison.

126
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,470
But if it has a Yin nature,
it will clash with the other poisons.

127
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,380
And this will cause Min Yan
to die instantly.

128
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,641
Do we have a way to
find out about its nature then?

129
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,919
Sect Leader, maybe you don’t know this.

130
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
This is precisely why we’re worried.
There’s no way to tell

131
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,959
which nature it has.

132
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,500
That’s why, we need someone
to test the concoction.

133
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,124
It’s just that it is concocted with
poisonous herbs.

134
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,683
It will harm the test subject as well.

135
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,039
Especially...

136
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,444
If it has a Yin nature,

137
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:15,435
it will reduce the
test subject’s power to nothing.

138
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,397
And I haven’t figured out a solution yet.

139
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,188
But time is not on Min Yan’s side.

140
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,152
- I’ll be the test subject.
- No.

141
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,639
The concoction is very poisonous.

142
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,359
If it has a Yin nature,
it will reduce your power to nothing.

143
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,766
Now, I mustn’t let anyone else
be in trouble.

144
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,959
But you need a test subject somehow.

145
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,044
Xuan Ji, I know.

146
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,321
You’re most concerned about Min Yan.

147
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:42,219
But this is a special case.
You’ll be in danger if you do this.

148
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,374
Sixth Senior took great care
of Ling Long and I.

149
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,959
Now, it’s my turn to do something for him.

150
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,327
Let me be the test subject.

151
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,599
No!

152
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,886
Si Feng!

153
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,110
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

154
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,407
Si Feng, you...

155
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,318
It’s my chance to help my brother out.

156
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:02,599
Of course it needs to be me.

157
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,359
Si Feng!

158
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,910
Si Feng, are you okay?
Please don’t scare me.

159
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,630
Si Feng!

160
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,501
Si Feng!

161
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,491
Si Feng!

162
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,525
Si Feng!

163
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,625
How is it?

164
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,178
It has a Yang nature. This will work.

165
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Swallow this Vitality Pill.

166
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,501
Si Feng,

167
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,150
you don’t look too well.
Let me send you back to your room.

168
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:05,225
I’m fine.

169
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,687
I just need to recuperate on my own.

170
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,964
I’ll return by myself.

171
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:12,039
Hurry and give Min Yan the cure.

172
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,889
No, I must send you back first.

173
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,719
Xuan Ji, this is a potent
poison. We mustn’t be careless.

174
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,753
All of us are here. Don’t worry.

175
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,990
Send Si Feng back and take care of him.

176
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,427
Si Feng, let’s go.

177
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,999
Xuan Ji, I’m fine.

178
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,536
You should return now.

179
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,302
No. You need to rest well.

180
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,079
Why didn’t you
let me drink the concoction?

181
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,727
Sixth Senior is my senior.

182
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,478
Logically, I should be the test subject.

183
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,276
Min Yan is my good brother as well.

184
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,067
Why can’t I be the test subject?

185
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,350
I wonder how he’s doing right now?
You should go and check.

186
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,559
But what about you?

187
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,972
I’m fine.

188
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,175
I need to recuperate.

189
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:20,999
It’s not convenient for me
when you’re here.

190
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,682
- I...
- Go now.

191
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,699
Fine.

192
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,850
But you must tell me
if you feel uncomfortable, okay?

193
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,941
Okay.

194
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,830
Aunt Ying Hong, how’s Sixth Senior?

195
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,488
The poison is too strong.

196
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,520
Although the poison has been neutralized,

197
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:12,671
his body can’t force out
the remaining poison.

198
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,239
Sect Leader, Aunt Ying Hong,

199
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,878
rumor has it that the Freezing Pond
in Fuyu Island can help people to recover.

200
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,007
Why don’t we try it?

201
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,524
The pond may be able to
force the poison out of Min Yan’s body.

202
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,152
We can try that.

203
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,059
Okay.

204
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,090
I’ll ask Lord Dong Fang right now.

205
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,635
It’s freezing!

206
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,567
The Freezing Pond is cold indeed.

207
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:47,830
The poison will disappear
after a few days.

208
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,863
But this place is extremely cold as well.

209
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,619
During this period, we need
someone to keep an eye on him.

210
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,639
I’ll stay here and
take care of Sixth Senior.

211
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,831
I’m not afraid of the cold. I’ll be fine.

212
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,359
Si Feng.

213
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,490
Si Feng.

214
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,358
I came to visit because I heard that
you tried the poisonous concoction.

215
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,679
How are you feeling?

216
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,439
I’ve adjusted my internal breathing.
I’m fine now.

217
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,759
That’s good.

218
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,468
If our palace lord hears about
this, he’ll throw a fit again.

219
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,248
I’ve experienced the harshest
punishment in Lize Palace.

220
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,719
There is nothing to fear.

221
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,335
You’re pretty optimistic.

222
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,136
By the way, how is Yan Ran doing?

223
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:46,656
I’ve given her some of my powers.

224
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:47,967
She’ll be fine.

225
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,490
I haven’t left my room today.

226
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:52,206
I wonder how Min Yan is dong?

227
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,799
The poison was neutralized, but
there are residues left.

228
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,301
Elder Chu of the Shaoyang Sect

229
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,959
sent him to the Freezing Pond
in order to force out the poison.

230
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,169
I met Senior Hao Chen on my way here.

231
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,954
He told me that Xuan Ji
had skipped all her meals

232
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,865
in order to accompany Min Yan.

233
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,592
She thinks that it’s fine
since she has no feelings.

234
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:13,159
That place is extremely cold.
Her body won’t be able to take it.

235
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,302
- I’ll take a look.
- Si Feng.

236
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,484
Xuan Ji, you’ve been
here for the whole day.

237
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:27,519
Why don’t you go back and rest?

238
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,739
I’m not tired.

239
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,639
First Senior, I think you should leave.

240
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,237
I don’t think your body can take it.

241
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,358
I’ve been outside for a long time.
You mustn’t stay here anymore.

242
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,479
- Go now.
- I don’t feel cold at all.

243
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,097
Just leave now.

244
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,096
By then, I’ll tell Master
about my proposal.

245
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,667
- And you can show him this love lot.
- Proposal?

246
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:07,519
It’s just a misunderstanding.
I may not be married to you in the future.

247
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,599
You can give your love lot
to anyone else on the streets.

248
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,763
You can give it to anyone you like.
Except for me.

249
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,270
- Sixth Senior!
- Min Yan!

250
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,159
Min Yan!

251
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,078
- Sixth Senior!
- Min Yan!

252
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
Sixth Senior!

253
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,390
Min Yan, are you okay?

254
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,570
Sixth Senior!

255
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,299
Xuan Ji, keep an eye on him.

256
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,737
I’ll find Aunt Ying Hong.

257
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:46,014
Hurry!

258
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,378
Little Six!

259
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:54,744
Sixth Senior!

260
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,439
- Ling Long!
- Sixth Senior!

261
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,959
Sixth Senior!

262
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,639
Sixth Senior, are you okay?

263
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,899
Ling Long!

264
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,371
Ling Long, you can
reject the love lot I’ve drawn,

265
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:13,442
but no one will take you away from me!

266
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,839
Little Six!

267
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,674
I’m Ling Long. I’m here.

268
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,031
I’m here.

269
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,679
Little Six!

270
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,249
I’m here.

271
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,257
You... You should get better.

272
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,590
So that my father will let us get married.

273
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,001
Little Six,

274
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,150
do you feel better?

275
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,795
Please stay strong.

276
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,838
Yu Si Feng, you don’t
know when to back down.

277
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,639
You wanted to get close to Xuan Ji.

278
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,599
Don’t blame me for this.

279
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,976
Sixth Senior!

280
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,864
Sixth Senior.

281
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,869
Didn’t you say the mask
will become a smiling mask?

282
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,839
Why is it crying?

283
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,190
Si Feng, what color is this?

284
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,399
The hydrangea is blue.

285
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,286
My favorite color will be blue then.

286
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,370
This Heart Lantern is truthful.

287
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:25,950
Xuan Ji, it means that
there’s someone you love.

288
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,038
Little Six,

289
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,670
please get better so that
my father will let us get married.

290
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,174
From now on, the curse will trigger
whenever your feelings are hurt.

291
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:20,518
Even death isn’t as
painful as the curse.

292
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,976
So,

293
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,488
this is how it feels.

294
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,499
This is great!

295
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,042
I can always stay together with Si Feng!

296
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,473
Si Feng, you’re the best!

297
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,199
- Look!
- Stop fooling around.

298
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,715
Are you blushing?

299
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,512
- You’re blushing.
- I’m not.

300
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:05,077
I’m not blushing.

301
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,110
Si Feng!

302
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,983
The Loveless Curse!

303
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,728
The Loveless Curse is acting up!

304
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,331
Si Feng, are you okay?

305
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,142
You should eat more if it’s good.

306
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,429
Si Feng!

307
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,590
I’ll change your dressing for you.

308
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,687
That’s why you need to dress your wound.

309
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,638
It won’t hurt after that.

310
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:58,903
We can stay together forever.

311
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,350
Together forever with you?

312
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Si Feng!

313
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,124
Si Feng!

314
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,546
Si Feng, are you okay?

315
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,039
What should we do?

316
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,099
Those who were struck
by the Loveless Curse

317
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,770
ended their lives because
it was too painful.

318
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,110
Si Feng!

319
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,274
Xuan Ji, don’t go!

320
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,083
Si Feng!

321
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,830
Why are you so silly?

322
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,025
You did so much for her!

323
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,159
But she doesn’t care at all!

324
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,884
Stop it.

325
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,719
Stop it now.

326
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,334
Did I say anything wrong?

327
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,725
You sacrificed your life because of her!

328
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,919
It’s not Xuan Ji’s fault.

329
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,559
Si Feng, I beg you!

330
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,429
Let’s return and
plead with the palace lord.

331
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,119
You’re his favorite disciple.
He’ll surely help you out.

332
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,441
Okay?

333
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,510
- Si Feng!
- Once the Loveless Curse triggers, there’s no cure.

334
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,726
There’s no cure?

335
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,374
The Palace Lord was right.

336
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,685
She’s a calamity to your life.

337
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,430
It’s all because of Chu Xuan Ji.

338
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,311
All because of her.

339
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:57,976
She’s the reason you’re in pain!

340
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,119
I’m going to kill her.

341
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,543
I’m going to kill her!

342
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,239
How is it? Is Sixth Senior getting better?

343
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,855
The poison has been forced out.

344
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:24,790
His pulse is stable.
I think he should be fine.

345
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,228
That’s good.

346
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,349
Min Yan hasn’t eaten for a few days.

347
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,159
Get him some food from the kitchen.

348
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,243
Okay, I’ll get some soup.

349
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,972
Si Feng?

350
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,602
Si Feng!

351
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,909
Si Feng!

352
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,906
Si Feng!

353
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,263
Si Feng!

354
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,862
Si Feng!

355
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,627
Si Feng!

356
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,406
Si Feng!

357
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,763
Si Feng!

358
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,230
Si Feng, are you still unwell
because of the poison?

359
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,830
I’m fine.

360
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,545
Si Feng, I haven’t
thanked you yet

361
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:41,029
for saving Ling Long and Sixth Senior.

362
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,620
Si Feng, thank you.

363
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,893
By the way, Aunt Ying Hong wanted me
to bring some soup for Sixth Senior.

364
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:51,084
I’ll give you some later.

365
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,365
No need for that.

366
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,336
I need to rest.

367
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,013
That’s fine. Si Feng, you can rest.

368
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,564
I’ll visit you tomorrow.

369
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,265
Master, why did you stop me?

370
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,937
Silver Snake.

371
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:33,254
Do you remember what I’ve told you?

372
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:35,887
If you hurt Xuan Ji again,

373
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,999
I’ll sever our ties.

374
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,259
I...

375
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,139
I remember that.

376
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,109
So, why did you

377
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,870
still tried to harm her today?

378
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,561
- Do you admit your mistake?
- I didn’t do wrong!

379
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:53,712
Chu Xuan Ji was the one
who put you in this situation!

380
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,095
Master!

381
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,190
Master!

382
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,759
She

383
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:10,433
didn’t request me to like her.

384
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:14,675
If you want to kill
someone because

385
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,475
she didn’t give you
the answer you wanted,

386
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,633
no one will

387
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,990
love you.

388
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:27,599
You don’t have the right to love as well.

389
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,162
I’m not a person like that.

390
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:32,872
And I don’t allow my spirit beast

391
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:35,588
to do that as well.

392
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,125
But I don’t understand.

393
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,949
If she doesn’t die, you’ll die
because of her sooner or later!

394
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:47,118
So,

395
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,870
you’re saying that you must kill her?

396
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,719
Yes!

397
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,350
I’m going to kill her!

398
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,797
Fine.

399
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,190
You’re not fit to be
my spirit beast anymore.

400
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,091
Today,

401
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:09,372
I’ll sever one of my arms

402
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:12,771
and terminate my blood contract with you.

403
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,552
Master!

404
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,550
You were struck by the curse because of
her. Now, you want to disown me as well?

405
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,390
I’m not doing this because of her.

406
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,110
I’m doing this for myself.

407
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,399
Master, please don’t hurt yourself!

408
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,423
If something happens to you,
I can only pay for that with my death!

409
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,950
After the blood contract is terminated,

410
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,990
- you and I are unrelated anymore.
- No!

411
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:49,032
I don’t want you
to terminate our contract!

412
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,510
I know my fault now! I really do!

413
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,130
Master, I promise I wouldn’t
hurt Chu Xuan Ji anymore!

414
00:32:57,131 --> 00:33:00,796
Master, please don’t hurt yourself
or abandon me!

415
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:04,759
I want to stay beside you forever!

416
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,750
I want to be your guardian!

417
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,102
Fine.

418
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:13,432
Remember your promise.

419
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,537
Leave now.

420
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,697
I want to be alone for now.

421
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,657
Whenever the Loveless Curse triggers,

422
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:04,231
it will consume one Green Feather mark.

423
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,964
When all the three
Green Feather marks disappear,

424
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,719
you’ll bleed to death.

425
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,279
Master, when the
three Green Feather marks disappear

426
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,364
and a Red Feather mark
forms on your chest,

427
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,035
it’ll be too late by then.

428
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,552
Si Feng.

429
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,103
Si Feng, are you awake?

430
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,990
Si Feng, are you awake?

431
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,439
What’s the matter?

432
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,746
Si Feng, you don’t look well yesterday.

433
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,164
I’m a bit worried.

434
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:46,075
I brought you some medicine.

435
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,370
I’m fine now.

436
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:49,919
You can keep the medicine.

437
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,310
Si Feng, just let me in.

438
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:56,288
Let’s just speak in this way.

439
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,149
Si Feng, are you
unhappy these few days?

440
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,260
I feel like you’re acting weird.

441
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:08,072
When did you learn how to
observe people’s expressions?

442
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,887
I don’t know how to do that.

443
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:17,933
I don’t know about others, but
I know it when you’re unhappy.

444
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,306
Si Feng.

445
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,749
Si Feng.

446
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,133
You’re overthinking.

447
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:33,544
I’m not unhappy.

448
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:35,943
But I have something to tell you.

449
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,158
Now that Ling Long and Min Yan are safe,

450
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:42,118
it’s time for me to return to Lize Palace.

451
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,829
Si Feng, are you going to leave?

452
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:52,045
Of course.

453
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,392
That’s where I belong.

454
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,750
But you’ll be punished if you return.

455
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,100
You don’t need to worry about that.

456
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:03,679
How could I not worry?

457
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,868
And you said that we’re going
to be together forever.

458
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:10,789
Why are you leaving now?

459
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,780
I...

460
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:15,924
Si Feng, I don’t want you to go.

461
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,557
Don’t try to stop me or persuade me.

462
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:28,423
I’ve decided.

463
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,300
There’s no reason for me to stay.

464
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:39,439
Si Feng, are you leaving because
you’re unhappy that I avoided you?

465
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,370
I’ve thought about it.
Si Feng, I can give you anything you want.

466
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:44,761
I can give you my true heart as well.

467
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,348
If you don’t believe me...

468
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,279
Chu Xuan Ji, who
do you think I am?

469
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,110
I... I just want to make you
happy. I’m willing to do anything.

470
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,650
So, Si Feng, please
don’t leave, okay?

471
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,030
You’re willing to do anything?

472
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,790
Si Feng, what are you doing?

473
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,999
Are you willing to do this as well?

474
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,799
You said you wanted to marry me
without any careful considerations.

475
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,172
Do you know

476
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:58,721
what I’m going to do next?

477
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,579
Si Feng,

478
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:03,684
you didn’t mention that
you were going to do this.

479
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,473
Si Feng,

480
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,030
should I kiss you
during moments like these?

481
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,727
Chu Xuan Ji, that’s enough!

482
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:37,534
You’re still distracted in this situation.

483
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,482
Si Feng!

484
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,719
- I...
- Xuan Ji, you’re here as well?

485
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,079
I’m here to change the flowers
in Si Feng’s room.

486
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,839
These Snow Flowers were freshly picked.

487
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,919
They look the best when
you put them in a room.

488
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,634
Thank you.

489
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:51,919
Why are you thanking me?

490
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,319
Most of my fellow female disciples

491
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,790
are jealous that I get to change
flowers for Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace.

492
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,060
Chu Xuan Ji, return now.

493
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,171
- Si Feng...
- Return now.

494
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,494
No, she...

495
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:11,885
I...

496
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,959
Ling Long, do you know?
Si Feng is too much!

497
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,998
He chased me out and
kept Yu Ning is his room.

498
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,866
You know, in my heart, I feel

499
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,766
a hint of anger.

500
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,239
Yes. I feel angry.

501
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,390
It’s the feeling that
you’ve described it before.

502
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,599
But why am I angry?

503
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,942
Ling Long, please wake up.

504
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,599
Please tell me the reason why.

505
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,350
What should I do in order
to make Si Feng stay?

506
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,875
Ling Long.

507
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:07,079
Ling Long?

508
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,450
Ling Long, you’re awake?

509
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,752
Ling Long!

510
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,855
Ling Long!

511
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,721
Ling Long, can you hear me?

512
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,103
Ling Long!

513
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,908
Ling Long!

514
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,799
Ling Long, say something!
You’re scaring me!

515
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,126
Ling Long!

516
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,159
Si Feng, you’re leaving? Why don’t you
stay here for a couple more days?

517
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,119
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji?

518
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,839
- Si Feng!
- What’s wrong?

519
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,439
Si Feng!

520
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,874
I think something’s wrong with Ling Long.

521
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,201
Her primordial spirit has been removed.

522
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:51,881
Only her soul is left.

523
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:53,789
That’s why she’s in that state.

524
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:57,798
Is she in any danger?

525
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,870
Her soul is still intact.
She’s safe for now.

526
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,456
But if her primordial spirit

527
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:06,007
doesn’t return to her body within a month,

528
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,678
Ling Long will not
be able to take it.

529
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,722
Wu Tong.

530
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:16,359
I’m sure Wu Tong is behind this.

531
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,973
Where are you going?

532
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:20,890
I’ll find Wu Tong and retrieve
Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

533
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,119
- Second Senior is with him as well!
- Xuan Ji, don’t be reckless.

534
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,755
You don’t even know where Wu Tong is.
How are you going to find him?

535
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:28,999
I’ll search in
Mount Gao and Xuanyuan Sect.

536
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,239
I’ll search for places with demons around.

537
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,911
As long as I can find one demon,
I’m sure I’ll be able to find Wu Tong.

538
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:36,421
Sky Hall wants us to
panic and act recklessly.

539
00:42:36,422 --> 00:42:38,036
You mustn’t act recklessly now.

540
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:41,951
We should formulate a complete
plan before we save Ling Long.

541
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:43,567
A complete plan?

542
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:46,642
You said so yourselves.
Sky Hall is plotting against us!

543
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:48,911
How could we formulate
a complete plan against them?

544
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:51,702
Xuan Ji, you’re
not allowed to go!

545
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:57,810
Wu Tong didn’t kill Ling Long.

546
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:00,050
He removed her primordial spirit.

547
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,081
That means he has ulterior motives.

548
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,287
No one is to leave the island
before we figure out what’s going on.

549
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:10,078
If you leave Fuyu Island,

550
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,997
- I will sever my ties with you!
- Father!

551
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,896
Why is Ling Long clenching her fist?

552
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:26,822
She’s been clenching her fist
since she came back.

553
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,682
<i>Spirit key in exchange
for primordial spirit.</i>

554
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,183
Spirit key

555
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,958
in exchange for primordial spirit.

556
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,607
They want the spirit key.

557
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,078
Despicable!

558
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:53,657
What a ruthless act!

559
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,291
He’s holding my daughter as his hostage.

560
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,336
If I don’t give him the spirit key,

561
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:04,008
Ling Long will have no hope.

562
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,390
But if I do give him the spirit key,

563
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:12,496
I’ll let down the world.

564
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,414
I know what you’re thinking.

565
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:39,165
But forcing your way through
isn’t a good idea.

566
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,490
It’s fine if they want something else.

567
00:44:44,655 --> 00:44:46,799
But they want the spirit key.

568
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,999
Even if Father agrees, the other
sect leaders won’t agree to it.

569
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,319
What should we do
if we can’t solve this dilemma?

570
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,354
There’s no time left for Ling Long.
She only has one month.

571
00:44:57,355 --> 00:45:00,032
Now that the Five Great Sects
are on Fuyu Island,

572
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,792
they will definitely think of something.

573
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:05,003
Even if the other sect leaders
disagree, you still have your father,

574
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:09,030
your fellow disciples in
Shaoyang Sect, Min Yan, and I.

575
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,199
Don’t worry.

576
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,840
You’re not alone.

577
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,622
Everyone will try to help.

578
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,950
Si Feng, you said I still have you?
Does that mean you’re staying?

579
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,213
Ling Long is in a terrible situation now.

580
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:25,844
How could I just leave?

581
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,884
Si Feng, you’re the best.

582
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:31,235
I feel relieved whenever you’re with me.
