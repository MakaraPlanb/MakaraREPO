00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,278
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,790
<i>EPISODE 30</i>

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,061
Brother Tong!

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,230
If you hurt Min Yan,

5
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:45,204
I'll kill your beloved flower demon.

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,710
She's just a flower demon.
You can take her life.

7
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,613
If I can create one Ling Long,

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,198
I can create many copies of her.

9
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,360
Brother Tong, save me!

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,399
Sixth Senior!

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,510
This is bad!
Our Birth Candles were used up!

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,839
You know how to enter
this place by using that item?

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,663
You are quite capable as well.

14
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:22,519
It's a pity that you
don't have much time.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,985
Now, half of your soul is in Mount Buzhou

16
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,533
while half of it is in the human realm.

17
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,810
Let me see how much power you have left.

18
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,036
Take them down!

19
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:06,007
This demon actually has a malignant aura?

20
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,734
It has tremendous power.

21
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,325
It isn't an ordinary demon.

22
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,439
He's aiming for Xuan Ji,

23
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,896
but he didn't extinguish
Xuan Ji's Birth Candle.

24
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,567
What is he plotting?

25
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,857
Stop!

26
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,512
Let's stop fighting.

27
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,094
I admit my defeat.

28
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,375
Sixth Senior?

29
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:34,748
We don't have much time.

30
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,426
I want to exchange conditions with you.

31
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,534
Sky Hall wants the spirit keys, right?

32
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:41,019
As long as you're willing to
give me Ling Long's primordial spirit,

33
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,746
I'm willing to betray the Five Great Sects

34
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,897
and become your subordinate in Sky Hall.

35
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,723
I'll help you obtain all the spirit keys.

36
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:49,359
No! Sixth Senior, you mustn't do that!

37
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Ling Long wouldn't want you to do this!

38
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,551
What else can we do?

39
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:54,811
She can't afford to wait any longer.

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,139
Wu Tong, you're just angry over
what had happened in the past.

41
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,839
I'll stay here, and you can do
whatever you want.

42
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,209
If you want me to be your dog,

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,213
I will.

44
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:15,999
Ling Long, this
man really loves you.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,519
He loves me that much
even though this is our first meeting.

46
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,533
Why don't you dig out his heart
to see if he's sincere or not?

47
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,844
That's a great idea.

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,966
I'll make you pay for
your threats in the past.

49
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,137
Stop!

50
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,457
Brother Wu Tong?

51
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,952
Seems like he's sincere.

52
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:05,816
Why don't we let him stay
and let him witness our love?

53
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,106
Isn't that more interesting?

54
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,718
I'll do anything for you
as long as you return

55
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,989
Ling Long's primordial spirit to us.

56
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,359
Just you wish.

57
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,329
You want her primordial spirit? Fine.

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,080
Exchange it with another life.

59
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,350
Someone!

60
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,832
Second Senior!

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,572
Wu Tong, you scum!
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

62
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:38,319
Kill me if you dare!

63
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,750
Fine. I'll grant you your wish.

64
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,429
Zhong Min Yan, if you want to
retrieve Ling Long's primordial spirit,

65
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,380
you need to show some sincerity.

66
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,046
Kill him in front of me.

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,910
Sixth Senior, you mustn't do so.

68
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,390
If you can't kill him,

69
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:05,245
you won't be able to
retrieve Ling Long's primordial spirit.

70
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,999
Zhong Min Yan, I'm an impatient man.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,799
Min Yan, it's a trap.

72
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,079
Don't believe him.

73
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,230
You mustn't do so.

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,270
I will surely save Ling Long
and Second Senior.

75
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,619
Do you think you can return?

76
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,410
Look at how much time you have left.

77
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,807
Zhong Min Yan, this is
the Black and White Ring.

78
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,991
It's made from Xuanyin Steel
and Mingyang Stone.

79
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:40,601
We need to wear this in order
to stay in Mount Buzhou.

80
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:44,719
Will you be my dog in exchange
for Chu Ling Long's primordial spirit?

81
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,204
Or will you let both Chu Ling Long
and your Second Senior die together?

82
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,515
You make the choice.

83
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,510
- I'll stay.
- Sixth Senior!

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,193
Second Senior,

85
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,679
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,034
I can't save anyone

87
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,110
if I don't do this.

88
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,190
No.

89
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,818
No!

90
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,955
Second Senior!

91
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,110
Second Senior!

92
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:05,463
You want me to kill my senior?

93
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,337
I can't bear to do so.

94
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,404
But I had cut off one of his arm.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,255
That's enough, right?

96
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,639
I've hurt my senior.

97
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,430
I can't turn back now.

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,573
You believe in me now, right?

99
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,970
Fine.

100
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,321
I see your sincerity.

101
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,310
Here's Ling Long's primordial spirit.

102
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,503
Xuan Ji!

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,236
Second Senior!

104
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,399
The Birth Candles are dying out.
We should return soon.

105
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,699
What's going on?

106
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,700
Brother Wu Tong!

107
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
So, their Birth Candles were
bound by the Binding Formation.

108
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,993
Their Birth Candles had extinguished.

109
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,447
And they can't enter or leave the place.

110
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,663
They will perish in Mount Buzhou.

111
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,361
If Xuan Ji dies there, it means
she will fail her tribulation.

112
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,192
I mustn't let her die in Mount Buzhou.

113
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,119
God of War, you're powerful indeed.

114
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,279
It's a pity that you can't
use your powers here.

115
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,750
You won't be able to escape
no matter how hard you fight.

116
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,736
What did you do?

117
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,127
I didn't do anything.

118
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,559
Someone else didn't want
you to escape.

119
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,296
He has cut off your means of escape.

120
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,079
The Birth Candles have been extinguished.

121
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,095
Mortals can't last long in Mount Buzhou.

122
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:12,669
You can only stay here
until you perish.

123
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,527
Zhong Min Yan is smart.

124
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,238
He made the right decision.

125
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,808
No.

126
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,311
I mustn't die here.

127
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,065
I'm willing to surrender as well.

128
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,279
- Ruo Yu!
- Ruo Yu.

129
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,599
Don't try to persuade me.

130
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:35,635
I've lost my mask.

131
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:38,026
If I return to Lize Palace,
I will face death.

132
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,439
Staying here is a better option.

133
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,070
At least I can still survive.

134
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,439
This is pretty interesting.

135
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,325
You want to stay? Fine.

136
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,705
You need to follow his steps.

137
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,896
Show us your sincerity.

138
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,986
Kill them and
retrieve the primordial spirit.

139
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,011
Ruo Yu, don't fall for it!

140
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,616
They wanted us to kill each other!

141
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:02,199
You are on the verge of death.

142
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,430
You should play your last act
for me before you die.

143
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,540
Every man for himself.

144
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,990
Don't blame me for this.

145
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,939
Ruo Yu.

146
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,879
Si Feng!

147
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,165
Si Feng!

148
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,627
Si Feng!

149
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,746
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji.

150
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,359
Si Feng!

151
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,830
Si Feng! Don't scare me!

152
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,639
Si Feng! You'll be fine!

153
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,282
Si Feng!

154
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,799
We'll definitely escape!

155
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,016
Si Feng!

156
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:56,964
Si Feng!

157
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,359
Si Feng!

158
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,488
I will kill everyone
who dares to hurt you!

159
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,181
Si Feng!

160
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,454
Si Feng!

161
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,147
Si Feng!

162
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,123
Si Feng!

163
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,795
Si Feng!

164
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,159
Si Feng!

165
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,394
Si Feng! Wake up! Look at me!

166
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:05,839
Si Feng!

167
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,879
Si Feng! This can't be!

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,783
Si Feng! We're home now!

169
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:12,030
Si Feng! We're out!

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,590
- Don't cry.
- Si Feng!

171
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,834
Si Feng! No!

172
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,830
I'm here!

173
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:29,907
No!

174
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,910
Si Feng!

175
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:39,946
No!

176
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,436
Si Feng! Please don't scare me!

177
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,129
Si Feng!

178
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,470
Si Feng!

179
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,190
Si Feng!

180
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,999
Si Feng!

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,493
Si Feng! Please don't scare me!

182
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:14,767
Si Feng!

183
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,990
Si Feng!

184
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,830
Si Feng!

185
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,990
Si Feng!

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,030
No!

187
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,670
Look at me! Please don't scare me!

188
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,079
Senior Hao Chen? Please save Si Feng!

189
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,239
Senior, please save him!

190
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,190
Senior!

191
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:53,978
I beg you!

192
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,379
Xuan Ji, what exactly happened?

193
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,330
Where's Min Yan and the rest?

194
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,510
Father.

195
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,559
Si Feng!

196
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,639
Si Feng!

197
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,239
Si Feng!

198
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,070
Aunt Ying Hong, how's Si Feng?

199
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,208
How is he?

200
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,100
The person who struck him
wanted him to die.

201
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,686
The sword pierced his heart.

202
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:39,239
Ordinary people would've been dead.

203
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,479
Si Feng survived due to
his many years of training.

204
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,518
But he's just a human.

205
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,589
His heart was pierced.
It'll be hard for him to survive.

206
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,136
Now, the qi in his body is dissipating.

207
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,559
We can't stop that.

208
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,479
I'm afraid that he can't last for long.

209
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,790
Si Feng, this can't be.

210
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,359
Si Feng, this is not real.

211
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,981
- This can't be!
- Don't touch him!

212
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,847
You were the reason behind this!

213
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,545
Si Feng would never take the risk

214
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:06,239
in Mount Buzhou if it weren't for you!

215
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,838
He would've never been injured
if he didn't block the attack for you!

216
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,239
If you can't save him, I'll
bring him back to Lize Palace.

217
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,620
- Si Feng!
- No!

218
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,588
He mustn't move in this condition.

219
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,768
Si Feng!

220
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,903
What should we do?

221
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:23,493
Don't tell me I can only
watch him suffer like this?

222
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,478
What if I reverse my Yang Jue
Skill and use it to protect his heart?

223
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,279
Will he be saved if I do so?

224
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,759
You mustn't!

225
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,600
You can activate the Nine Cycles Spell

226
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:37,239
by using the Heartless Tactics
in conjunction with Yang Jue Skill.

227
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,314
But it is very risky.

228
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:42,879
If anything goes wrong, your
blood would flow in reverse.

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,113
Not only will you not be able
to save him, you'll die as well.

230
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,666
What do you mean?

231
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,319
Si Feng is in this condition
because of Chu Xuan Ji!

232
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,790
Why aren't you letting her do so
when she has a way to save him?

233
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,639
Xuan Ji, our fate
is predetermined.

234
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,866
- You mustn't force it.
- I will force it!

235
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,879
I will save him! Even when
the possibility is close to nothing!

236
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,959
It's the best if I can save him,

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,590
but if I can't save him,
I'll die together with him.

238
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,079
Xuan Ji, stop messing around!

239
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,306
Don't stop me!

240
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,599
I'll do it.

241
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,028
I'll use the Nine Cycles Spell
to save Si Feng.

242
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,599
Hao Chen, you...

243
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,839
I'm better in Heartless Tactics
and Yang Jue Skill compared with her.

244
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,190
It's more stable if I do that.

245
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,590
Senior Hao Chen,
you don't need to do this.

246
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,919
You don't want me to save him?

247
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,390
Are you asking me to witness your death?

248
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,342
Yu Si Feng,

249
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,670
it's fine if you die.

250
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,641
But you've caught Xuan Ji
in your love web.

251
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,239
If anything happens to you

252
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,070
and Xuan Ji harbors anguish
because of this,

253
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,962
even a million deaths are not enough
for you to atone for it.

254
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,858
Today, I may save you,

255
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:16,590
but next time, I'll show
you my true colors.

256
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,066
Senior Hao Chen, how's Si Feng?

257
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,919
You've sustained internal injury.

258
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,279
Why didn't you tell us
before you did that?

259
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,249
Senior Hao Chen, when did you get hurt?

260
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,757
While I was searching for you,
I saw a suspicious demon at the altar.

261
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:42,959
And I was struck by his malignant aura.

262
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,465
But it's fine. I know my own condition.

263
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:50,758
Xuan Ji, Hao Chen was hurt
because of your reckless actions.

264
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,164
- Sorry, Senior. I...
- I said it's fine.

265
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:56,441
You don't need to worry.

266
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,310
It's just that the attributes of

267
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,430
Lize Palace and Shaoyang Sect
are different.

268
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:06,940
The Yang Jue qi that I've sent to
him can only stay inside his heart.

269
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,999
It can't travel through his entire body.

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,039
I can only continue this
when his body accepts it on its own.

271
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,852
Wait? We still need to wait?

272
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:15,649
How long can Si Feng last?

273
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,240
Will this method work or not?

274
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,877
Xuan Ji, if my qi can't
travel through his entire body,

275
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:23,508
you better be prepared.

276
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,509
If a strong spirit energy
is protecting his heart,

277
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,441
we may be able to force the qi
to travel through his body.

278
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,825
There are Pagoda Trees at the base
of this mountain.

279
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:34,848
If we can find a 10,000-year-old
Pagoda Tree

280
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,639
and create medicine out of its roots,

281
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
Si Feng will be fine after he consumes it.

282
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,952
Yes. Xuan Ji, take
care of Hero Yu.

283
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:45,848
You need to transfer your qi
to protect his heart every five minutes.

284
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,359
I'll follow you.

285
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,239
Hao Chen, you need to recuperate.

286
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,359
You mustn't hurt your own vitality
because of this.

287
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,997
I won't be able to give an explanation

288
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,948
to Senior Heng Yang
if anything happens to you.

289
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,879
Xuan Ji, take good care of your senior.

290
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,070
Let's go.

291
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,122
I'll go as well!

292
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,950
Yu Si Feng isn't that great.

293
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,510
He's not worth sacrificing your life for.

294
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,121
Xuan Ji, I told you before.

295
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,519
You don't know much about relationships.

296
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,510
How could you entrust your future
to a stranger like him?

297
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,361
Senior, I may not know
much, but I know enough.

298
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:34,774
Si Feng is the person I
want to spend my life with.

299
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,750
If he leaves me behind,
I would rather die.

300
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,270
You're trapped by your relationship.

301
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,753
No class at all.

302
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,264
This is the most despicable

303
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,318
and ignorant act.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,399
Si Feng is the person I
want to spend my life with.

305
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,938
So stupid!

306
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,839
It's no wonder you fail
your tribulations every time.

307
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,390
If I don't help you,

308
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:24,582
this will continue forever.

309
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:34,750
Si Feng, please hang
in there. I beg you.

310
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,001
The medicine is here!

311
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:42,072
Chu Xuan Ji, help him up!

312
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,435
We didn't find any
10,000-year-old Pagoda Tree.

313
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,266
We'll see what a 1,000-year-old
Pagoda Tree can do.

314
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,150
How is it? Is it working?

315
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,694
No.

316
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:11,112
The spirit energy is weaker
than Senior Hao Chen's qi.

317
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,199
We can't protect his heart this way.

318
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,082
No. I must find it.

319
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,213
Even if there's no
10,000-year-old Pagoda Tree,

320
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,644
I'll find a 10,000-year-old
immortal fruit or something.

321
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,986
Si Feng.

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,350
Si Feng, hang in there.

323
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,719
What if they can't find anything useful?

324
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,501
What should I do then?
Should I submit to fate?

325
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,750
No, I don't want that.

326
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,839
Si Feng, you will overcome this.

327
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,927
Si Feng, I believe you can overcome this.

328
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,445
Please get better soon.

329
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,870
I didn't expect my Love Flower
to have so much spirit energy.

330
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:00,045
Maybe it can save Si Feng.

331
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,959
Its spirit power has protected your heart.

332
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,839
Si Feng, you must hang in there.

333
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,270
You must get better soon.

334
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,776
My king, according to my observation,

335
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:25,954
there are spirit energy from
the heavens surrounding Chu Xuan Ji.

336
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,444
I wonder what happened?

337
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:30,395
It's because Xuan Ji used the Love Flower
to save Yu Si Feng.

338
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,710
Yu Si Feng wasn't supposed to live.

339
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,159
I gave the Love Flower to Xuan Ji
in order to get rid of her anguish.

340
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,313
But she actually used it
to save an outsider.

341
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:41,696
Doesn't she understand
the purpose of Love Flower?

342
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:45,639
She doesn't understand indeed.

343
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,679
My king, are you angry because
she used an immortal item?

344
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,470
Or are you angry because she used
the Love Flower you gave her?

345
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,830
What a load of nonsense.

346
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,041
Are you still trying to joke around?

347
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,620
The Love Flower I gave her?

348
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,650
I'm just angry because she's stupid,
and she doesn't know what's good for her.

349
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:08,201
That's why Yu Si Feng is able to
lead her by the nose.

350
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,210
But Chu Xuan Ji has
recovered her six senses.

351
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,159
And she fancies another person.

352
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,154
My king, if you let her
continue her peaceful life,

353
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:21,665
there's a huge possibility that

354
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,030
she may be able to
return to the heavens.

355
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,870
Are you asking me to let them be together?

356
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,955
No! I mean, that
isn't suitable at all.

357
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,820
But my king, mortals
have a short lifespan.

358
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:45,069
Even if she is to be together
with Yu Si Feng in this life,

359
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,319
it will only be temporary.

360
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,359
When she returns to the heavens,

361
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,159
she'll understand that
life is but a dream.

362
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,352
By then, she can stay by your side

363
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,559
and continue her relationship with you.

364
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,195
How dare you say that!

365
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,519
You want me to let Xuan Ji
and an outsider to decide her fate?

366
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,884
Impossible!

367
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,599
She belonged to me in the past.

368
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,719
And she'll only belong
to me and the heavens

369
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,312
no matter if it's the present or future!

370
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,519
Since I've come down to guide her,

371
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,190
I will make sure nothing will be changed!

372
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,451
Xuan Ji has disobeyed me many times
because of this Yu Si Feng.

373
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,321
I mustn't let him stay by her side.

374
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,475
I need to sever

375
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,172
this ill-fated relationship for her!

376
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,106
Father.

377
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,030
This is Ling Long's primordial spirit.

378
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,343
We managed to save her.

379
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,782
Where's Min Yan?

380
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:20,170
Sixth Senior?

381
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,081
He...

382
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:25,559
Sixth Senior was left behind
in Mount Buzhou.

383
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,239
And he became Wu Tong's subordinate.

384
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,319
Father, did you give Sixth
Senior a secret mission?

385
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,835
He... He severed
Second Senior's arm

386
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:37,159
and he wants me to tell you that
he'll accomplish his missions.

387
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,159
What? What do you mean by that?

388
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,510
I didn't say anything like that to him!
Why is he...

389
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,390
Why did he do that then?

390
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,060
Xuan Ji, don't
you believe in me?

391
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,119
It's not that.

392
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,110
It's just that, he...

393
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,728
He...

394
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,196
Maybe Min Yan was used
by Wu Tong and the demons.

395
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,519
That's why he betrayed our sect.

396
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,073
Or maybe

397
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:22,553
that demon who brought you there
was the traitor.

398
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:26,639
The demon worked together with Sky Hall
to deceive you.

399
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,318
Impossible. Purple Fox
died in Mount Buzhou.

400
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,260
It's impossible for her to deceive us.

401
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,030
What about the disciple of Lize Palace
who entered Mount Buzhou with you?

402
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,888
What about him?

403
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:43,689
Ruo Yu?

404
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,371
Si Feng!

405
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,947
It's him.

406
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,670
He was the one who hurt Si Feng.

407
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,552
He was the one who hurt Si Feng!

408
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,599
I told you before.

409
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,515
I told you not to act recklessly.

410
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:14,759
But you won't listen.

411
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,877
Mount Buzhou is a place
unknown to mortals.

412
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:21,599
But you insisted on going there.

413
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,290
In the end, everything
has become a mess.

414
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,903
It's fine.

415
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,270
It's a lesson for you all.

416
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,112
Now, you know you should
think twice before you act.

417
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,292
As for Si Feng,

418
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,570
you don't need to worry about him.

419
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,670
Hao Chen has never boasted his abilities.

420
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,361
He won't do things
that he's not confident in.

421
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,736
Do you know that

422
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,679
your Senior Hao Chen only risked himself

423
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,350
to help an outsider because of your sake?

424
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,919
Hao Chen is passionate towards you.

425
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,567
And you two were a perfect couple.

426
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:14,078
But you insist on...

427
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,076
Father, Si Feng and
I love each other.

428
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,321
And we promised to never leave each other.

429
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:25,710
So, I will never marry
anyone except for Si Feng.

430
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,274
I've told Senior Hao Chen
about my feelings.

431
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:32,185
Father, I hope you can
understand me as well.

432
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,018
Fine.

433
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,967
Get up now.

434
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,534
I know that

435
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,090
Yu Si Feng is your benefactor.

436
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,710
We'll talk about this in the future.

437
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:02,675
I need to patrol the area

438
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,159
and set up the Thousand Bells Formation
in order to detect demons.

439
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,990
By doing so, the demons

440
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,222
won't be able to create trouble.

441
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,790
Si Feng, how do you feel?

442
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,734
Si Feng.

443
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,710
Does it hurt?

444
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,190
Si Feng!

445
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,670
Si Feng!

446
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,830
Si Feng!

447
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,777
The mortal's method doesn't work indeed.

448
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:59,550
It will only cause him harm
as the spirit energy is too strong.

449
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,540
Si Feng, I'll undo two of your seals
below your ribcage.

450
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,939
If not, you will die.

451
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,693
Silver Snake, no!

452
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,079
Si Feng!

453
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,639
Are you afraid that Xuan Ji
will know that you're a demon

454
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,239
after I unseal them?

455
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,106
But if I don't unseal them,
your blood won't flow.

456
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:25,297
And they won't be able to save you
no matter what they do.

457
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,399
Don't worry.

458
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,399
The spirit energy inside your heart
is very powerful.

459
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,710
It will suppress your demonic nature.

460
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,479
Listen to me, okay?

461
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,753
Please listen to me!

462
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,990
Si Feng!

463
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,309
Si Feng, how do you feel?

464
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,460
Do you feel better?

465
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,863
Si Feng! Why is this happening?

466
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:08,174
Why couldn't it suppress your power?

467
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,710
The thing that Xuan Ji gave me

468
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,150
clashes with the spirit energy

469
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,440
within my body.

470
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,389
Why is this happening?

471
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,990
Si Feng, you mustn't force yourself!

472
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,144
Oh right, Palace Lord once told me that

473
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,869
I need to undo your Dragon Crystal Seal
when you're in danger.

474
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,439
And let you consume human.

475
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,768
Si Feng, I'll bring
you some humans.

476
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,319
Wait for me!

477
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,799
Silver Snake!

478
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,031
Come back!

479
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,678
Si Feng, don't overexert yourself!

480
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,882
I know you don't want to
do this, but I have no choice.

481
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,274
Si Feng!

482
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,905
Give me the Dragon Crystals.

483
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:59,109
I won't give them to you!

484
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,620
Your life will be in danger!

485
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,252
Go and find him.

486
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,930
Find Brother Liu.

487
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,550
Hurry and find Brother Liu!

488
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,445
Si Feng.

489
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,740
Aunt Ying Hong, I'll bring
this medicine to Si Feng.

490
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,411
Be careful. It's hot.

491
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,630
Why is the door sealed with a spell?

492
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,839
Si Feng?

493
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,616
Si Feng!

494
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,423
Si Feng, are you awake?

495
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:07,712
Si Feng!

496
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,291
Si Feng!

497
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,303
Si Feng!

498
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,718
Si Feng! Talk to me!

499
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,414
Si Feng! Open the door!

500
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,651
Si Feng!

501
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,039
Si Feng!

502
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,315
Si Feng!

503
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Si Feng!

504
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,783
I smell demon!
Why is there a demon here?

505
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,372
Si Feng!

506
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,631
Father!

507
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:03,919
A demon has captured Si Feng!

508
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,281
I caught its scent!
It's heading toward the forest! //

509
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:07,441
Let's go!

510
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,966
Where's the demon?

511
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,270
Xuan Ji, do you know where it is?

512
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,830
It has a faint scent.
It's hard for me to locate it.

513
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,069
Let's split up and search.

514
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,540
Okay. Let's split up.

515
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,590
Yu Si Feng, why are you here?

516
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,348
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji, did you have a clear look of that demon?

517
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,492
No.

518
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,817
This is strange.

519
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,559
Why didn't the demon kill Yu Si Feng?

520
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,179
Why did the demon escape
after it brought Yu Si Feng here?

521
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,674
Senior Hao Chen, that's enough.

522
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:25,099
Let's take Si Feng back.

523
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,319
Fine. I need to cast Nine Cycles
Spell to stabilize his pulse for now.

524
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,590
Let's go.

525
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,418
That demon is acting strangely.

526
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:37,493
Yu Si Feng had received
spirit energy from the heavens.

527
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:40,958
He should be fine, yet
he's extremely weak.

528
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,309
What exactly is going on?

529
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:47,079
By casting the Nine Cycles
Spell, I can travel around his body

530
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,498
and understand what's going on.

531
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,479
Strange.

532
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,115
There's nothing wrong with his body.

533
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:56,586
He's like an ordinary human.

534
00:38:57,862 --> 00:39:00,990
Wait, something
is hidden within.

535
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,621
Demon Poison?

536
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,119
Senior!

537
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,510
Xuan Ji, don't come near me!

538
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,552
Be careful!

539
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,660
It's Demon Poison!

540
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,278
The poison is affecting Hao Chen!

541
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,805
I'm afraid his body will be taken over!

542
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,046
What should we do? He's casting
the Nine Cycles Spell!

543
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,359
If we force him to stop now,
the poison will enter his body!

544
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,597
Let me try!

545
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,161
No! The poison is too strong!

546
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,626
Ting Nu? Brother Liu?

547
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:49,590
Ting Nu, please save Si Feng!

548
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,590
I can neutralize the poison.

549
00:39:55,149 --> 00:39:56,594
Wait!

550
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,239
Demon! How dare you come here!

551
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,373
Father, although Ting Nu is a
merman, he had helped us many times.

552
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:04,519
He was once an immortal medic.
His medical skills are superb.

553
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,879
- He's our friend.
- Nonsense!

554
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,430
We're cultivators! How could we
work together with demons?

555
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,030
Old guy, you're stubborn indeed!

556
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,236
What's wrong with demons?

557
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:18,319
Many kind-hearted demons
are much better than evil humans!

558
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,679
This is an emergency, you know?

559
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,480
It'll be too late if you don't
allow my friend to help.

560
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,238
Father, please let Ting Nu save them!

561
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,919
They can't hold out for long!
Ting Nu, please save them!

562
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,546
Sect Leader, this is an emergency.

563
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:33,959
Why don't we let him try?

564
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,110
Besides, he won't be able to
do much with us around.

565
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,768
The poison has been neutralized.

566
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,364
Si Feng!

567
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,556
Si Feng!

568
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,279
Wait, it's him?

569
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,481
Strange, I tremble with fear
when I look at him.

570
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:33,469
But I have never seen him before.

571
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,134
Your injury isn't serious.

572
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:38,268
But there are residues of the poison
inside your body.

573
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,719
You better go on a retreat
and recuperate for a few months.

574
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,955
No!

575
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:44,879
I haven't captured that demon yet.

576
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,354
Senior, I'm afraid the demon
won't return anymore.

577
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,559
You need to recuperate.
Demon Poison is a big deal.

578
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,597
He Yang, bring Hao Chen back to Shaoyang
for his recuperation.

579
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:55,559
- We'll take it from here.
- Okay, come.

580
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,956
Si Feng.

581
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,254
Si Feng!

582
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,595
Ting Nu, what's wrong with Si Feng?

583
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,399
Si Feng's condition is complicated.
Yi Huan, I need your assistance.

584
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,839
Xuan Ji, you can wait outside
with the rest.

585
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,253
- I...
- Don't worry.

586
00:42:16,254 --> 00:42:19,134
I'll do my best to treat Si Feng.

587
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,424
I...

588
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,653
Si Feng, I'm going to
reconstruct your heart.

589
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,359
I need you to stay awake.

590
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,630
And bear with the pain.

591
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,383
Thank you.

592
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,812
It's done.

593
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,999
Little Phoenix, you managed
to survive this ordeal.

594
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,439
But there are many ordeals
waiting for you in the future.

595
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,950
You better don't injure yourself anymore.

596
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,999
Okay. I'll seal his Demon Point right now.

597
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,620
Yi Huan.

598
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,447
We should use
the Dragon Crystal Seal on him

599
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,108
when he is fully recovered.

600
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,236
Fine.
