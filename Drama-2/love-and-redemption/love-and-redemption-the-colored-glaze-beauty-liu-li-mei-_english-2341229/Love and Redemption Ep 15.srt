00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,272
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,720
<i>EPISODE 15</i>

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,799
Let me see your Destiny Pearl.

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,639
Don’t try to have any ideas about it.

5
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,133
I know something’s inside it.

6
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:02,599
The spirit key of Xuanyuan
Sect is hidden in that pearl.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,240
I’ve been looking it for a long time.
Just give it to me.

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,749
The spirit key is very important.
We can’t let a demon like you hold it.

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,157
I’m different from the demons in Sky Hall.

10
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:15,318
I’m just trying to save Wu Zhi Qi
with the spirit key.

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,381
I can give you the spirit key,
but only on one condition.

12
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,559
What condition?

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,719
You’re the only person who knows
how to cast spell in Mount Gao.

14
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,140
I’m sure the others have no idea
about the Mirror of Origin.

15
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,021
I think the mirror shard is in your hand.

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,800
You can use the mirror shard
to exchange for your spirit key.

17
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,159
Mirror of Origin?

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,783
I’ve never heard of it.

19
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,196
Mount Gao is a huge place.

20
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,319
You can look for
the mirror shard yourself.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,102
- I don’t know anything.
- You’re lying.

22
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,632
I saw it.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,952
- Xuan Ji!
- Ling Long!

24
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,987
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,590
Why did you come up here?
It’s dangerous, you know?

26
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:02,999
Didn’t I ask you to wait for us
down below?

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,893
Someone would’ve become

28
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,560
the wife of a bandit chief
if I didn’t come and rescue her.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,084
By the way, you said you didn’t know
about the Mirror of Origin, right?

30
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,405
How do you explain the mirror
inside your Maze Formation?

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,439
Dumb girl! Keep quiet!

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,439
So what if that’s the mirror shard?

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,455
I’ll take both the spirit
keys and the mirror shard.

34
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,944
You!

35
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,043
Sky Hall?

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,120
Are they all dead?

37
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,918
They...

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,548
You demons! You will pay for this!

39
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,025
Kill them!

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,799
Weren’t you amazing just now?

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,434
Burn them with your Samadhi Fire then!

42
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:54,039
I... I can’t use it right now.

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,760
So, you’re just an amateur.

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,160
I can see colours now.

45
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,279
- Wu Tong?
- What a busy scene.

46
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,199
- Long time no see.
- Wu Tong?

47
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,399
All the people I’m looking for
are actually here?

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,676
Wu Tong, why are you here?

49
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,319
What?

50
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,159
You didn’t expect me to be alive, right?

51
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Sorry to disappoint you.

52
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,835
I’m quite tough.

53
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:40,999
I told you before.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,879
I’ll drill a hole in you
if I see you again.

55
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,160
There’s more than one hole in my body.

56
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,859
Come on.

57
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,799
My arms are always open for you.

58
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,039
Wu Tong, it’s been a long time.

59
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,159
I didn’t expect you to join
the demons in Sky Hall.

60
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,999
I was forced to a dead end
by your so-called righteous sects.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,234
I was almost dead.

62
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,665
Only the demons gave me a place to hide.

63
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,094
Why can’t I join them?

64
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,959
But, I have to
thank you for this.

65
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,523
If not, I wouldn’t be the
glorious person I am right now.

66
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,799
You’re welcome.

67
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,519
You deserved everything
due to your evil deeds.

68
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,920
You don’t need to find excuses
and blame others for your mistakes.

69
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,079
It’s been so many years,
but I didn’t expect

70
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,170
Lize Palace and Shaoyang Sect
to still be in a good relationship.

71
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:34,519
This is so interesting.

72
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,199
You became a lackey of Sky Hall.

73
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,808
You felt proud even though
you were just their lackey.

74
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,356
Isn’t that more interesting?

75
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,997
All of you, listen up.

76
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,079
I will make those who had
insulted me pay thousandfold.

77
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,297
If you don’t want to end up
like the old guys in Xuanyuan Sect,

78
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,058
you better give me the spirit key.

79
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,537
Xuanyuan Sect?

80
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,898
Don’t tell me you’ve...

81
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,434
It’s a pity that you didn’t
get to witness it for yourself.

82
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:07,733
Your Sect Leader Zhu Shi, he
was killed by his own disciples.

83
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,599
I made them kill him
in exchange for the antidote.

84
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,423
You didn’t see how
hardworking they were

85
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:15,199
in order to obtain the antidote.

86
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,649
You!

87
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,343
This is just the start.

88
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:20,759
Just wait and see.

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,711
I’ll reduce all your righteous sects
into ashes.

90
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,592
In order to appease my hatred!

91
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
Take them down! Leave none of them alive!

92
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,644
Bring them and retreat! Cover me!

93
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,064
What are you trying to do?

94
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,120
Protect the spirit key! Go now!

95
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,688
Run!

96
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,399
- Stand down!
- Who is this?

97
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,079
Who exactly are you?

98
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,801
Why are you always appearing in my dream?

99
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:09,322
You think you’re great after
you’ve slain many Asuras?

100
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,799
Even the Jade Emperor
can’t save you now!

101
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,399
What did I do wrong?

102
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,079
You were in the wrong!

103
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Dingkun Sword!

104
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,768
- Ling Long.
- Little Six.

105
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,319
Are you okay?

106
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,773
I’m okay.

107
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,727
Over there.

108
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,959
Si Feng!

109
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,443
Si Feng!

110
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,976
Si Feng, please wake up!

111
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,475
Si Feng!

112
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,338
Si Feng, you...

113
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,147
Si Feng!

114
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,015
Si Feng!

115
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,279
Si Feng!

116
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,600
Si Feng, are you okay?

117
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,762
This...

118
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,142
Si Feng!

119
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,599
Si Feng, are you awake?

120
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,010
Si Feng!

121
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,799
You’re finally awake!

122
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,204
Xuan Ji?

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,039
Are you okay?

124
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,439
Are you hurt anywhere?

125
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,560
Don’t worry, I’m fine.

126
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,697
The water flushed us into this valley.

127
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:26,938
That’s why Wu Tong
wasn’t able to pursue us.

128
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,079
That’s good.

129
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,559
Don’t move.

130
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,959
I’m applying medicine for you.

131
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,316
I’ve dressed up all your
wounds except for this area.

132
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,403
Don’t worry. I’ve checked your body.

133
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,074
There are no other wounds.

134
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,037
Xuan Ji,

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,440
did you see anything else

136
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
besides my wounds?

137
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,490
What do you mean?

138
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:01,942
Listen, I need to dress
up this wound for you.

139
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,983
That way, you’ll heal faster.

140
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,162
Chu Xuan Ji,

141
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,760
why do you always remove
a man’s clothes without any care?

142
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,200
You’re a lady.
It’s impolite for you to do so.

143
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,759
I...

144
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,054
But, when you did the same thing
four years ago,

145
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:36,552
you said we mustn’t be shy
when it comes to applying medicine.

146
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,313
Remove your clothes now.

147
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,599
- What exactly are you trying to do?
- I want to help you.

148
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,053
No need.

149
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,959
I don’t need your help.

150
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,423
I’ll do it myself.

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,160
I’ll inspect my wounds over there.

152
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,218
Si Feng, I told you not to move.

153
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,760
Your wounds won’t be able to heal
if you move around.

154
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,109
My mask!

155
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,479
Where’s my mask?

156
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,399
Your mask?

157
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,690
You were bleeding underneath your mask.

158
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:23,459
I thought you were seriously injured.

159
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,980
I removed the mask because I was anxious.

160
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,696
You removed it?

161
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,240
Did you really remove it?

162
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,480
Si Feng, did I do something wrong again?

163
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,201
I’m so dumb.

164
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:45,800
I forgot about the rules of your sect.
I shouldn’t remove your mask like that.

165
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,919
Don’t worry.

166
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,223
It’s outside. I’ll get it back for you.

167
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,717
Xuan Ji!

168
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:55,514
I...

169
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,479
Si Feng, what’s wrong?

170
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,004
Do you feel uncomfortable?

171
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,129
I’m just happy.

172
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,199
Si Feng!

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,839
Si Feng!

174
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,279
Si Feng, what’s wrong?

175
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,566
Are your wounds hurting again?

176
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,882
Sit down now. Slowly.

177
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:18,137
Come.

178
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,215
Si Feng,

179
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,519
are you okay?

180
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,280
I’m so happy right now.

181
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,199
Do you know?

182
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,723
I was worried that

183
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
you couldn’t remove the mask.

184
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,794
I thought

185
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,719
I would have to wait for a long time.

186
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Si Feng, you’re not angry?

187
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,439
You wouldn’t even let me touch
your mask in the past, you know?

188
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,679
- But this time...
- Silly girl.

189
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,400
You knew it all along, didn’t you?

190
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,028
I didn’t mean what I said.

191
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,226
I wished you would look at it
and touch it.

192
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,427
I hoped you would remove the mask.

193
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,783
I originally thought
that this great fortune

194
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,944
would not embrace me this soon.

195
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,385
Why is removing the mask sometimes good

196
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:18,330
and sometimes bad to Lize Palace?

197
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,251
I don’t understand.

198
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,406
Silly girl.

199
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,440
It’s complicated.

200
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,781
You just need to know that

201
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
only the person whom
the holder treasures the most

202
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,360
can remove the mask.

203
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
If that person can remove it,

204
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:37,559
the mask will become a smiling mask.

205
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,207
It becomes a blessing.

206
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,608
And it’s a good thing.

207
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
But if that person can’t remove it,

208
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
it’ll be a sad story.

209
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,760
And it’ll become a crying mask.

210
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,707
Until... Until what?

211
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,037
That’s not important.

212
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,849
The important thing is

213
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
you’ve removed the mask.

214
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,254
I know.

215
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,360
I know we’re thinking the same thing.

216
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
We’ll return to Lize Palace

217
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
once we leave this place.

218
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,842
We’ll meet my master together
and give him an explanation.

219
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,520
Will your master punish you again?

220
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,799
I need to return to Lize Palace

221
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,400
and give an explanation no matter what.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,421
Only then,

223
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,160
Only then I can account for you.

224
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,710
After that,

225
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
we’ll be together forever.

226
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,720
Together forever with you?

227
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,348
Si Feng,

228
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,440
why did your face change colour?

229
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Are you blushing?

230
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,519
I’m not.

231
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,959
You are.

232
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,394
- You are. Look.
- I’m not.

233
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,199
- You’re blushing.
- I’m not.

234
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,199
Look at your blushing face.

235
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,759
This is great!

236
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,679
I can be with you forever!

237
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,799
Si Feng, you’re the best!

238
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,359
- Look!
- Stop it.

239
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,160
You’re blushing!

240
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:18,761
I’m not.

241
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,861
Xuan Ji, you said you
can see colours now.

242
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,959
Tell me then. What colour did you see?

243
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
Red colour.

244
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,276
You can see colours now?

245
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:41,477
I saw your face turning red.

246
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,040
Look, it’s still red.

247
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,786
Si Feng!

248
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,400
Xuan Ji, stop it.

249
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,840
Xuan Ji, can you identify
other colours besides red?

250
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,507
Ling Long said the wedding dress is red.

251
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,031
And eyebrows are black, am I right?

252
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,444
Yes.

253
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:21,607
Si Feng, are your eyebrows same
as what was written in the book?

254
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,208
Are they as black as ink?

255
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,439
You’re right. They’re black.

256
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,800
What’s the colour of your lips then?

257
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,075
They’re red as well.

258
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,294
But why are our lips and the
wedding dress different in colour?

259
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,239
Both of them are red.

260
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,752
The wedding dress is bright red in colour.

261
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,201
It’s dazzling.

262
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:52,479
Our lips are pinkish red in colour.

263
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,019
They’re gentle and elegant.

264
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,439
There are so many
different hues to a colour?

265
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,799
Si Feng, what colour
is the land then?

266
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,281
The land is yellow in colour.

267
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,942
Si Feng, there are so many colours
in the world.

268
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,183
Which colour is the best?

269
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,614
Red.

270
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Because women look best when
they wear a red wedding dress.

271
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,258
Si Feng, did I do the right
thing by removing your mask?

272
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,559
Of course.

273
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,149
Since I did something right,
shouldn’t you grant me a request?

274
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:41,650
No problem.

275
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,011
I’ll change your dressing for you then.

276
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,866
It must be painful.

277
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,859
It does.

278
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,481
That’s why you need to
dress up your wounds.

279
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:03,402
You won’t be in pain after that.

280
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,600
Tell me if it’s too painful.

281
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,684
Yan Ran, are you okay?

282
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,119
I’m fine.

283
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
Your mask...

284
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,599
It fell by itself.
I have nothing to do with it.

285
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,160
Don’t blame me for this.

286
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,759
You should try and patch it together.

287
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,543
Never mind.

288
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:12,571
The mask has been broken.

289
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:14,412
It won’t return to its original state.

290
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:17,266
I will return and accept my punishment.

291
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,040
I wonder how Si Feng
and the rest are doing?

292
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,920
We shouldn’t waste any time.

293
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,120
Let’s go.

294
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,695
Let’s go.

295
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,560
- Did you discover anything?
- No.

296
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,879
Stop wasting time here.

297
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,239
Our leader asked us to search
from the top to the bottom.

298
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,439
We must find those cultivators.

299
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,361
- And obtain the spirit key.
- Yes.

300
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,487
Let’s go.

301
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,279
I wonder if Xuan Ji and the rest are safe?

302
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,776
You have the Sound Bell with you, right?

303
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,399
Try and see if you can contact them.

304
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,993
You’re right.

305
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,199
Xuan Ji, can you hear me?

306
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,490
Ling Long.

307
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,043
How are you doing?

308
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:32,951
I’m with Min Yan. We’re fine.

309
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:34,639
Where are you?
We’ll look for you.

310
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,642
No need. Don’t come and find us.

311
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:39,652
Si Feng and I are
in the bottom of a valley.

312
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,879
The undercurrent took us
to an unknown location.

313
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,637
You don’t need to find us.

314
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:45,561
You should leave Mount Gao now.

315
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:47,105
How could I just leave without you?

316
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:49,599
Moreover, I don’t know the location of
Ruo Yu and Yan Ran.

317
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,708
We don’t know where we are,
but we’re safe.

318
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,614
We’ll find a way out later.

319
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,331
It’s dangerous for you to stay there.

320
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,023
You should report to Fuyu Island.

321
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,639
Ruo Yu and Yan Ran should be fine.

322
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,559
We’ll try to contact them
after we leave this place.

323
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,675
Okay. You be careful then.

324
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,999
The spirit key is hidden inside
the Destiny Pearl in Xuan Ji’s hand.

325
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,964
You should rush back to Fuyu Island
and hand it over to the elders there.

326
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:13,605
See you on Fuyu Island.

327
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,919
It’s good that they’re fine.

328
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,639
I didn’t expect the Destiny Pearl
to attract demons from Sky Hall.

329
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,608
And I didn’t expect Wu Tong
to be one of them as well.

330
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:27,235
I’m afraid Xuanyuan Sect is gone now.

331
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:30,183
If it weren’t for Mount Gao’s
complex structure,

332
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,142
we would’ve been gone as well.

333
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:34,959
Sky Hall is far more stronger
than we thought.

334
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,961
If our sects don’t work together
against them,

335
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:41,640
they’ll become a big threat.

336
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:45,239
Si Feng, are your wounds hurting again?

337
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,559
You were severely wounded.

338
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,519
You need some food to recover.

339
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,799
Wait for me. I’ll find you some food.

340
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,016
Be careful.

341
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,480
Don’t worry. I have no problem
finding food.

342
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,759
Chu Xuan Ji has the spirit key indeed.

343
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,106
We’ve surrounded the entire mountain,
but we couldn’t find anyone.

344
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:17,053
I was thinking that you
might be hiding here.

345
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,534
I was right.

346
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,503
Wu Tong, you gave
up on being a human.

347
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:24,094
You became the lackey of demons instead.

348
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,959
You wretch!

349
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,531
Take them down!

350
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
Ling Long!

351
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,839
Wretch, you’re
finally in my hands!

352
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,270
You pervert! Let me go!

353
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,818
You’re still as stubborn as ever.

354
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
Where’s Chu Xuan Ji?

355
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,535
Min Yan!

356
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,239
- Despicable!
- I’m despicable?

357
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,999
The Five Great Sects are despicable
for trying to hunt me down!

358
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,835
I still have debts to settle
with the Five Great Sects.

359
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,738
As long as you’re in my hand,
I’m sure your sister will show up.

360
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,559
Kill him.

361
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,085
Let go of me!

362
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,511
Ling Long!

363
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,719
Ling Long!

364
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
Ling Long!

365
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,109
Strange.

366
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,279
Is this a barrier?

367
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,976
I can’t cast any spells.

368
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,817
I can’t leave as well.

369
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,520
The Four Sacred Beasts are here
to report the current situation.

370
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,672
King Bailing is not here.

371
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,473
Just leave the report here.

372
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,087
It’s Flying Snake again.

373
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,208
It can’t stop creating trouble.

374
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,639
This is too much!

375
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,475
King Bailing only wanted
you to keep watch over me

376
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,955
so that I would not create trouble.

377
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:19,119
But now, I have something to do
in the human realm!

378
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,607
Our king said that
if you leave this place,

379
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,000
you’ll wreak havoc down below.

380
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,761
That’s why you won’t be able to leave.

381
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,999
It’s glowing.

382
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,639
It’s glowing!

383
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,440
Look, it’s glowing!
You know what this is, right?

384
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,039
When the God of War was punished,
her sword was sent to the human realm too.

385
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,079
Her Dingkun Sword is hard to control.

386
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,959
King Bailing had no choice
but to seal it away.

387
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,560
And he gave the medallion to me.

388
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,408
That’s why I became Lord Flying Snake.

389
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,799
Someone is trying to take
the Dingkun Sword!

390
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,720
Let me leave and check that out!

391
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,959
My lord, you’re the guardian of
Dingkun Sword. This is not a joke.

392
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,200
- Please stop joking around.
- Glow!

393
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,919
Glow now!

394
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,306
Hurry up and glow!

395
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:12,134
Lord Flying Snake, if you do this again,

396
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:14,455
I’ll call for Lord Green Dragon.

397
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,695
Fine. I won’t argue with you.

398
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,336
I’ll go back to sleep.

399
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,960
Listen, I’m not doing this because
I’m afraid of that Green Dragon.

400
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,359
Xuan Ji!

401
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,719
- Si Feng!
- Are you okay?

402
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,665
The lightning is trying to strike me!

403
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,215
Let’s go in!

404
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,902
Why would it try to strike you?

405
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:22,907
I don’t know. Seems like
there’s a barrier around it.

406
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:25,446
We’re isolated from the outside world.
We can’t cast any spell.

407
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,725
Look, there are
no other living beings here.

408
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:28,924
And we can’t leave as well.

409
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:30,365
Actually, we don’t need to worry.

410
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,151
We need to be here
for a few days no matter what.

411
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:35,079
It’s the same with or without the barrier.

412
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,117
Think about it. We came out of the pool.

413
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,880
I’ll see if we can leave using the
same route after my wounds healed.

414
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,639
We still need to be here for a few days?

415
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,775
It’s lucky that I’m smart.

416
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:50,629
I’ve gathered many fruits.

417
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,439
We will starve to death without them.

418
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,604
Xuan Ji, you’re the best.

419
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,245
I’ll wash them for you.

420
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,689
Is it nice?

421
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,680
It is.

422
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,200
You should eat more then.

423
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,048
It’s delicious.

424
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,309
It’s that good?

425
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,479
Si Feng, this is very bitter.

426
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,200
It’s not nice at all.

427
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,519
Apricot kernels are bitter naturally.

428
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,600
I’m afraid your tummy has to
suffer for a few days.

429
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,883
That will be the saddest thing in life.

430
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,069
I figured you would be hungry
in the mountains.

431
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,919
I brought a bun.

432
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,575
You should eat this.

433
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,495
This will be so delicious.

434
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,600
Si Feng, you should have some as well.

435
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,839
No thanks.

436
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,959
I only eat the buns from Yongfang Court.

437
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,759
You’re being particular
even when we’re in this situation?

438
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,456
I’ll rather be particular
than to compromise.

439
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,192
If I must choose,

440
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:20,120
I would choose wild fruits over
buns that are not from Yongfang Court.

441
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,888
Do you know what I feel like eating now?

442
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,768
Osmanthus cake with lotus seed
from Liufengzhai.

443
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,599
It’s sweet, delicious, and fragrant.

444
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,735
This is the cake.

445
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,688
Delicious.

446
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:41,848
This will be the most delicious
Peach Chicken from my house then.

447
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,689
The Eight Treasure Duck
from Guangyun Court.

448
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,438
Roasted deer.

449
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,679
The beef noodles in Kelaiju Inn
are great as well.

450
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,959
With so many delicious dishes,

451
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,607
and with some Drunken
Dragon from Liuxianlou, cheers.

452
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,479
- This is so delicious!
- Eat this then.

453
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,514
I won’t eat that. I’ll leave it for you.

454
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:09,053
I’ll eat this.

455
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,029
Si Feng.

456
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,379
Cover yourself.

457
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,620
Let’s sleep together.

458
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,400
You’re really testing me all the time.

459
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,640
I’m not a saint.

460
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,839
Do you know how happy
I was when I knew that

461
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,720
you could remove my mask?

462
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,240
If you continue this,

463
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
I won’t be able to stand it anymore.

464
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,280
I know now.

465
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,000
I know you can pass your message
to other people with this.

466
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:34,541
Is this the thing you use to
contact Chu Xuan Ji?

467
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,591
Seems like it is.

468
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,432
How do you use this?

469
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,833
Ask Chu Xuan Ji to hand over
the spirit key right now.

470
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,319
No way.

471
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,743
Wretch, how dare you reject me!

472
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:55,584
You’re in my hands.

473
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,920
If you don’t follow my orders,

474
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,359
I have more than a thousand ways
to deal with you.

475
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,200
I will let you suffer so much
that you wish you were dead.

476
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,959
I will make you suffer
until you follow my orders.

477
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,479
Do you want to try it now?

478
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,200
You better listen to me right now.

479
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,119
I hate lackeys like you the most!

480
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,905
I hate it even more when
I’m threatened by a lackey!

481
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,826
You’ll never get the spirit key!

482
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,207
Young Lady, you’re
overestimating yourself.

483
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,319
The Sky Hall has countless demons inside.

484
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,481
Do you think I can only obtain the
spirit key by holding you as a hostage?

485
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:04,568
I’m just teasing you.

486
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,849
It’s more interesting
when you don’t listen to me.

487
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,959
We’ve been missing our marks lately.

488
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,519
- What should we do?
- This mustn’t continue on.

489
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,848
- Let’s walk around.
- Yes.

490
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,816
Why is there a person here?

491
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,035
- Let’s have a look.
- Let’s go!

492
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,292
So beautiful!

493
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,884
Si Feng,

494
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,960
what colour is this?

495
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,676
The hydrangea is blue.

496
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,583
This is blue?

497
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,140
It’s nice.

498
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:03,305
My favourite colour is blue!

499
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:06,266
You have decided to like the colour blue?

500
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,804
I like it since I was young.

501
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:12,205
I’ll bring it with me and I’ll show it
to Ling Long and Sixth Senior.

502
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,359
Xuan Ji, let’s check if
there’s an exit over there.

503
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,320
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

504
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
This is strange.

505
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,283
We were washed ashore by the same pool.

506
00:42:41,284 --> 00:42:44,044
But now, we can’t even touch the water.

507
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,678
We’ve been stuck here for some days.

508
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,959
We couldn’t contact Ling Long
and Min Yan as well.

509
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,492
What should we do?

510
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:02,639
We should try and seek another exit.

511
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,539
I think something is hidden in here.

512
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,879
That’ll explain the barrier.

513
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,440
I’m sure the barrier has a weakness.

514
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,800
Xuan Ji, where’s my mask?

515
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,343
The mask? Didn’t you say
you don’t need it anymore?

516
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,024
We still need to find it?

517
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,263
I need to bring it back in order
to give my master an explanation.

518
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:28,384
Maybe, it could even help us out.

519
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,719
The mask is made from the bark
of the Undying Tree.

520
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,361
It’s filled with spiritual energy.

521
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,202
Maybe it can help us
break through the barrier.

522
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,599
Si Feng,

523
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,180
didn’t you say the mask will become
a smiling mask after it was removed?

524
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:53,181
Why is it crying?
