1
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,351
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,624
<i>EPISODE 10</i>

3
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,358
It’s exactly as Si Feng said.

4
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,239
Does everyone
in Lize Palace know this spell?

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,280
It’s embarrassing to say this.
I don’t know these spells.

6
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,919
Si Feng is gifted.

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,758
The usual disciples of Lize Palace
can’t even compete with him.

8
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,839
If it wasn’t for
the palace lord forcing him,

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,758
I don’t even know what would happen.

10
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,597
His natural gift might be wasted.

11
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,479
What’s wrong with Si Feng?
Why did your palace lord force him?

12
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,719
It’s nothing much.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,199
He just wants him to go back to
the right path. But Si Feng...

14
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,719
Outsiders cannot ask about
what happened at Lize Palace.

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,039
Ruo Yu, you talked too much. Let’s go.

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,319
What does Lize Palace
got to do with you then?

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,719
You don’t see yourself as an outsider?

18
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,319
What do you know?

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,679
- I know everything.
- Enough.

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,751
- What don’t I know?
- What do you know?

21
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,787
- What do you know then?
- Enough.

22
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,192
- What’s wrong with me?
- Stop arguing.

23
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,820
The exit is near.

24
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,061
Let’s go.

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,991
- Move! Me first!
- Don’t be rash!

26
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:59,320
Get up!

27
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
Ling Long!

28
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,399
Si Feng! Don’t go!

29
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,110
Don’t worry. I’ve recovered.

30
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,397
You should be worried
about Zhong Min Yan.

31
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:22,240
I do, but I...

32
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,279
Shaoyang’s Transmission Charm?

33
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,800
This is bad!
Ling Long and the rest are in trouble!

34
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,925
- Bird demon!
- Let us go!

35
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:34,359
I’ll kill you if I get out!

36
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,431
Ugly little demon! Let us go!

37
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,640
Stop arguing at this time!

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,640
Ling Long!

39
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,519
If Xuan Ji and Si Feng
are baited by the charm,

40
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,999
how much of
Si Feng’s power will be recovered?

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,359
Within an hour of using the secret arts,

42
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,759
even if force was used,
only 30% of the power will be recovered.

43
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,959
It’s bad.

44
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,040
Do you think we will be annihilated?

45
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,799
Careful! Don’t come here!

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Let them go!

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,879
- Ling Long!
- Beware of traps.

48
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,439
You are the one who hurt me?

49
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,239
Yes. You fool!

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,480
How dare you embarrass yourself here?

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
Look out!

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,240
- Save them. I will kill him.
- Alright.

53
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Xuan Ji, look out!

54
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,640
- Xuan Ji!
- Si Feng!

55
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

57
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,040
Si Feng!

58
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Si Feng.

59
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,799
What are you?

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,640
Who are you

61
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,999
to ask me?

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,999
The two stars will merge soon.

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,040
No one can stop
Sky Hall from doing what they want!

64
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
Si Feng!

65
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,880
Xuan Ji.

66
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,023
Xuan Ji.

67
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Xuan Ji!

68
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:32,183
Xuan Ji.

69
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,040
Xuan Ji.

70
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,959
Si Feng!

71
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,159
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji.

72
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,079
- Si Feng.
- Xuan Ji, how are you?

73
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,400
Xuan Ji.

74
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,719
- Si Feng.
- I’m fine.

75
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,919
What’s wrong with Xuan Ji?

76
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,239
Xuan Ji’s Yang Jue Skill is
between level seven and eight.

77
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,296
Her mental state is unstable.
Something went wrong.

78
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,359
She passed out due to exhaustion.

79
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,319
It’ll be fine when she wakes up.

80
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,519
Really?

81
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,199
Why didn’t I know?

82
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,119
How did you know?

83
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,159
What do you mean something went wrong?
She almost killed Si Feng!

84
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,518
Xuan Ji didn’t do it on purpose.

85
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,879
- What do you mean?
- She wanted to save him

86
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,359
and went mad.

87
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,559
I’m fine.

88
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
She didn’t do it on purpose.

89
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,854
No more arguments

90
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,279
now that the demon is killed.

91
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,479
Ruo Yu.

92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Let’s take a look over there.

93
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,599
Si Feng.

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Why did you release all the Quru Birds?

95
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,598
They were controlled by the Aoyin.

96
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,079
Now that the Aoyin is dead,

97
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,119
the Quru Birds are harmless.

98
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,278
That Aoyin cleaned the furnace beforehand.

99
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,559
There’s no residue at all.

100
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,079
I wonder what did these Zhuyu Grass
were used for.

101
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,799
This demon said it was from Sky Hall,
and said some unknown things.

102
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,461
I wonder what Sky Hall is planning?

103
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,429
Unexpectedly, Sky Hall seems like
they disappeared for the past four years

104
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,279
but they have been
doing something secretly.

105
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,160
We don’t understand what does
two stars merging for now as well.

106
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,462
Why don’t we send

107
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,222
letters back to our sects

108
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,320
to warn them?

109
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Look out!

110
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,155
- What is that?
- No worries.

111
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:31,879
That is Aoyin’s tendon.
It’s a stubborn thing.

112
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,142
It will be stuck onto flesh and blood.

113
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,759
It’s a great material
to make Demon Tying Rope.

114
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,360
Si Feng, let’s go back
since the demon is dead.

115
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,560
Let’s first regroup at Wangxian Town.

116
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,575
If you have no place to stay,

117
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,719
we can stay together.

118
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
Alright.

119
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,599
Master, are you still going
to visit Chu Xuan Ji?

120
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,519
You’ll be worried
as long as she isn’t awake, right?

121
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,703
You should know the Loveless Mask
prevents you from falling in love.

122
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,359
You shouldn’t stay here.

123
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,199
I know more about you

124
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,920
regarding my life.

125
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,198
Nothing worries me here.

126
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,399
Find the shopkeeper to pay for the room.

127
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
We are leaving.

128
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Master is trying to pay for the room.

129
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:29,560
Master, wait for me.

130
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,279
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji.

131
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,599
You’re awake?

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
How are you?

133
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,679
Where’s the Aoyin?

134
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,359
We were saved?

135
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,396
How were we saved?

136
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,719
Also, Si Feng.

137
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,518
- Is Si Feng alright?
- Xuan Ji.

138
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,879
Don’t worry.

139
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,214
You killed the Aoyin. Don’t you remember?

140
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:05,480
Me?

141
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,967
Xuan Ji went mad at that time.

142
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:10,999
She had no conscience.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,559
Xuan Ji, when you practise next time,
try to be safe, and don’t rush.

144
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,960
I...

145
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,559
Don’t think too much.

146
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,199
Oh, the people of Wangxian Town

147
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,439
want to thank us
with a banquet downstairs.

148
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,639
I’m sure there are
many delicious food for you.

149
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,919
Pack up.

150
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,599
Let’s...

151
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,879
Sixth Senior.

152
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,960
I still have something else to ask you.

153
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,319
Ling Long,

154
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,926
I have something
to talk about with Xuan Ji.

155
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,319
Why don’t you head down,
and greet them first?

156
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
I’ll head there with Xuan Ji soon.

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
Alright.

158
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,359
What is Xuan Ji hiding from me?

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,118
Even if there’s a secret,

160
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,270
it should be a secret with me.

161
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,471
When did Little Six and her...

162
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,414
Si Feng, you must be here to see Xuan Ji.

163
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:29,719
Don’t worry, Xuan Ji is awake.

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,994
But, she has something
to talk about with Little Six.

165
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,559
It’s inconvenient for you to go there.

166
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,519
Chu Xuan Ji’s condition
is none of our business.

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,119
No one cares. Don’t think too much.

168
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,604
No one cares?

169
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:40,519
Si Feng cares.

170
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,719
I know you don’t care.
No one cares whether you care or not.

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,640
- Si Feng doesn’t care...
- Immortal master!

172
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,598
The immortal masters are here.

173
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,548
We have nothing
to repay for the immortal masters’

174
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:52,778
help for Wangxian Town.

175
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,523
We can only prepare
a simple banquet to thank all of you.

176
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:57,519
All of you must not reject our invitation.

177
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,679
- Please head there.
- Please.

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,679
Go on ahead.
I’ll invite other immortal masters.

179
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,189
It’s alright. My sister and another senior
have something to talk about.

180
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,359
- They will go later.
- Sure.

181
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,160
Please head over there.

182
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,280
Isn’t that the same as
what happened with Gudiao?

183
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,719
Why did it happen again?

184
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,399
Also, I’m always feeling that
I did something to Si Feng.

185
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,759
Sixth Senior.

186
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
Can you tell me
what happened at that time?

187
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:30,302
You were pointing your fingertips
at Si Feng.

188
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,119
You almost...

189
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,279
But you stopped immediately.
Si Feng is fine.

190
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
- You didn’t hurt him.
- I...

191
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,830
I dreamt of it.

192
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,798
Inside my dreams,

193
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,894
I was always killing people.

194
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,599
I was covered in blood.

195
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,534
But why can’t I feel anything?

196
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:52,840
I...

197
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:54,919
I...

198
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,959
I almost killed Si Feng.

199
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,359
That’s not it, Xuan Ji.

200
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,919
That was just a dream.

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,079
But it almost came true.

202
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,632
I wanted to protect everyone.

203
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:09,199
But I couldn’t control myself.

204
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,519
I am afraid that I will become a monster

205
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,279
who recognises no one
and kills for no reason.

206
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,559
That won’t happen, Xuan Ji.

207
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,300
Calm down.
Don’t confuse your dream with reality.

208
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,119
But those dreams...

209
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,470
When the dreams overlapped
with the shards,

210
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:29,920
they...

211
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:33,323
Everyone. A toast to the immortal masters.

212
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,672
If it weren’t for
their help to kill the demon,

213
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,410
Wangxian Town will
have to suffer from a famine.

214
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:41,320
- Thank you, immortal masters.
- Thank you, immortal masters.

215
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:49,134
The people of Wangxian Town want
to thank us with a banquet downstairs.

216
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,319
Sixth Senior.

217
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,760
I still have something else to ask you.

218
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,518
Ling Long, I have something
to talk about with Xuan Ji.

219
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,886
Why don’t you head down...

220
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:03,240
Si Feng.

221
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,959
Si Feng, let’s leave after the meal.

222
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,318
Why are you in a rush again?
We just sat down.

223
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,166
Si Feng knows what he is doing.

224
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,918
He won’t be rushing to his death.

225
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,110
Don’t say that word again. How dare you?

226
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,359
Enough.

227
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,598
Just eat.

228
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,959
Si Feng.

229
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,080
Si Feng.

230
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:34,239
Si Feng, why won’t you drink with me?

231
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,559
Why are you so cold towards me?

232
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,999
You forgot about our relationship?

233
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,759
You forgot that we killed the Gudiao
and save the merman together?

234
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,255
You forgot that we went to Dianjinggu
to punish Wu Tong?

235
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,559
Stop talking.

236
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,151
- Shut up!
- You...

237
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:49,200
Enough. Let’s eat.

238
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,039
Zhuyu Grass?

239
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,159
It was used as fuel.

240
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,607
I see.

241
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,046
Sixth Senior.

242
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,734
I am too afraid.

243
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:20,399
The merman told me

244
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,325
I am not my complete self.

245
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,277
What if

246
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,358
I can’t control myself one day

247
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,079
and make all those dreams come true?

248
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,222
Merman?

249
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,639
You mean the shards
of the Mirror of Origin?

250
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,960
Why are you mentioning this again?
Didn’t you say you will forget about it?

251
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,118
Senior Hao Chen

252
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,478
did forbid me
to find the Mirror of Origin.

253
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,479
But

254
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,399
I didn’t give him the shard I have.

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,039
- I’m always feeling...
- Xuan Ji.

256
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,120
Do you still have the shard with you?

257
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,039
That must be the problem.

258
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,999
Don’t be deceived by the merman.

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,026
Demons like to deceive people,
and create a demon in them.

260
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,582
I’m sure you have a demon in you.

261
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,000
A demon in me?

262
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:07,522
Why did the demon used me?

263
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:09,719
How would I know
about a demon’s evil deeds?

264
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,399
It’s just like
the Aoyin controlling the Quru Birds

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,909
to destroy all the Zhuyu Grass here.

266
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,959
We don’t know the reason for that too.

267
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,159
Xuan Ji, don’t be afraid.

268
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,697
It’s nothing.

269
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,239
Let’s destroy the shard

270
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,840
and it won’t affect you again.

271
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,493
That darn Chu Xuan Ji.

272
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:27,054
Why did I meet her?

273
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,119
I can’t allow Si Feng
to get mixed up with her again.

274
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,400
I might as well do the extreme.

275
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,332
Sixth Senior.
Why don’t we forget about it?

276
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,359
Let’s hand it to Master.

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,519
- No!
- Even though...

278
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,359
I don’t know
what kind of troubles you will get into.

279
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,999
We can’t tell others.

280
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,319
Let’s try again.
Think of a way to destroy it

281
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
and let it become an eternal secret.

282
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,120
Look out!

283
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,759
- Sixth Senior. I can’t move.
- I feel numb too.

284
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,597
I think the spell got reflected.

285
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,991
What about the shard?

286
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,710
The shard has been destroyed.
It’s all over.

287
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,839
But, we are in this situation.

288
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,720
- Why don’t we call for help?
- No.

289
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,461
How can we explain this?

290
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:34,917
We can’t call them.

291
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,839
How should I explain this?

292
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,286
Use your qi.

293
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,687
Use your qi to break the spell.

294
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,240
Si Feng.

295
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,852
You forgot how well you treated Xuan Ji?

296
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,955
Xuan Ji got hurt because she took
the hairpin from Wu Tong for you.

297
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,239
You cared about her.

298
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,782
I always thought you liked Xuan Ji.

299
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:01,960
What’s wrong with you?

300
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,639
That’s nonsense.

301
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,479
Lize Palace has its rules.

302
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,439
Disciples should not
be friends with others.

303
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,679
It’s my duty.

304
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,919
Duty?

305
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,120
Fine.

306
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,158
Let go of your duty today.

307
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,759
Did you really forget us?

308
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,319
You don’t care about us and Xuan Ji?

309
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,999
Anything exceeding my duty

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,719
will bring its consequences.

311
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,360
You don’t have to think too much.

312
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,919
Fine.

313
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,999
Fine, you forgot everything.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,479
It’s fine if you changed.

315
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,919
But the one who grew up with me...

316
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,959
The one who grew up with me

317
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,719
changed in an instant too.

318
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,917
I didn’t know anything about her

319
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:43,718
like a total stranger.

320
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,799
Si Feng, I think
I saw a shadow over there.

321
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
Do you think it’s a demon?

322
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,759
Where’s the demon?

323
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,479
Where’s the demon you saw?

324
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,999
I think I saw a shadow went in

325
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,679
but I’m not sure if it’s a demon.

326
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,239
Xuan Ji.

327
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,520
Xuan Ji!

328
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,319
Ling Long.

329
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,920
Ling Long, you’re finally here.

330
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,639
It’s not what it seems.

331
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,999
We are just...

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
- We are...
- Zhong Min Yan.

333
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,919
How dare you!
How dare you bully my sister?

334
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,359
- I won’t forgive you!
- Ling Long.

335
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,599
- He bullied you!
- No. Stop it.

336
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,462
Sixth Senior did not bully me.

337
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,439
Ling Long. Since we disturbed them,

338
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,599
- let’s just leave.
- Don’t touch me!

339
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,959
Let me tell you.

340
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,385
Don’t try to add fuel to the fire.

341
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,679
What did I do?

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,598
Can you explain what you are doing?

343
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,439
We were just...

344
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,320
- Zhong Min Yan, I’ll kill you!
- Ling Long!

345
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,639
Xuan Ji, he was bullying you
because he thought you are ignorant.

346
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,922
- Don’t you know that?
- No. Sixth Senior didn’t bully me.

347
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:15,759
He was just helping me. It’s true.

348
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
I was helping Xuan Ji with her troubles.

349
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,399
I tripped accidentally.

350
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,719
You want to kill me? Fine.

351
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
I’ll stand here. Kill me.

352
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,366
- You...
- Xuan Ji, move!

353
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:25,640
I’ll kill him!

354
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,302
You want to kill me?

355
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,533
Fine.

356
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,479
Let’s see how you kill me.

357
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,079
You don’t care anymore
once your temper comes up.

358
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,079
I’ve had enough. Kill me!

359
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,032
Don’t regret it.

360
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,479
You might hug me and cry

361
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,400
when you regain your consciousness.

362
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,613
Why should I regret?
I hate you in all of Shaoyang Sect.

363
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,868
If you die, I’ll laugh in my dreams.

364
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,239
Ling Long.

365
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,960
Stop it.

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,639
Use it to defend yourself.

367
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,918
Isn’t this your family heirloom?

368
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,639
Yes. It’s for my future wife.

369
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,200
This dagger

370
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
is with you.

371
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,959
This dagger was given to me
by Sixth Senior

372
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,119
before I went up to Xuyang Peak.

373
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,400
Yes.

374
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,000
I gave it to Xuan Ji.

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,600
He gave it to you four years ago?

376
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,358
Yes.

377
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,479
Young lady of Shaoyang Sect.
Isn’t that obvious?

378
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,279
Both of them were engaged with each other.

379
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,800
Being intimate for awhile
isn’t something surprising.

380
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,719
Xuan Ji.

381
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,360
He gave you his family heirloom dagger.

382
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,040
You are really going to be
a daughter-in-law of Zhong family.

383
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,360
Keep it well.

384
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,879
Zhong Min Yan.

385
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,323
In that case,

386
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,334
stop behaving casually

387
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,854
and treat Xuan Ji well.

388
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:33,342
I won’t forgive you

389
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,960
if you don’t.

390
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,080
Ling Long.

391
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,240
Si Feng, let’s leave.

392
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,288
Farewell.

393
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
Si Feng!

394
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,724
Silver Snake. Are you satisfied?

395
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,519
I admit that I lured you there

396
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,159
but she isn’t worth your time and efforts.
Isn’t that right?

397
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,039
You don’t have to do anything.

398
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,520
Si Feng!

399
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:17,879
Si Feng!

400
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,240
Si Feng!

401
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,960
Si Feng, don’t leave.
I have something to tell you.

402
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
I’m sorry. I’m busy.

403
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,981
Si Feng. We didn’t meet for four years.

404
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:39,990
I don’t want to leave you like this.

405
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:41,982
We are just strangers.

406
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,399
Stop pestering me.

407
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,680
Don’t get involved with me.

408
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,239
Si Feng!

409
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
Don’t touch it!

410
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,880
What is this?

411
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:15,532
<i>WINE</i>

412
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,680
Are you crying?

413
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,039
Leave me alone.

414
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,959
I have something to tell you.

415
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,279
I could give you an explanation
if you weren’t throwing a tantrum.

416
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,480
Yes. I’m stupid and foolish.
I didn’t see it clearly.

417
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,751
Do you have to act this way?

418
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,639
Can’t we talk at all?

419
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,280
- Can you let me finish...
- Zhong Min Yan!

420
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,159
In your eyes,

421
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,879
aren’t I a stubborn young lady
who always causes troubles?

422
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,773
You look down on me in your heart.

423
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:49,840
Why are you still compromising for me?

424
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,439
I don’t pay attention
to anyone unrelated anyway.

425
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,199
We will both go on our separate ways

426
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,679
in the future.

427
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,079
- Alright?
- Can’t I say a few words?

428
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,734
You are always like that
since you were young.

429
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:04,639
You don’t care whenever you got angry.

430
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,039
You don’t show mercy when you were right.
It’s worse if you were wrong.

431
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,599
Do you know what I’m going to say?
It’s fine.

432
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,720
If I have to say,
that Lu Yan Ran is more reasonable.

433
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,799
- At least...
- Great.

434
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,440
You are comparing me with Lu Yan Ran.
I wasted all my time on you.

435
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,559
You are just watching? Help!

436
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,645
It’s useless. Aoyin’s tendon will
grasp firmly on blood and flesh.

437
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,398
It depends on flesh and blood.

438
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,879
We can’t do anything

439
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,800
unless it releases its grasp willingly.

440
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
I’ll give you blood if you like them.

441
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,566
Release her and bind me.

442
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,960
Bind me.

443
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,119
It’s not moving.

444
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,358
Yan Ran.

445
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,439
I think the Aoyin tendon
likes Xuan Ji’s blood more.

446
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,119
It’s useless.

447
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,879
I don’t believe it.

448
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,320
Can’t it feel pain? Can’t I cut it?

449
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,728
It’s still not working.

450
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,439
Are you happy?

451
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,760
If I can’t cut it,
I can cut your hand instead.

452
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
You’ve caused enough trouble.

453
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,782
She’s the one who caused you trouble!

454
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:26,039
Chu Xuan Ji.

455
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,159
You caused such a big trouble.

456
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,079
Why are you smiling?

457
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,708
You’ve noticed it?

458
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,676
I made a mess today.

459
00:29:33,677 --> 00:29:35,919
It’s my bad for smiling.

460
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,199
But you won’t have to leave, right?

461
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,108
- Of course I’m happy.
- I have to leave anyway.

462
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,759
There’s no difference.
Don’t talk about these useless things.

463
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
That’s different.

464
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:47,343
She was trying to cut my hand off,
but you protected me.

465
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,959
That means you are worried
and still care about me.

466
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,601
- I’m happy.
- You think too much.

467
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:55,919
I stopped her because it won’t work.

468
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Do you think I want to drag
your dismembered arm along?

469
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,900
Si Feng, let’s not waste our time.

470
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,694
Isn’t Xuanyuan Sect nearby?

471
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:07,526
Sect Leader Zhu Shi
is knowledgeable and sophisticated.

472
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:09,101
I’m sure he can
deal with this Aoyin tendon.

473
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,439
That’s our only way.

474
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,959
Everyone is tired today. Rest early.

475
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,000
We will go to Xuanyuan Sect tomorrow.

476
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,839
What about her?

477
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,959
I’m telling you.
Don’t sleep in a room with Si Feng!

478
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,280
You hear me?

479
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,639
Then...

480
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,680
Where should I sleep tonight?

481
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,480
Si Feng.

482
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,134
I am very sleepy.

483
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:05,840
I can’t sit on the chair any longer.

484
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,239
Sleep.

485
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,719
Si Feng, where will you sleep?

486
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,399
You don’t have to worry.

487
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,320
I will explain to Zhong Min Yan tomorrow.

488
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:20,262
You have no choice,

489
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:22,120
but to stay here for the night.

490
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,816
Si Feng, I wanted to ask you.

491
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,618
Why is Ling Long so angry

492
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,634
about what happened
to me and Sixth Senior?

493
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:31,559
She even said Sixth Senior is so bad.

494
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,399
I think Sixth Senior is not bad.

495
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,654
You don’t know what is love.

496
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:39,239
- Don’t think about it.
- Who told you that?

497
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,910
I have someone I like too.

498
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,560
I like Sixth Senior.

499
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Aren’t you sleepy?

500
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,639
Why aren’t you sleeping?

501
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,758
I’m not sleepy now.

502
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,799
I don’t understand.

503
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,799
Although I like Sixth Senior,

504
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,766
Ling Long is just as important
as Sixth Senior.

505
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,799
I don’t wish
that either of them is unhappy.

506
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,839
They had a big argument this time

507
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,853
because I like Sixth Senior.

508
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:11,166
Do you think Ling Long
hates and looks down on Sixth Senior?

509
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:14,342
That was why she was angry
when she heard I like Sixth Senior.

510
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:18,279
Si Feng, since you are so smart,
can you help me?

511
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,720
Is there any way to let Ling Long
like Sixth Senior to?

512
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:31,679
I have no time to listen to
the issue between you and Zhong Min Yan.

513
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,726
If you are not sleepy,

514
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,385
just get out.

515
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,720
I’m sleepy.

516
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,278
I haven’t wrote to Senior Hao Chen
about my experience yet.

517
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,285
Si Feng ignores me too.

518
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:04,559
I should write to Senior Hao Chen.

519
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,799
Senior Hao Chen.

520
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,670
I didn’t write to you about my experience

521
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:10,391
because we met a demon recently.

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,919
The problem has been solved.

523
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,959
I will report to you about
what happened for the past two days.

524
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,159
First.

525
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,528
I met Si Feng, but he ignores me.

526
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:23,520
He is always trying to leave too.

527
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,839
I’m quite happy now that
he can’t leave at the moment.

528
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,040
I hope I can get back this
important friend of mine this time.

529
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,038
Second.

530
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,279
Ling Long and Sixth Senior
had a bad argument.

531
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,192
Ling Long said

532
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,302
her bazi doesn’t match with Sixth Senior’s

533
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:44,974
so they made up as quickly

534
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:47,039
as they start a new argument.

535
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,391
They always told me not to worry.

536
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,038
It would be better if they can get along

537
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,025
and care for each other.

538
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,350
- Xuan Ji, what are you doing?
- The fire...

539
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,806
Si Feng, the fire will shorten the tendon.

540
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,280
No!

541
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,806
Si Feng. I told you, right?

542
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,926
This thing will become shorter.

543
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,240
Hand.

544
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:30,014
Si Feng, how is your injury?

545
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,960
Let me take a look at your injury.

546
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,239
Chu Xuan Ji.

547
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,719
Why are you still so reckless?

548
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,079
This is improper.
Aren’t you engaged with Zhong Min Yan?

549
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,639
How could you do that?

550
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,719
I just want to take a look at your injury.

551
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
I don’t need your concern.

552
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,142
This bell...

553
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:23,320
Didn’t you say you threw it?

554
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,910
What does that have to do with you?

555
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,062
It’s a useless thing anyway.

556
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:30,479
I don’t know why it’s still with me.

557
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,840
You never realised
such a big thing on you?

558
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,079
- Don’t you feel anything at all?
- Chu Xuan Ji.

559
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,680
Why do you have so many questions?
How would I know?

560
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,160
You are hungry.

561
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,142
I’ll get you something delicious.

562
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:57,520
Alright.

563
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Delicious.

564
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:08,439
Si Feng, come closer.

565
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,880
Help me out. I can’t eat it otherwise.

566
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,480
It’s faster this way.
Go to sleep after you eat.

567
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,440
- Si Feng, aren’t you eating?
- Open your mouth.

568
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,774
This is delicious. Try it.

569
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,099
It’s fine.

570
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,934
- Try it.
- Shut up.

571
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,310
Eat.

572
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:37,431
Si Feng.

573
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,400
I can’t eat if I shut up.

574
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:42,800
Are you still eating?

575
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,880
I want the soup.

576
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,540
I want that.

577
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
That.

578
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,039
Are you full?

579
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
Yes.

580
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,734
Si Feng, look at this.

581
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,750
It turned back to normal.

582
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:47,919
Look.

583
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,120
Stop fooling around. Go to sleep.

584
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,374
Senior Hao Chen.
Nothing special happened.

585
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,759
Grilled fish was delicious.

586
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,982
We ate spicy hotpot.

587
00:38:07,983 --> 00:38:09,800
I’m very happy.

588
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,545
<i>It was fun.</i>

589
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:18,799
<i>I hope Father will
let us leave the sect more.</i>

590
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,879
Three.

591
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,805
We helped the people of Wangxian
Town deal with the problem of Quru Birds.

592
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,079
The people thanked us.

593
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,638
I’m quite happy.

594
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,479
Zhuyu Grass is so delicious.

595
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,286
It was wasted unfortunately.

596
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:32,439
Oh.

597
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,239
These Quru Birds
were controlled by an Aoyin demon

598
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,725
from sky hall.

599
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,613
The Aoyin demon said something
about two stars merging together.

600
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:41,680
We don’t know what it meant.

601
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,166
Si Feng.

602
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:06,127
Your shadow looks nice.

603
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:12,414
I forgot. You don’t like people
to praise you.

604
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:15,839
When I told you your smile looked nice,

605
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,828
you got angry all of a sudden.

606
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:21,280
I think you really look nice
when you smile.

607
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,254
But I never see your smile

608
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,440
ever since we met again.

609
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,838
I am very worried about you.
I don’t know what happened to you.

610
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,439
I regret it.

611
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,960
I think I missed out a lot of things.

612
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:44,678
Si Feng, I think it’s weird.

613
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,046
I still miss you

614
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:50,280
although you are right in front of me.

615
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Si Feng.

616
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
Si Feng.

617
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,080
Si Feng.

618
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:16,849
Are you asleep?

619
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,920
Si Feng.

620
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,159
Your mask

621
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,447
is different from the one in the past.

622
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,520
Don’t touch.

623
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,399
It’s just that

624
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,000
you won’t show me your face ever again?

625
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,959
Can’t we go back to how it used to be?

626
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,479
Finding the Mirror of Origin will fall
into the depths of desire and obsession.

627
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,574
Trapped by the demon within.
It’s bad for cultivating.

628
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,879
Sixth Senior always
uses this way to make people happy.

629
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,480
It works every time.

630
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,920
What’s wrong, Si Feng?
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

631
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,720
No.

632
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:50,240
I just think it’s funny.

633
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,040
Funny?

634
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,519
The past.

635
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,160
What happened before.

636
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,160
We can never return anymore.

637
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,600
Chu Xuan Ji.

638
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,301
Why do you still come near me?

639
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
The person I don’t want to see the most

640
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,440
while roaming the world is you.

641
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:16,800
We shouldn’t have met.

642
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,199
Why?

643
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,935
Why?

644
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,560
Tell me.

645
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,400
Why did you choose Zhong Min Yan?

646
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,799
I chose Sixth Senior?

647
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,600
What do you mean?

648
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,480
Why do you

649
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:42,080
like him?

650
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,519
Are you asking why I like Sixth Senior?

651
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,021
I think Sixth Senior is very nice.

652
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:50,957
I want to see him.

653
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,639
I feel happy with him.

654
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,680
I want to be with him forever.

655
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:57,830
He...

656
00:42:57,831 --> 00:42:59,840
We also have a secret.

657
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
Enough.

658
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,600
Stop it.

659
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:08,720
I understand.

660
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,240
You asked me for yourself.
Why are you getting angry?

661
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,120
Chu Xuan Ji.

662
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,800
Thanks for telling me all of these.

663
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,840
Si Feng.

664
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,960
- Me and you...
- I’m tired.

665
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
It’s getting late.

666
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I need to sleep.
