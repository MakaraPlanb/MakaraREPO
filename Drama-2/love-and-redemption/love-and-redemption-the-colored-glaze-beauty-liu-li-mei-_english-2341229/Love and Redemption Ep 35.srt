<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,216
<i>EPISODE 35</i>

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,365
Zhong Min Yan.

4
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,198
Are you guilty?

5
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,718
I am guilty.

6
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,239
Since you are guilty,
tell me about your crimes.

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,720
I, Zhong Min Yan,

8
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
disobeyed Master’s orders,
acted recklessly,

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,800
worked with demons,
and embarrassed the sect.

10
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,190
I even...

11
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,160
Who killed Min Jue?

12
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,680
It’s me.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,507
Father, Sixth Senior did it
because he was charmed by demons.

14
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:08,686
He didn’t do it on purpose.

15
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:10,279
- You can’t blame it on him.
- Shut up!

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,439
But...

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,559
No one can plead for him today!

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Xuan Ji.

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,119
I, Zhong Min Yan, killed
my fellow apprentice.

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,213
I’ve committed treason.
I have nothing to say.

21
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,958
Zhong Min Yan.

22
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,622
If you know you are guilty,

23
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:37,040
tell me how you
should be punished yourself.

24
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:41,840
I should kill myself.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,760
No! Sixth Senior!

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,559
Ling Long, your hand...

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,040
Who asked you to do that?
You wanted to die so badly?

28
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:56,336
It’s my fault.

29
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,774
Nonsense.

30
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,150
I remember everything back at Sky Hall.

31
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:02,919
- Everything at Sky Hall was my...
- It’s me!

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,119
I did everything!

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
Don’t lie to protect me.

34
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,048
Ling Long.

35
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,062
Remember.

36
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:16,080
You are unrelated to this.

37
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,974
I’m already in deep trouble.

38
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:24,159
If you get involved as
well, Master will be so sad.

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,559
No.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,205
Ling Long.

41
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,559
I came to Shaoyang when I was eight.

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,920
When I first saw you,

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,926
you welcomed me in a red dress.

44
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:37,159
You were proud like a rose.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,680
I’ve never seen
such a beautiful person before.

46
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,240
After that, I found out
that you are the sect leader’s daughter.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,959
Meanwhile, I’m just an orphan.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,239
I had sworn at that time to practice
hard because that’s the only way

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,039
I can protect you by your side.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,720
I want to see you being proud.

51
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,040
Ling Long.

52
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:05,320
Please don’t snatch my final dream away.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
No.

54
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,960
I, Zhong Min Yan,
committed a huge crime.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
I beg you, Master,

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
give me the death punishment.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,719
Father, Sixth Senior got cheated
because he values the important bonds.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,287
You can’t put all the fault on him.

59
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,801
Master, please spare Min Yan’s life.

60
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,519
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

61
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,800
Master! Please spare Sixth Senior’s life!

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Sect Leader, please spare Min Yan’s life.

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,319
Stand. All of you.

64
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,717
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

65
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:16,999
Zhong Min Yan.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,279
You were charmed by demons
and committed a grave crime.

67
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,759
You should be heavily punished.

68
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,097
Seeing that you didn’t do it on purpose,
you may escape the death punishment

69
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,240
but you will still have to be punished.

70
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,280
Someone!

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
Expel Zhong Min Yan from the sect.

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,279
Father, getting expelled
from a sect is an embarrassment for life.

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,837
Please reconsider it.

74
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,080
Xuan Ji.

75
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,119
Master is already being lenient.

76
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Don’t trouble him anymore.

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,430
Zhong Min Yan.

78
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,566
From now on, you will no
longer be a disciple of Shaoyang.

79
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,700
Hand over your name plaque.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,093
I, Zhong Min Yan, embarrassed my
master and embarrassed Shaoyang.

81
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,222
I’m handing over the Shaoyang plaque today

82
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:21,460
and not address myself
as a disciple of Shaoyang anymore.

83
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,159
Father, I have something to say.

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,421
I, Chu Ling Long, disciple of
Shaoyang, will leave Shaoyang today.

85
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:56,920
Ling Long.

86
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:59,357
You...

87
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,919
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,409
What happened today is because of me.

89
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,119
Min Yan entered Mount Buzhou to save me,
and got charmed by demons.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,920
I am ashamed to be a
disciple of Shaoyang any longer.

91
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,918
Ling Long, you were born
and raised in Shaoyang.

92
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,494
Where else can you go?

93
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,942
Take back what you said.

94
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,494
The world is so big.

95
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,686
I’ll follow you wherever you go.

96
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:24,080
Since you like to see me being proud,

97
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,280
allow me to be willful for you again.

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,879
All of you are leaving.

99
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,134
Starting today, I won’t be
a disciple of Shaoyang as well.

100
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:37,502
We will all stay together.

101
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:39,999
Xuan Ji! That’s nonsense!

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,543
You think of Shaoyang as a joke?

103
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,959
Xuan Ji, don’t cause any troubles.

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,248
I’m not.

105
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,159
We promised to always stay together.

106
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,638
What are you doing now?
If you are leaving, let’s leave together!

107
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,879
Xuan Ji.

108
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,318
I didn’t do it on impulse.
Don’t act rashly.

109
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,919
It will seem like
you are threatening Father.

110
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,537
But I don’t want to separate with you.

111
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,959
Xuan Ji.

112
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,997
We are not kids anymore.

113
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,870
We won’t be together forever.

114
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,719
If we have to separate,

115
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,600
you just have to choose
the most important person to you.

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,119
Shaoyang and Min Yan are the
most important parts of my life.

117
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,759
If I have to make a choice
now, I can only choose Min Yan.

118
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,805
If I don’t have
Shaoyang, I might still live.

119
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:32,120
But if I don’t have Min Yan,

120
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,360
I will die.

121
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,237
Why?

122
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,920
Why do you have to make this choice?

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,119
Xuan Ji, you silly child.

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,990
Not everything will go
as planned in this world.

125
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,959
We have to make different choices.

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,720
I hope that you won’t
have to make any choices in your life.

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,079
Alright. Don’t be rash.

128
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,782
I’m still your sister even
if I’m no longer a disciple of Shaoyang.

129
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,919
Min Yan will still be himself.

130
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,480
Father is old.

131
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:11,320
Can you be filial for me?

132
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,520
I, Chu Ling Long,
beg for the sect leader’s approval.

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,720
Ling Long.

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
You’ve really decided?

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,998
I’ve made my decision to leave.

136
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,359
I am unfilial.

137
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
I disappointed Shaoyang’s guidance,
and Father’s upbringing.

138
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,366
Disciples of Shaoyang,
Zhong Min Yan and Chu Ling Long,

139
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,160
violated the sect’s laws.

140
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,880
Starting today,

141
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,280
they will be expelled from Shaoyang.

142
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,319
Although both of you are
no longer disciples of Shaoyang,

143
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,920
you must remember, Shouyang Peak

144
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,760
will always be your home.

145
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
Thank you, Master.

146
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,222
Stay at the base
of the peak with Sixth Senior for now.

147
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:56,760
When Father has calmed down, I
will help you persuade him again.

148
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,117
It’s alright.

149
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,360
If you miss me, just
come and visit me.

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,894
What’s wrong?

151
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,560
You will miss me?

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,080
Xuan Ji.

153
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,080
Ever since I woke up,

154
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,039
my mind is full of
the flower demon’s memories.

155
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,942
It felt like I killed all
the person she killed.

156
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,160
It felt like her wrongdoings

157
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:28,680
were done by me.

158
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,445
Even the nasty things
that she did with Wu Tong

159
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,119
felt like I’m the one who did it.

160
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,799
I feel disgusted about myself.

161
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,960
Ling Long.

162
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,213
Those are the flower demon’s memories.

163
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,959
They are not yours.

164
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,357
You didn’t do any of those things.

165
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,374
Those were what she did.

166
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,357
You don’t have to shoulder her crimes.

167
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:56,278
But she looked exactly like me.

168
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,366
She even had half of my primordial spirit.

169
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,046
Can you say it’s totally unrelated to me?

170
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,599
That’s because
she tried to be similar to you.

171
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,838
Your primordial spirit
was seized by her as well.

172
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,317
You are the victim.

173
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,670
They were not your fault.

174
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,221
You and Sixth Senior

175
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,760
have to leave here
and stay away from these troubles.

176
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,520
You will be happy.

177
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,400
Oh. Xuan Ji.

178
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,919
This...

179
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,359
- What is this?
- This is a Memory Pearl.

180
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,436
You lost your six senses
when you were young.

181
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,980
This is an object
that recorded the times when mother

182
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:44,854
taught you about
identifying items and feelings.

183
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:49,999
After I leave, if Father feels
sad in front of Mother’s grave,

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
you have to accompany
him for me and talk to him.

185
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,160
Let’s go.

186
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,880
Sixth Senior.

187
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
Take care of my sister.

188
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,519
Let me send you off.

189
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,799
Don’t.

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,840
It’s bad if everyone comes.

191
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,480
We are leaving.

192
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,600
There are no lamps or candles here.

193
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,999
Let me get one.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320
It’s alright.

195
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,719
The moonlight is nice tonight.

196
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,440
It’s enough to light up this place.

197
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,622
How are your injuries?

198
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,080
I’m fine.

199
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,599
My house is right beside.

200
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,320
Call me if you need anything.

201
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,400
I’ll be going back.

202
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,600
Why are you so foolish?

203
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,439
You are saying that?

204
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,599
Aren’t you more foolish than me?

205
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,640
From now on, you will
become a sectless wanderer

206
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
just like me.

207
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,520
I don’t mind going anywhere

208
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,280
as long as I’m with you.

209
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:06,695
Ling Long.

210
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,560
I will never disappoint you.

211
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,159
Xuan Ji, don’t be sad.

212
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,912
Aren’t Ling Long and Min Yan fine?

213
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:35,039
It’s a good thing
to live together in peace.

214
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,120
If you miss them,
you can visit them often.

215
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:41,896
Si Feng.

216
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:45,319
I have something
I’ve been wanting to ask you.

217
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,319
If there’s one day where

218
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,919
we have to make a choice
between two important things,

219
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,520
what should we do?

220
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,511
Didn’t Ling Long say that?

221
00:18:56,512 --> 00:19:00,119
You just have to choose the
most important person to you.

222
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,816
I only know that I won’t give you up.

223
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,319
What about you?

224
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,060
I won’t give you up too.

225
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,599
Do you know?

226
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,999
I actually envy Ling Long and Min Yan.

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,560
You envy them?

228
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,399
Xuan Ji.

229
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,839
After I settle everything
in this Flower Session,

230
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,039
will you find a quiet place

231
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,280
and live a relaxed and
secluded life with me?

232
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>THE MEMORIAL TABLET OF HE DAN PING</i>

233
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,080
Father.

234
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,080
It’s both of you.

235
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:57,960
I was feeling troubled because many things

236
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,279
have happened recently.

237
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,600
That is why
I came to speak with your mother.

238
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,959
Your mother was gone
for many years in the blink of an eye.

239
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,399
Both you and Ling Long have grown up too.

240
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,279
I just hope that both of you will be safe

241
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,919
without any accidents in the future.

242
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,102
Father.

243
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,559
Don’t worry.

244
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,239
I already have the ability
to protect myself.

245
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,399
I will also take care of you and Ling Long

246
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,639
and not allow
anyone of you to be in danger.

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,399
You naughty girl.

248
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,280
You did worry me a lot in the past.

249
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,079
Unexpectedly,
after you went out to get experience,

250
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,840
you improved a lot.

251
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,119
You got the Dingkun Sword and

252
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,399
even got the Flying Snake
as you spirit beast.

253
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,551
I am very happy.

254
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:50,399
But I’m always feeling uncomfortable.

255
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
Xuan Ji.

256
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:55,799
Do you feel something
strange about yourself?

257
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,159
Oh no.

258
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,799
Did Father suspect my identity?

259
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,440
If everyone finds out I’m the God of War,

260
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,999
will they see me as a monster
and not be close to me?

261
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,050
Xuan Ji?

262
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,823
Father.

263
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:14,959
It’s a coincidence that I got
the Dingkun Sword and Flying Snake.

264
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,040
You are really
not hiding anything from me?

265
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
No.

266
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:23,159
Forget it.

267
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,951
If you won’t tell me,
I won’t force you as well.

268
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,039
I’m old.

269
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,910
I can’t stay by your side for life.

270
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:35,720
In the future, as long as Si
Feng is with you, I will be relieved.

271
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,439
Father.

272
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,960
You don’t oppose me and Si Feng anymore?

273
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,159
How should I put it?

274
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,879
After what happened with Ling
Long and Min Yan, I got over it.

275
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,759
Two people being together,

276
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,199
as long as they respect and love
each other without leaving,

277
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,119
that’s stronger than everything.

278
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,159
Si Feng is a good kid.

279
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,920
I can see that
he is loyal to you.

280
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:14,415
Si Feng.

281
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,079
I know.

282
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,519
There are many rules at Lize Palace.

283
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,135
I also know that your master
is not too satisfied with you and Xuan Ji.

284
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:28,000
Don’t worry. I will find a suitable
time to talk with your master.

285
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,360
Thank you, Sect Leader Chu.

286
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:39,199
I will never let Chu
Xuan Ji down in my life.

287
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
Don’t worry and leave Xuan Ji in my hands.

288
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,862
Are you trying to ask for a marriage now?

289
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,119
I know now is not the best time.

290
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,760
It might be a bit sudden.

291
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,200
But my feelings towards Xuan Ji
never changed at all.

292
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,600
Si Feng.

293
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,639
You brat.

294
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,800
It’s hard to keep a lady
when they grow up, right?

295
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,583
As cultivators wandering the lands,
we can’t be bothered

296
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,342
about little things.

297
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:20,799
Fine.

298
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,678
After coming back from Dianjinggu,
I will find an auspicious day

299
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,582
to help you and Ling Long get married.

300
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:33,720
From now on, I will never have
to worry about both of you again.

301
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:38,192
Father, why are you
talking about marriage...

302
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:41,064
What’s wrong? You think it’s too fast?

303
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,279
- No...
- Fine.

304
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,599
I’ll find another chance
to trouble him again. How’s that?

305
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,919
No, Sect Leader Chu.

306
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,720
I want that badly.

307
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,199
Fine.

308
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,639
Xuan Ji.

309
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,280
Have a good talk

310
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
with your mother.

311
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,279
Si Feng.

312
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,374
I told you I’ll be responsible for you.

313
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,807
I kept my promise, right?

314
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:11,759
I can only get married to you then.

315
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,399
I...

316
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,320
Give me your mother’s portrait.

317
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,559
Si Feng.

318
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,879
You once told me

319
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,199
you don’t know
where is your mother’s memorial tablet.

320
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,040
You can’t even pay respects
to her even if you wanted to.

321
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,159
Today, your mother’s
portrait is here.

322
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,079
Let’s think of this as her memorial tablet

323
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,800
and tell her this good news together.

324
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,199
Both our mothers, I got
engaged with Si Feng today.

325
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
I’m sure both of you
feel happy in your afterlife.

326
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,040
Madam Chu.

327
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:23,280
I, Yu Si Feng,

328
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,440
will definitely take good care of Xuan Ji.

329
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
Why are you smiling?

330
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,440
I’m smiling because we’ve
bowed to our parents just like that.

331
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,773
You are now my fiancÃ©e.

332
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,839
That’s not counted.

333
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,279
You just bowed in front of my mother
and you said that’s not counted?

334
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,871
My mother saw everything.

335
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:09,880
Since we went through the ritual,
where are the betrothal gifts?

336
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,279
Isn’t my hairpin enough?

337
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,359
How dare you ask for your betrothal gift?

338
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,400
Both our mothers,
you have to seek justice for me.

339
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:23,135
No way. That hairpin was given
to me by your mother, not you.

340
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,799
Fine.

341
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,039
Once I come back from Dianjinggu,

342
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,719
I will give you a grand wedding banquet.

343
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,279
No matter what you want to eat,

344
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,327
I will make them for you for a lifetime.

345
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:34,840
Is that enough?

346
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,480
That’s better.

347
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
Flying Snake?

348
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,279
Sorry to interrupt your rituals.

349
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,600
Why are you here
eating my mother’s offerings?

350
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,039
Who asked you two to be
lovey-dovey and forget about my meal?

351
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,479
Look at this stinky woman.
She’s so fierce.

352
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,680
Little Chef, if I had to say,
why don’t you reconsider it?

353
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:14,040
What are you talking about?

354
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,039
- Aunt Ying Hong.
- Xuan Ji.

355
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,886
You went to visit Ling Long and Min Yan?

356
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,839
We will depart to Dianjinggu tomorrow.

357
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,038
I went to say my goodbyes.

358
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,311
This trip to Dianjinggu is not normal.

359
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:38,159
You have to be very careful.

360
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
I understand.

361
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,760
Hold on.

362
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,710
Xuan Ji.

363
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,582
Where did you get this hairpin?

364
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,200
Hairpin?

365
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,879
What’s wrong with this hairpin?

366
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,839
This is a carving of
the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

367
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,480
Your mother was...

368
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,438
It’s fine if you forgot it.

369
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:04,159
These Rose Gold Bird Demons
are cruel and evil in nature.

370
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,319
Your father hates them.

371
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,960
Hurry and take off this hairpin.

372
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,520
This is the Rose Gold Bird?

373
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,415
Yes. It’s the Rose Gold Bird indeed.

374
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:28,199
Back then, Rose Gold Birds
were the allies of the demon clan.

375
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,631
After the Demon-Immortal War,
they escaped to the mortal realm.

376
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:32,839
Hundreds of years ago,

377
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,599
the righteous sects
worked together to surround

378
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,359
and got rid of them altogether.

379
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,040
Unfortunately, some
of them still escaped.

380
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:44,839
Aunt Ying Hong.

381
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,959
You and Ling Long said
I’ve forgotten about something.

382
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,000
What did I forget?

383
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,686
It’s better if you don’t remember.

384
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,520
You were still so young at that time.

385
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:57,430
Xuan Ji, all these years,

386
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:00,399
we’ve been looking for
the whereabouts of the demon clan.

387
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,055
Tell me.
Where did you get this hairpin?

388
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:05,760
Maybe we can find some clues here.

389
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,479
This hairpin was a gift
from my father to my mother.

390
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,200
I’m giving it to you now.

391
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,720
Si Feng, this...

392
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,999
This hairpin is too precious.

393
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,919
You should keep it well.
How can you give it to me?

394
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,560
I gave it to you

395
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,279
because it’s important.

396
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,480
I hope that
you can understand my feelings.

397
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,640
This...

398
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,983
I bought this hairpin
when I was at Qingmu Town.

399
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:42,839
No matter what, you better
not wear this hairpin anymore

400
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,634
in case your father feels sad
when he sees it.

401
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,719
Xuan Ji, where did you
get this hairpin?

402
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,599
This is a carving of
the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

403
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,239
Your mother was...

404
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,679
It’s fine if you forgot it.

405
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,999
These Rose Gold Bird Demons
are cruel and evil in nature.

406
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Your father hates them.

407
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,239
You better not
wear this hairpin anymore

408
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,256
in case your father feels sad
when he sees it.

409
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Xuan Ji.

410
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
Si Feng.

411
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,054
Si Feng.

412
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,640
You were spacing out.
What were you thinking about?

413
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,159
I met Aunt Ying Hong just now.

414
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,351
I have a feeling that
she is hiding something from me.

415
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:48,719
Also, Ling Long also wanted to tell
me something about my childhood.

416
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,920
She even gave me a Memory Pearl.

417
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:55,799
Si Feng.

418
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,254
Can you watch it with me?

419
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,800
Sure. I’m here, don’t be afraid.

420
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
Hurry up.

421
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,080
Hurry up.

422
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,631
Xuan Ji.

423
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,600
Can you see the faraway mountains?

424
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:35,799
Remember.

425
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,239
Mountains are green.

426
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,640
I understand.

427
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,799
Look at that flower.

428
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,199
- Flowers are white.
- I understand.

429
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,360
Mother, what color do you like?

430
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,136
I like blue color.

431
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:53,600
- Can you remember it?
- I remember.

432
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,360
Rose Gold Bird! Xuan Ji!

433
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,800
Mother!

434
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
I remember now.

435
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,239
I remember everything.

436
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,656
It’s the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

437
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:27,000
Si Feng! Rose Gold Bird Demon
killed my mother!

438
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Xuan Ji.

439
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,160
I’m sure

440
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,528
there’s a misunderstanding.

441
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,080
How could it be?

442
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,252
I remember now.

443
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,559
When I was five,

444
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,119
I saw my mother getting killed by
Rose Gold Bird Demon with my eyes.

445
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,607
Although I don’t know
what was pain at that time,

446
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:52,391
I couldn’t eat, drink
or sleep after that day.

447
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:56,495
I fainted one day and forgot
everything when I woke up.

448
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:59,295
When I saw the Memory Pearl, I...

449
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:00,847
I remember everything.

450
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,039
My mother was really killed
by the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

451
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,119
No wonder Aunt Ying Hong had a
big reaction when she saw the hairpin.

452
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,359
Can you tell me how
your father got this hairpin?

453
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,600
Maybe I can find some clues.

454
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:19,719
Xuan Ji.

455
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,160
I only know that this hairpin
was given to me by my mother.

456
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,200
But in this world, not all
Rose Gold Bird are bad.

457
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,040
That might be true.

458
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,423
But Rose Gold Bird Demon killing
my mother is the undeniable truth.

459
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:43,239
This time, I must get
Sky Hall’s demon at Dianjinggu

460
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,399
and ask them about
the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

461
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,440
I have to find the culprit
and avenge my mother.

462
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,040
Fine.

463
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,655
Master.

464
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:20,120
You should’ve heard
what Chu Xuan Ji said just now, right?

465
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,415
It’s still not confirmed yet.

466
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,719
Silver Snake.

467
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,287
Help me investigate this.

468
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:31,920
What if I find out
everything is true?

469
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,200
If that is true,

470
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,000
I will help Xuan Ji in her revenge.

471
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:41,120
But this is unrelated to other tribes.

472
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,239
I believe in Xuan Ji.

473
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,079
She is someone who knows
what’s right and what’s wrong.

474
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,199
Master.

475
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,840
Don’t be foolish.

476
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:53,318
Although I don’t agree with
you being with her, if you insist

477
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,679
and wouldn’t leave her,

478
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,399
I think it’s better
to get back the Lugong puzzle.

479
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,480
It’s still not too late
before she solves it.

480
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,519
I get it.

481
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,727
I know you don’t want to hide it from her.

482
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:09,200
But now you have this thing in between,

483
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:13,079
do you think it’s wise
to tell her your real identity?

484
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,726
That’s enough.

485
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:16,200
You may leave.

486
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,680
Master.

487
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,119
I’m just afraid that you fell for
her but ended up getting nothing

488
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,320
and fall to the Loveless Curse in the end.

489
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,759
Sect Leader, are you still worried

490
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,800
about finding the spy from Sky Hall?

491
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,599
Yes.

492
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,215
There’ll be a fierce battle
in the Flower Session at Dianjinggu.

493
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:03,695
If we can’t uncover the spy from Sky Hall,

494
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,919
there’s a big chance
for them to work together

495
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,919
and steal the last spirit key.

496
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,807
Don’t worry, Sect Leader.
I have an idea.

497
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:12,999
The demon who fought me at Mount Buzhou

498
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,054
extinguished one of
Xuan Ji and the group’s Birth Candles.

499
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:18,039
He left a flaw there.

500
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,847
Look.

501
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,015
This bottle holds

502
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:23,879
the merman blood I went
to get from Donghai just now.

503
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,919
Once a merman’s blood leaves its body,

504
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,559
it will become colorless and scentless.

505
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,399
As long as it touches Merman’s Tear,

506
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,239
it will regain
its blood characteristics and turn red.

507
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,439
The demon extinguished
one of the Birth Candles.

508
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,534
His hands will have Merman’s Tear on them.

509
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:40,559
Luckily, Merman’s Tear won’t disappear
once it’s been touched.

510
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,279
You mean you want to use the
merman blood to find out who is the spy?

511
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,839
That’s right.

512
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,119
When the Demon Whip
was destroyed by Xuan Ji,

513
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,079
there were 12 elders there.

514
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,999
Why don’t we use the merman blood
to test every one of them?

515
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,070
If anyone’s hand can change
the color of the merman’s blood,

516
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:00,071
that person will be
the spy we are looking for.

517
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,239
However, we have
to do it in Dianjinggu.

518
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,159
We still need
Valley Master Rong’s cooperation.

519
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,799
Valley Master Rong was there as well.

520
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,486
Your plan won’t work if he is the spy.

521
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:15,766
Don’t worry.

522
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:19,359
When I came back from Donghai,
I went to Dianjinggu specially

523
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,479
to test Valley Master Rong
with the merman’s blood.

524
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,239
He isn’t the person we are looking for.

525
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,839
He has also promised
to cooperate with our plan.

526
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,479
Great.

527
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,600
We have to find the spy of
the demon clan no matter what.

528
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,000
My lord.

529
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,999
I said you are
just a dog that I picked up.

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,360
Do you remember?

531
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,199
It was etched in my mind.

532
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,120
- I dare not forget.
- That’s great.

533
00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:20,880
Come.

534
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,240
Let me see which hand you used

535
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,320
to steal my Dragon Seal.

536
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,920
I have to reward you.

537
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,295
My lord, no.

538
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:33,560
Don’t, my lord.

539
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,320
It’s this hand

540
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,439
- or this?
- My lord.

541
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
No.

542
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:46,520
No, my lord.

543
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,959
You fool!

544
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,215
This hand is dismembered

545
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:01,759
with my Reverse Pulse Smoke.
It will not heal.

546
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,760
You have two hours to live
before your blood runs dry.

547
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,159
My lord!

548
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,759
I know my crimes cannot be forgiven,

549
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,936
but Sky Hall needs people at this time.

550
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,159
I can still contribute to you, my lord.

551
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
I will be loyal in the future.

552
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,800
How can a dog who bit his master

553
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,999
be of use to me?

554
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,719
My lord.

555
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,104
Aren’t you planning to hit Dianjinggu?

556
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,439
Diangjinggu is famous for its defenses.

557
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,959
It’s even full of traps in the valley.

558
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,639
You will suffer heavy casualties
if you don’t know the area.

559
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,320
Are you saying
you have a way to disarm the traps?

560
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:59,247
I used to be a
disciple of Dianjinggu.

561
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:02,071
I saw the defense mechanism map
of Dianjinggu.

562
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:03,999
Only the Valley Master has the map.

563
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,999
He will never imagine that
someone else has seen it before.

564
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,999
If you can spare my life, I
can guarantee that Sky Hall

565
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
will be able to infiltrate
every part of Dianjinggu.

566
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:20,479
My lord.

567
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,599
I did it once so I
dare not do it again.

568
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,760
Please give me a chance.

569
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,680
What a pity to kill

570
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,400
a dog that is good at biting.

571
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,240
But I’m still angry at you.

572
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,680
Alright.

573
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,519
If you can save yourself, I
will give you another chance.

574
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,920
Although the wound cannot heal
by itself, it’s not totally impossible.

575
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,880
Here’s a fire barrel.

576
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,440
If you can burn your wound

577
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,240
with this barrel of fire,

578
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,280
your bleeding will stop.

579
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,600
Do you want to give it a try?

580
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,855
I appreciate your attitude
of being cruel to others

581
00:41:44,856 --> 00:41:47,047
and crueler to your own.

582
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:49,480
I will give you another chance.

583
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,576
You have to remember.

584
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,440
If you have other ideas,

585
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,760
I will have tons of ways to torture you.

586
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,240
Vice Palace Lord.

587
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,479
What’s wrong?

588
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
I was ordered to find the stalactite

589
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,919
that grows every 3,000 years
in Dianjinggu by the Palace Lord.

590
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,335
I’ve finally found it recently.

591
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,439
I was supposed to report to the
Palace Lord but I couldn’t find him.

592
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,160
The Palace Lord is missing?

593
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:37,920
- I understand. You may leave.
- Yes.

594
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,919
That lunatic.

595
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,680
Besides there,

596
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:47,600
where else will he be?

597
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:01,840
Hao Feng.

598
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,520
After lying here for so many years,

599
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:08,160
it’s time to wake up.

600
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,807
Spring is here.

601
00:43:10,808 --> 00:43:15,440
I’ve planted many peach
blossoms in Lize Palace.

602
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,599
You will be very happy when you

603
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,800
see something familiar when you wake up.

604
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,159
Senior.

605
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,439
You’ve been speaking to a corpse
for more than 20 years.

606
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,080
What’s the point?

607
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,423
Who let you in?

608
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:35,679
If the disciples find out that
the Palace Lord of Lize Palace

609
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,279
hides a female corpse in the
inner hall, what will they think?

610
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,879
Shut up! Get lost!

611
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,959
Don’t be angry, Senior.

612
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,999
I’m here to give you a good news.

613
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,340
The stalactites in Dianjinggu have grown.

614
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,916
The stalactites

615
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,143
have really grown?

616
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:56,839
If you can get the stalactites
at the Flower session,

617
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,079
your Hao Feng will be revived.

618
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,640
She will no longer be an ice-cold corpse.

619
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,839
Hao Feng.

620
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,479
You hear that?

621
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,375
I’ve been waiting
so many years for this moment.

622
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:14,199
Once I kill all those
righteous sects that killed you

623
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,440
and get the stalactites,
we will be reunited.

624
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:20,367
Hao Feng.

625
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:22,440
Be patient and wait a few more days.

626
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:27,880
I will definitely give you a hand.

627
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:31,559
Give me a hand?

628
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,200
Those are some glorified words.

629
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:36,319
Don’t think that

630
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,799
I don’t know the underhanded things
that you did behind my back.

631
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,919
You are just trying
to use me and get the spirit key.

632
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,520
Am I right?

633
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,760
Getting straight to the point.

634
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,871
That’s good.

635
00:44:49,872 --> 00:44:53,279
Let’s work together
at Dianjinggu’s Flower Session.

636
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,679
You’ll get your stalactites
while I get my spirit key.

637
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,080
Killing two birds with one stone.

638
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,279
I don’t know what
you are trying to do,

639
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,040
but I’m just trying to save my Hao Feng.

640
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,080
The rest,

641
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I’ll leave it up to you.

642
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,239
Senior.

643
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,600
We are riding on the same boat.

644
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,680
I can’t wait for the Flower Session.

645
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,023
Stinky woman, didn’t you sleep well?

646
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:46,719
Flying Snake, keep your eyes peeled
once we reach Dianjinggu.

647
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,440
You can’t miss out any demon, understand?
