1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,319
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,574
<i>EPISODE 57</i>

3
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,719
I didn’t expect you to be here.

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,861
Xi Xuan.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,999
You always go against me no matter
if you’re in Heaven or Earth, huh?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,570
Thanks to you, I’ve remembered everything.

7
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:57,213
King Bailing, are you sure you did
everything for the sake of the world?

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,930
Do you have no regrets towards
God of War, Xuan Ji, and Rahu Ketu?

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,959
Under what identity are you asking that?

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,770
Are you Xi Xuan, the son of Jade Emperor?

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,370
Or are you the demon under
the command of Rahu Ketu?

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,340
Oh, I almost forgot.

13
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,378
Lord Xi Xuan, your mother was
the princess of the demon clan.

14
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,269
The three realms were peaceful
10,000 years ago.

15
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,063
When the demon clan
was under the rule of our realm,

16
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:34,314
the demon king presented his daughter to
our Jade Emperor as a show of good faith.

17
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,273
The Jade Emperor sees all being as equal.

18
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,569
He treated you and your mother well too.

19
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,060
But demons were born to be betrayers!

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,915
After the Asura clan grew in strength,

21
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,166
the demon king wanted to
establish their own kingdom.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,559
And their princess abandoned

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,847
her identity as the Jade Emperor’s consort
and returned to support them.

24
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,141
When the demon army was attacking us,

25
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,599
you knew how to hide in order
to avoid any implications.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,108
But in the end,

27
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:04,719
you gave up your heavenly rank
because of Star of Mosha.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,488
What?

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,879
Now, you’re siding with the
demon clan to question the heavens?

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,799
All beings in the three realms are equal.

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,659
Today, we shall discuss
the matter at hand.

32
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,860
I just wanted to ask you this.

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,039
You tricked Rahu Ketu into drinking
the drugged wine and extracted his soul.

34
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,679
You turned him into the God of War
and commanded him to slay his own kin.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,850
And now, you won’t even give him
a chance to seek justice?

36
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,639
I had no choice under the circumstances.

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,919
I extracted his soul because I didn’t want
all beings to suffer from another war.

38
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,250
I’m giving him
a chance to do good as well.

39
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:49,075
It was I who protected
his primordial spirit.

40
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:52,359
I’ve never mistreated her
when she was the God of War.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,319
And I tried my best to compensate her.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,639
I gave her the highest rank and honor.

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,679
When she was undergoing her tribulations,

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,632
I even descended to the mortal realm
in order to guide her.

45
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,628
I don’t owe her anything!

46
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,159
A chance for her to do good?

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,580
You’re just controlling her.

48
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:11,388
You’re just trying to make her your puppet

49
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,479
in order to protect your position
in the heavens.

50
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,549
You did everything

51
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,648
not because you wanted to
compensate Rahu Ketu.

52
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,082
You did them to ease your conscience.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,730
Lord Xi Xuan, your love is pure indeed.

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,719
You sacrifice everything for love.

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,199
You even feel sorry for Rahu Ketu.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,879
But you better be clear!

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,959
She’s no longer Chu Xuan Ji!

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,490
Xuan Ji still exists.

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,118
Rahu Ketu and Xuan Ji
exist in the same body.

60
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,367
Xuan Ji will return if Rahu Ketu
puts down his hatred.

61
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,621
You fell in love with Xuan Ji
while you were a human too.

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,090
Why are you trying to kill her
when there’s a chance to save her?

63
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,046
Fell in love?

64
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:59,035
When did I fall in love?

65
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:03,359
I’m doing all this in order
to protect the three realms!

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,855
Fine.

67
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:07,906
You said that you’re doing this
in order to protect the three realms.

68
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,477
Let’s make a bet then.

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,942
I believe Rahu Ketu won’t become
the merciless demon

70
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,993
who destroys everything.

71
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,653
What a joke!

72
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,064
I want to see

73
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,200
where your confidence came from.

74
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,170
Rahu Ketu had only wanted to
vent out his anger.

75
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,648
He wants justice to be served.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,512
But you insist on saying that he was
going to slaughter people.

77
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,129
And you slaughter him in advance.

78
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,399
That’s why his hatred grew.

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,330
If you can resolve this feud

80
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,770
and acquire his forgiveness,
we can avoid this calamity.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,039
Are you willing to let Rahu Ketu

82
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,616
meet you alone for the sake
of the three realms?

83
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,537
So that you two can resolve
the feud on your own?

84
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:59,016
What if my assumption
was correct all along?

85
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:03,698
What if Rahu Ketu came to
massacre everyone in the heavens?

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,109
If that’s the case, I will lose the bet.

87
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,817
I will perish together with
him in the Demon Citadel.

88
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:14,159
But if I win the
bet, I only hope that

89
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,635
you can make an official apology
to Rahu Ketu

90
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,486
for the wrongs you’ve done against him.

91
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,372
And let him go

92
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,799
from then onward.

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,214
No matter if he’s Rahu Ketu or Xuan Ji,

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,678
you should never
appear in their lives again.

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,501
Fine.

96
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,348
Since you’re sacrificing yourself
for the bet,

97
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,023
I’ll accept it.

98
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,961
But you better remember your words.

99
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:51,012
If Rahu Ketu does come
to massacre our people,

100
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,490
you better remember your words.

101
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,734
You shouldn’t forget this as well.

102
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:58,241
If Rahu Ketu does not
intend to hurt anyone,

103
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:01,172
the heavens
mustn’t hurt him as well.

104
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,701
Bring him here.

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,313
Hurry.

106
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,603
Hurry.

107
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,291
Everyone, hurry up!

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,479
- Everyone, hurry up.
- Master.

109
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,919
Bring them to the mountains
and help them settle down.

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,985
Yes.

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,150
Uncle He Yang and Elder Ying Hong

112
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,159
have contacted Lord Dong Fang
and Valley Master Rong.

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,639
They’re on the way here
with other refugees.

114
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,228
Go and meet them.

115
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:58,366
Yes.

116
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,879
- Min Xing.
- Master.

117
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,982
Go back and check if there
are any remaining refugees.

118
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,450
If you find them, bring them here.

119
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,659
Yes, Master.

120
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,118
Sect Leader Chu, we
found some refugees.

121
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,569
We’ve brought them here.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,599
Is that so? Thank you for the trouble.

123
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,919
Is Rahu Ketu going to destroy everything?

124
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,399
Will Xuan Ji become a demon
and never return?

125
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,399
That won’t be. Xuan Ji hasn’t disappear.
I’m sure she’s still around.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,399
If not, Rahu Ketu wouldn’t give us

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,970
the Core Fire and protect us
from the disaster.

128
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,345
Little Phoenix?

129
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,056
Little Phoenix!

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,199
Si Feng, were you okay
in the Demon Citadel?

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,159
We couldn’t find you when we went there.

132
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,890
- We were worried.
- I’m fine.

133
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,918
It’s just that I haven’t been able to
bring Xuan Ji back yet.

134
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,279
How’s Xuan Ji then?
Did she reappear?

135
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,647
Did she remember us?

136
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:05,745
Ling Long, I’m sure Si Feng
has something important to tell us.

137
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,047
Let’s listen to him for now.

138
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,066
I did think of a solution
to bring her back.

139
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,367
What solution?

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,500
Tell us then.

141
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,963
But it’s risky. I need your help.

142
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:21,479
We’ll do anything as long as
we can bring back Xuan Ji.

143
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,000
I’ve persuaded King Bailing
to meet Rahu Ketu.

144
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,399
I hope they can resolve their feud.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,465
If King Bailing is willing to
let Rahu Ketu seek justice,

146
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,638
our situation will change.

147
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,239
But he’s King Bailing, you know?
I don’t think he will give in this easily.

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,980
That’s what I’m worried about.

149
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:42,237
We can only bring back Xuan Ji if
we can resolve Rahu Ketu’s hatred.

150
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,159
Only then, all beings can avoid
this calamity.

151
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,939
But in the event that
King Bailing goes back on his words,

152
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,663
only the Jade Emperor
can help us out in that situation.

153
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,875
Are you asking us to
seek the Jade Emperor?

154
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,319
Yes.

155
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,086
Jade Emperor is in Mount Kunlun.

156
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,639
It’s a forbidden ground.

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,053
It’s hard for you
to make it there by yourselves.

158
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,464
You should find Wu Zhi Qi first.

159
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:02,745
I’m sure he has a way
to bring you there.

160
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,679
Wu Zhi Qi?

161
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,044
Wu Zhi Qi has been in low spirits
ever since Purple Fox died.

162
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,459
He spends his days doing nothing
before her grave.

163
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,741
- I’m afraid he...
- He will agree.

164
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,219
I’m just worried about the Jade Emperor.

165
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,786
He was formed by Heaven’s will.

166
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:23,090
I’m afraid he won’t interfere
with the feud between them.

167
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,970
What should we do then?

168
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,401
If so, you should tell him...

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,433
You’re back?

170
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,090
Did Bailing make things difficult for you?

171
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,550
You’re not cold-blooded indeed.

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,279
I’m just concerned about the way

173
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,010
that coward would treat my subordinate.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,330
Bailing has agreed to see you.

175
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,330
That coward actually agreed?

176
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,730
Good.

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,930
It’s been 1,000 years.

178
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,600
I want to see how
Bailing is going to face me.

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,359
I’ll help you cross
the Sea of Life and Death.

180
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,650
But you need to promise me this.

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,279
This time, you’re going there
to resolve your feud with him.

182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,439
You mustn’t harm anyone there.

183
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,755
I won’t harm anyone as long
as that coward keeps his words.

184
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,443
<i>GRAVE OF PURPLE FOX</i>

185
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,001
Wu Zhi Qi.

186
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,625
Little Fox,

187
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,382
your friends are here to visit you.

188
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,625
You loved it when people
come to visit you, right?

189
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,436
Now, we can drink to our heart’s content.

190
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,199
Stop drinking.

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,770
Purple Fox wouldn’t be happy
if she sees you in this state.

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,515
See me in what state?

193
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,915
In the past, Little Fox wanted me

194
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:41,566
to accompany her every day.

195
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,930
Now, I’m by her side every day.

196
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,301
I’m sure she’s happy.

197
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,330
Wu Zhi Qi, let’s meet Jade Emperor
in Mount Kunlun together.

198
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,855
I’m not going.

199
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,959
There’s no wine in Mount Kunlun.

200
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,490
Little Fox isn’t there either.

201
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,282
It’s boring.

202
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,679
Rahu Ketu and King Bailing
will fight each other soon.

203
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,891
If they do fight each other,
only the Jade Emperor can stop them.

204
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:13,815
We really need you.

205
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,982
They can fight all they want.

206
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,353
It has nothing to do with me.

207
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,824
Now, I don’t care about anything.

208
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:28,758
Fine.

209
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,834
You want to drink?

210
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,064
I’ll drink with you.

211
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,981
But, I don’t know if we still
have a chance to drink after this.

212
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,810
If so, we should cherish
our remaining time.

213
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,565
Old Wu, you should know this well.

214
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,361
King Bailing is forcing Rahu Ketu
into a corner.

215
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:06,893
If he forces Rahu Ketu
to overturn the Transcendent Furnace,

216
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:08,828
the Heaven Fire will descend

217
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,079
and everything in the three realms
will disappear.

218
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:15,810
By then, not only will
Purple Fox’s grave disappear,

219
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,249
your memories with her

220
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:22,610
that you wanted to protect
will disappear as well.

221
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,322
Do you really want that to happen?

222
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,765
As friends, we won’t force
you to make decisions.

223
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,914
We just hope that you can
consider this with care.

224
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:46,064
Tomorrow, we’ll depart for Mount Kunlun.

225
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,850
We’ll wait for you at Mount Shaoyang.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,370
Even if you don’t come,

227
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,280
we will go there by ourselves.

228
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,050
Let me end this once and for all.

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,713
Let’s go.

230
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,690
Demon Lord, you mustn’t!

231
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,519
Please wait for me to capture
the Rose Gold Birds before you go!

232
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,770
Do you think I will go back on my words
like that coward, Bailing?

233
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,014
Stay here.

234
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,130
If that coward goes back on his words,

235
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,552
I’ll wreak havoc in the heavens.

236
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,343
Yu Si Feng.

237
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,529
Let’s go.

238
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,210
Right Lieutenant, what should we do now?

239
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,370
We’ll stay here.

240
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,176
Observe the heavens closely.

241
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,372
Yes.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,115
It’s 7 am already. Just forget him.

243
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,364
Let’s depart now.

244
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,051
Didn’t you prepare some wine
for me since you wanted me

245
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,492
to follow your trip?

246
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,497
Seems like Si Feng’s advice
was useful indeed.

247
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,839
The thing I regret the most in the world

248
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,920
is knowing Xuan Ji and Si Feng,
the two troublemakers.

249
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,394
I have no choice.

250
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,639
I can’t bear to leave them alone.

251
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,707
We’re just trying to find
the Jade Emperor at Mount Kunlun, right?

252
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,946
Let’s go.

253
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,765
Who’s there?

254
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,854
- Ruo Yu?
- Min Yan.

255
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,425
Why did you follow us?

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,479
I want to go to the heavens as well.

257
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,279
Please bring me along.

258
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,524
What? Are you trying to harm us again?

259
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,765
I...

260
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,105
I know I have let you down
on many occasions.

261
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,756
I know that I don’t deserve
your forgiveness.

262
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,130
But I promised Silver Snake that
I’ll protect Si Feng.

263
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,799
I’m sure I can be of use.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,886
I want to try my best
to atone for my sins.

265
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,879
Please.

266
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,250
Get up now.

267
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,690
Kid, it’s not that easy
to atone for your sins.

268
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,239
Just ignore him. Let’s go.

269
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,738
Ruo Yu, if you really want
to help, you can follow us.

270
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,439
We have an appointment with King Bailing.

271
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,999
We don’t wish to hurt innocent people.

272
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,290
King Bailing has been waiting for you two.
Please.

273
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,219
- We’re here.
- Is this Mount Kunlun?

274
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,176
The Jade Emperor’s shelter
in the mortal realm?

275
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,679
No.

276
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,639
We have to get through Kaiming Gate
before we reach Mount Kunlun.

277
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,569
We have no time to waste. Let’s go.

278
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,999
Wait. Don’t rush.

279
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,410
It isn’t that easy for you
to approach Mount Kunlun.

280
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,001
You see the stillwater
surrounding this area?

281
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,522
Ordinary people can’t cross the river.

282
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,559
After we pass this,
we still have Hell Flame to get through.

283
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,199
Mortals will turn into ashes
if they touch the flame.

284
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,359
After that, we still have
the Raging Gale Formation.

285
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,681
Even tough animals like elephants

286
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,919
will be torn into pieces
when they enter the formation.

287
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,519
Of course, these obstacles
are nothing to me.

288
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,490
But for mortals like you,

289
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:11,799
I’m afraid it’s impossible to get through.

290
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,992
How can we reach Kaiming Gate then?

291
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,399
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

292
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,890
Why should we pass through the obstacles

293
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,999
when there’s an alternate route?

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,848
You know quite a lot.

295
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,799
Of course. I’ve studied every path
that could reach the heavens

296
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,170
when I first stole the celestial eye.

297
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,276
We can reach Kaiming Gate
by climbing the southern cliff.

298
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,053
Although you’re right, we still
need to cross the stillwater river.

299
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,744
If we want to reach the southern cliff.

300
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:41,807
We can’t fly over there.

301
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,866
- Let’s hurry over there then.
- Wait!

302
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,637
Can you stop rushing?

303
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,464
Look.

304
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,505
Even a leaf can’t float on it.

305
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,836
How do we cross this river?

306
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,139
What are you trying to do?

307
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,408
Ordinary things can’t float on stillwater.

308
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,079
There’s only one exception. The feathers
of a Rose Gold Bird.

309
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,976
Because their feathers are formed
by the golden ray of sun.

310
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:26,307
That’s why they can float on stillwater.

311
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,770
So, you have to suffer for a bit.

312
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,239
We need your feathers to make a boat.

313
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,923
We can cross after that. Come on.

314
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,959
Just come.

315
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,799
No way! I’ll be bald by then!

316
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,519
- Come, don’t run!
- No way!

317
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,070
It’ll be over in a moment. It won’t hurt.

318
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,399
Let me do it.

319
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,479
It did work.

320
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,596
Their feathers do float on stillwater.

321
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,090
We owe you a favor this time.

322
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,279
Why is it so quiet?

323
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:20,253
There are no towns or villages here.

324
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:22,422
Other beings can’t cross the river too.

325
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,660
Of course it’s quiet.

326
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,019
Look! What’s that?

327
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:38,278
This is bad. It’s the
Ten Sorcerers of Kunlun.

328
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,811
Are they powerful?

329
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:42,400
They protect the borders of Mount Kunlun.

330
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:43,901
If I’m not mistaken,

331
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:47,191
- he’s Wu Lv.
- Demons,

332
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,366
how dare you show yourself
in Mount Kunlun?

333
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,799
Get to the shore. We’re on stillwater.

334
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,440
We’re at a disadvantage if we fight here.

335
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,433
You want to escape?

336
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,113
The heavenly navy!

337
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,775
Get to the shore!

338
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,902
What is this?

339
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,644
Let me out!

340
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,006
Old guy, you should care
for your own army.

341
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,617
You don’t need to worry
about what’s happening on the shore.

342
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,669
Old Wu, let me out!

343
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,960
Let me out!

344
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,959
What’s this scent?

345
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,039
What scent? I don’t smell anything.

346
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,730
Just ignore that for now!
Come and release me!

347
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,221
Why are you two in a daze?

348
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,587
Can’t you hear me?

349
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,558
Let me out!

350
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,279
Brother, you’re back?

351
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,239
Come, drink a jar with me.
Let’s get drunk.

352
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,802
One jar? That’s not enough!
We need ten jars! Come!

353
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,519
We need at least ten rounds!

354
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,879
Come!

355
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,960
Stupid Monkey.

356
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,607
- Little Fox?
- Stupid Monkey.

357
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:03,940
You’re drinking so much.

358
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:06,639
- Did you forget about our vineyard?
- Vineyard?

359
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,441
The vineyard where
we first met each other.

360
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:13,263
There are so many grapes
in the vineyard right now.

361
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,679
Stop drinking.
Let’s harvest some grapes.

362
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,439
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

363
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,292
I’ll leave for a moment.
You continue.

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,215
Ruo Yu.

365
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,675
Yan Ran?

366
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:39,938
Isn’t this

367
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,108
your favorite food?

368
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,519
I know you treated me well in the past.

369
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,102
I was too willful and too fierce
in the past.

370
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:52,212
I won’t act like that

371
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,123
again.

372
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,031
Ruo Yu!

373
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,890
Do you want to save your sister?

374
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,677
If you want to, you should obey me!

375
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:08,151
Ruo Xue!

376
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:09,523
Don’t hurt my sister!

377
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,356
Ruo Yu! Save me!

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,250
Ruo Yu! Save me!

379
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,101
How dare you betray me!

380
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,210
I’ll kill your loved ones
right in front of your eyes!

381
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,330
This is bad!
They’re caught in an illusion!

382
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,010
Ling Long, try to wake them up!

383
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,743
Let’s go!

384
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,650
Ruo Yu, wake up!

385
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,626
Ruo Yu!

386
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:04,557
Wu Zhi Qi, what’s wrong with you?

387
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,077
Wu Zhi Qi, wake up!

388
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:07,301
Stop advancing!

389
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,681
Stop advancing!

390
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:12,426
Wu Peng?

391
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:13,486
This is bad!

392
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,715
It’s you? You must be the one
behind the illusion!

393
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:21,839
The illusion has everything you need.

394
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,719
You can have anything
you desire in the illusion.

395
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,159
Isn’t that great?

396
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,176
Come, tell me.

397
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:30,507
Tell me your desires.

398
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,107
I want...

399
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,719
- I want...
- Ling Long!

400
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,207
Wu Peng is one of the Ten Sorcerers!

401
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,639
Snap out of it!

402
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,921
She’s trying to trick you!
Don’t fall for it!

403
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,490
Don’t try to trick me!

404
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,701
Wake them up right now!

405
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,201
Why should I?

406
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,448
Reality is too harsh.

407
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:53,090
You like to escape reality, right?

408
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,321
Fine!

409
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:57,092
If you don’t wake them up,

410
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,435
I’ll gorge your eyes out.

411
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:03,229
And sever your head from your neck.

412
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,600
I’ll show you no mercy!

413
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,397
Please don’t gorge my eyes out!

414
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:08,588
I’ll wake them up!

415
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,567
Hurry!

416
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,440
Ruo Yu!

417
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,705
- Min Yan!
- Let’s go!

418
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,488
This... This is impossible!

419
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,144
No weapon should be able to
break through my barrier!

420
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,631
Why is that impossible?

421
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,039
Listen up.

422
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,318
It’s been a long time since
I’ve used my Finger of Power.

423
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,148
What a coincidence.
I’ll try it out on you then!

424
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,519
I’ll show you how powerful I am!

425
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,238
- Ling Long, are you okay?
- I’m okay.

426
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,989
We’re the Ten Sorcerers of Kunlun!

427
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,679
How dare you humiliate us like this!

428
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,321
We will surely report this
to the Jade Emperor!

429
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:47,684
Listen up. I sat on his throne before.

430
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,364
Do you think I’m afraid of you?

431
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,735
You should stay in the water!

432
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,159
Old Wu! Let me out!

433
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,490
This is great! I have never
felt better being a demon!

434
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,150
Can’t you be more gentle?

435
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,439
The cliff is extremely slippery.
How could we climb it?

436
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,399
We have no other choice.
We can only climb it.

437
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,079
Why can’t we use our powers?

438
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,239
The heavens loves to
mystify things.

439
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,450
If we use our powers, we won’t be able to
see Kaiming Gate.

440
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,479
The cliff is alive.

441
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,326
Your daggers will disappear
after a short while.

442
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:45,559
So, you better be careful.

443
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,898
I heard that

444
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,759
there’s a Kaiming Beast
with nine heads guarding the gate.

445
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,093
It’s hard to deal with.

446
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:53,381
I think we should be careful.

447
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:56,237
We need to go no matter what.

448
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,599
Are you okay?

449
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,695
I’m fine.

450
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,290
I’m too old for this!

451
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,943
Your body is weak indeed.

452
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:33,875
Min Yan.

453
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,410
I’ve committed so many crimes in the past.

454
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:40,439
I don’t deserve your help.

455
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,090
Si Feng told me about your sister.

456
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,890
Although I still can’t forgive you,

457
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,410
I can’t just let you die
while I do nothing.

458
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,845
Min Yan,

459
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,799
I’m sorry.

460
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,071
You took the risk in order to
save Si Feng and Xuan Ji.

461
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:04,756
Since everyone is trying their best
to help them,

462
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,966
I’ll accept your apology for now.

463
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,687
Come.

464
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:11,999
Have some food.

465
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,839
Recover your energy. Here.

466
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,610
You even brought this?

467
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,084
- Nine heads?
- Is this the Kaiming Beast?

468
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,311
So delicious.

469
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:46,242
- Do you want to eat them?
- Yes!

470
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,066
I won’t give you any of them!

471
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,818
We don’t have much. You should share.

472
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,385
So delicious! Give us more!

473
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,295
I guess you aren’t full yet.

474
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,714
I have some wine.

475
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:26,941
Here.

476
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,975
What are you doing?

477
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,679
This is bad.
We own them a favor now.

478
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,599
We actually ate their food
without knowing their goals.

479
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,175
Big Brother, you ate the most, you know?

480
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,066
Aren’t you embarrassed?

481
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,253
Second Brother ate the most!

482
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,148
Who are you? Why are
you approaching Mount Kunlun?

483
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,078
We just passed by the area.

484
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,068
We wanted to have a snack
since we were hungry.

485
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:29,439
But you took it all.

486
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,731
Tell me, what should we do?

487
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:31,955
What should we do now?

488
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,646
Don’t bother me because of
trivial matters like these!

489
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,159
You can handle this.

490
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,330
Be quiet! I’m going to meditate.

491
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,376
Don’t cry. You drank the least.

492
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,492
We won’t blame you.

493
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,348
I still have some wine.
Do you want to drink?

494
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,279
Don’t tell Big Brother about this.

495
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,770
Don’t worry. We won’t tell him.

496
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,202
You’re amazing!
You finished it in one gulp!

497
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:18,838
More!

498
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,481
Here.

499
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,679
I will never be drunk!

500
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,243
A few jars of wine
won’t do anything to me!

501
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,141
But I think you’re drunk.

502
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,325
I thought you were the guardian
of the gate?

503
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,639
Isn’t it too much if you get drunk?

504
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,799
It’s fine! I won’t let anyone pass!

505
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,643
Here’s a secret.

506
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:43,758
Our tail is the key to unlocking
Kaiming Gate.

507
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:47,639
I’ll show you how to unlock it so
that you can broaden your horizon.

508
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,370
And know that ordinary people
can’t enter Mount Kunlun.

509
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,519
It’s that amazing? Show it to us

510
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,210
so that we may sing your praise
to the people below.

511
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,127
Look closely.

512
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,924
This is Kaiming Gate.

513
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:14,919
Since I’ve eaten your food
and drank your wine,

514
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,839
I’ll repay you by showing you
how to unlock the gate.

515
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,665
Remember to sing my praise
to the people below.

516
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,988
Of course!

517
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,530
How is it? Am I amazing?

518
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,782
You’re amazing!

519
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,404
Kaiming Beast?

520
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,959
This jar of wine is called Drunken Stupor.

521
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,894
It can produce the strongest wine.

522
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,559
You’ll be drunk for three days
if you drink one jar.

523
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,608
This silly beast drank nine of them.

524
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,179
They’ll sleep for 27 days at least.

525
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,074
So, you knew Kaiming Beast was silly.

526
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:03,601
That’s why you’ve prepared a solution.

527
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:06,447
Of course. If not, Si Feng
wouldn’t ask you to find me.

528
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,706
We deceived such an innocent beast.

529
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:11,519
I feel like I’m the villain now.

530
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,214
That’s enough. We should leave
while the portal is open.

531
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:16,439
It’ll be difficult
if someone sees us later.

532
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,930
Right! Let’s go!

533
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,321
What happened?

534
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,463
It’s the Phoenix.

535
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,374
Phoenix is the king of all birds.

536
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,047
It’s the natural counter
of the Rose Gold Birds.

537
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:50,778
Its call can rupture my internal organs.

538
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,331
Hurry!

539
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,999
Since the Asura clan had
surrendered to the heavens,

540
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,239
you may return to the Demon Citadel.

541
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,999
Do your part and don’t create trouble.

542
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,067
Go now.

543
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,364
The Asura clan is
bloodthirsty and ruthless.

544
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,659
They will disrupt the peace
of the three realms.

545
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,030
We mustn’t release the tiger
back to the mountain.

546
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:22,643
Leave none of them alive.

547
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,326
Kill them.

548
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:29,745
Yes.

549
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,159
The Jade Emperor actually
went back on his words?

550
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,693
The Asura clan is
bloodthirsty and ruthless.

551
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:40,559
Today, all of you will end up
like Rahu Ketu.

552
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,959
All of you will die under
the blade of the God of War!

553
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,930
You? The God of War?

554
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,050
You killed Rahu Ketu?

555
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,010
What a joke!

556
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,000
With the vengeful spirits
of my clan, I’ll curse you!

557
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,250
You’ll never have a good end

558
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,680
for all eternity!

559
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,766
Their blood was still warm

560
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,730
when I killed them. I don’t like that.

561
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,452
Before they die, all of them
stared at me with resentment.

562
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:03,537
General, I think you’re too exhausted.

563
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,660
I’ll find you some medicine
that can clear your mind.

564
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:08,744
Lord Medic,

565
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,764
you’ve been treating me
for such a long time.

566
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:14,930
Did you discover that my memories
were missing?

567
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,490
General, what do you mean by that?

568
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,530
King Asura stared at me when I killed him.

569
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,330
He said I was a traitor.
I thought he was familiar.

570
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,569
But I can’t remember anything.

571
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,850
And today, a new heavenly officer
asked me for my name.

572
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,618
I tried to think, only to realize that you
only call me the God of War or General.

573
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,370
I can’t even remember my name.

574
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,678
Lord Medic.

575
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,565
Do you know my name?

576
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:52,785
I’m a low-rank official.

577
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:56,344
I don’t know much about
the high-rank officials.

578
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,054
Don’t tell me I don’t have a name
since birth?

579
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,850
Since birth...

580
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,570
Where exactly did I come from?

581
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,886
Wu Zhi Qi, you better give up!

582
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:39,177
And return Juntian Loop
and Chehai Hook to the heavens!

583
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,757
Do Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook
belong to the heavens?

584
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:44,456
You killed Star of Mosha and
took his Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook!

585
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,707
I’m just taking back
what’s rightfully ours!

586
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,010
God of War, King Asura wants me
to send you a message.

587
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,787
God of War, I was
murdered by you.

588
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,690
But I retained my last breath just to
send you a huge gift!

589
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,341
You better take a good look at the
secrets hidden within Bailing’s palace!

590
00:44:27,944 --> 00:44:31,434
You deserve all of this!

591
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,255
I...

592
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,730
Who am I?

593
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,650
Where’s my soul?

594
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,498
Siming Hall!

595
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,958
True events are recorded
in the jade tablets.

596
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:07,656
But King Bailing actually asked us
to change the God of War’s history?

597
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:09,239
This doesn’t conform to the rules.

598
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,959
If the God of War knew that
she was an Asura in the past

599
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,919
and she decimated her whole
clan, hell will break loose.

600
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,769
Of course we need to hide this fact.

601
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,519
Stop it now.
King Bailing sent us here

602
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,038
precisely because he wants to
hide this fact from everyone.

603
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,279
If news of this gets out,

604
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,999
we will be punished
by the heavenly lightning.

605
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,737
We should do our job and
leave the rest to King Bailing.

606
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,120
King Bailing captured Rahu Ketu.

607
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,750
King Bailing extracted his soul
and sealed it within the Jade Cup.

608
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,250
It’s too late when the Jade Emperor
found out that King Bailing

609
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,688
colluded with the southern immortals.

610
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:53,829
King Bailing reconstructed Rahu Ketu.

611
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:58,083
The God of War was created after that.

612
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,369
Is this

613
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,098
telling the truth?

614
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,221
Bailing! Come out!
