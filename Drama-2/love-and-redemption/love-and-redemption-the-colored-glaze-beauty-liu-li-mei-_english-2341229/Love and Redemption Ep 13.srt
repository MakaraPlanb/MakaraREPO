<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,588
<i>EPISODE 13</i>

3
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,960
Why are you so quiet? Is it tasty?

4
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,091
You scared me.
I thought they are here to ask us to pay.

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,875
Don’t worry. I’m the one who cooked these.

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,159
You are the one who cooked these?

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,020
No need to worry anymore.

8
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,359
When did you learn how to cook?

9
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,679
I learnt it last night. It’s not hard.

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,719
Si Feng, you are so awesome!

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,549
With Si Feng here, from now
on, we’ll have endless good food.

12
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,519
Because you like to eat.

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,301
Now, you won’t have to always
think about Shaoyang’s food anymore.

14
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,779
Am I right?

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,715
Now, I’m thinking just about you.

16
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,617
You are here, Yan Ran?

17
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,020
Yan Ran.

18
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,972
Si Feng cooked so much food for Xuan Ji.

19
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,559
You can have some too.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,309
If you talk when you eat,
you’ll be choked to death.

21
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,599
- What did you say?
- What’s wrong?

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,783
- I invited you for food, but...
- What did I do wrong?

23
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,863
- What kind of attitude is that?
- I think...

24
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,519
- Ling Long.
- This dish!

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,168
I’m going to take this back
and let Yu’Er taste it.

26
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,812
That brat has been
ignoring me for two days.

27
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:56,689
Maybe I can make her talk with this dish.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,364
Have a seat. Enjoy your food.

29
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,973
Yan Ran,
you already scared Brother Liu off.

30
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:08,705
Just sit down and eat.

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,282
- Sit down. Come on.
- I’ll just eat then.

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,911
Eat.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,879
Although this century egg
doesn’t smell so good,

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,335
it’s exceptionally tasty.

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,477
Xuan Ji.

36
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,683
You have sense of smell now?

37
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:42,555
Yesterday, Si Feng gave me
a shard of the Mirror of Origin.

38
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,199
Now, my sense of smell is back.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,202
Besides, I’ve come round. From now on,
I’ll keep searching for my six senses.

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,639
But aren’t you afraid that you’ll
fall into the traps of demons again?

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,759
No. Because I know that
all of you will help me out.

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,053
Come. This calls for a celebration.

43
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,359
We’ll go through
all difficulties together.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,510
Cheers.

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,719
Yu’Er!

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
Where are you?

48
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:18,348
Brother Liu, what happened?

49
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,454
Yu’Er left this.

50
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,799
<i>I’m leaving, Old Fogey.
I don’t need you to be my father.</i>

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,437
<i>I rather not see you again. Yu’Er.</i>

52
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,239
I’ll go and get her back now.

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,880
Forget it.

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,084
I’m such a failed father.

55
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:41,079
Yu’Er hates me.
It’s pointless to force her to come back.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,399
Besides, if I bring all of you
with me, she’ll be even angrier.

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,388
I better get her back myself.

58
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,119
Little Phoenix.

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,526
When I opened the celestial eye
before this, I saw a shard of

60
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:01,309
the Mirror of Origin
on Mount Gao in Zhongli City.

61
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,725
If you have the chance,
go and find it together with Xuan Ji.

62
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,638
Remember to seize the opportunity.

63
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:13,566
If you can really marry Xuan Ji,
I will treat you to a drink.

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,830
Alright, everybody.

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,680
We’ll part here today. See you again.

66
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:30,730
Si Feng, where are we going next?

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,559
Zhongli City.

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,639
Zhongli City?

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,007
Zhongli City?

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
<i>JIAXUAN TEAHOUSE</i>

71
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,954
Great!

72
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,719
Great!

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,920
- Look!
- Again!

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,119
Again!

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,079
Lu Yan Ran.

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,639
What is it?

77
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,362
Since you are uninterested with the thing
we want to find, why did you follow us?

78
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:29,759
That’s up to me to decide.
None of your business.

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,929
- What do you mean? You...
- Ling Long, forget it.

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,799
Forget it.

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,309
We’ve gone through so much together.

82
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,479
- Let’s just travel together.
- I...

83
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,439
Yes. It’s difficult to train alone.

84
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,647
With Yan Ran here,
we can take care of each other.

85
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:47,448
You are like an annoying leech
that we can’t get rid of.

86
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,214
Have a look.

87
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,377
Excuse me, where is Mount Gao?

88
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,710
Mount Deity is the only mountain
in Zhongli City.

89
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,679
It’s where Goddess Gao lives.

90
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,503
We don’t have any Mount Gao.

91
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,759
Look. There are so many people here.

92
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,242
They are all here to watch
Goddess Gao descend to the earth.

93
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:07,015
Where is Mount Deity then?

94
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,159
It’s over there.
But mortals can’t go up there.

95
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,159
Okay, thank you.

96
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,997
Si Feng, could it be that this
Mount Deity is Mount Gao?

97
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:20,191
Let’s go and take a look then. Let’s go.

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,645
Let’s go.

99
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,822
"Deity Gao resides on this mountain."

100
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:46,119
"This is where
the auspicious ray of sun hits."

101
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,159
Deity Gao. Mount Deity.

102
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,679
This is Mount Gao.

103
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,999
Let’s go.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,359
Wait.

105
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,692
Ruo Yu, Min Yan.

106
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,399
What a strong barrier.

107
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,679
No normal people
can build this kind of barrier.

108
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,117
Could it be that there’s
really a deity here?

109
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:01,319
But I don’t feel the aura of deity here.

110
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,494
It makes me feel uncomfortable instead.

111
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:09,359
No worries. Goddess Gao
is descending to the earth today.

112
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
When she does that,
the barrier will be opened.

113
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,965
Let’s stay in Zhongli City for a while.

114
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:19,199
When Goddess Gao descends,
we’ll find a way to get in.

115
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,358
We are going into the city?

116
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,159
- Can we...
- We can have some good food now!

117
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,839
Ling Long, what is this?

118
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,959
This one? This is red bean cake.

119
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,159
This is green cake,
yellow cake and purple cake.

120
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,604
Miss, look at my conch. It’s beautiful
and you can hear the sound of sea.

121
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,669
Buy one.

122
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,147
Listen.

123
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:48,627
- Ruo Yu.
- Si Feng.

124
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,218
- Give this to everyone.
- What did you buy?

125
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,879
Xuan Ji.

126
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,239
You have a sweet tooth.

127
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,999
I bought you qingtuan.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,477
Thank you.

129
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:09,559
This qingtuan is really tasty.

130
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,359
I’ve never tasted something
like this before. You should have one too.

131
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,752
I’m fine.

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,549
It’s Cold Food Festival today.

133
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,287
You can only find qingtuan
during Cold Food Festival.

134
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,084
It’s very lively over there.
Let me bring you there.

135
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,999
Is this good?

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,394
Let me take a look.

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
Ruo Yu, drink some pear blossom soup.

138
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,163
Move aside.

139
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,295
Someone is feeling sour enough.
You don’t need this soup.

140
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,639
Someone is venomous enough that
I don’t want it.

141
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,230
Someone is jealous because
Si Feng treats Xuan Ji so well.

142
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:46,879
You are not as cute as my sister.

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,005
You are ill-tempered and a troublemaker.
Si Feng won’t like you.

144
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:52,279
You are criticising me?

145
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,909
Two days ago,
you were so close with Si Feng.

146
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,999
Now, you can’t be apart
from your Sixth Senior.

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,399
How interesting.

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,796
You...

149
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,195
- You...
- Enough.

150
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,685
There are so many people here.
Won’t you feel embarrassed?

151
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,766
Later, Si Feng will lecture you again.

152
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,799
Why do you have to argue
with that Lu Yan Ran?

153
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,228
She’s so spoilt.
She’ll just ruin your mood.

154
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,335
Ling Long, let’s have our fortune told
to see our luck.

155
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,307
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

156
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,519
- Boss.
- Have a seat.

157
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,914
We want to have our fortune told.

158
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,479
The goddess is descending to earth today,
it’ll definitely be lucky for you.

159
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,040
I’ll do it.

160
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>PATRICIDE</i>

161
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,390
Miss, what do you want to know?

162
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,232
My luck for this year.

163
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,159
You got the patricide lot.

164
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,116
This is the worst lot.

165
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,393
You’ll be in a lot of troubles.
And they will come in waves.

166
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,879
This is a bad omen.

167
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,719
Little Six. They are just here
to cheat our money. Let’s go.

168
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,119
Ling Long.

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,429
I’m the one who wants to do this.
I should shake it. Yours doesn’t count.

170
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,945
Let me do it.

171
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,759
<i>MARRIAGE</i>

172
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,159
This marriage lot just means that
you’ll have moderate luck

173
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,399
if you are asking about luck.

174
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,239
I’m not asking about luck.

175
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
- I’m asking about my relationship.
- Your relationship?

176
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,479
Then, this is the best lot
that you can get.

177
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,038
It means that
all shall be well, Jack shall have Jill.

178
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,313
Ling Long.

179
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,203
Ling Long.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,697
Ling Long.

181
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,399
This is for you.

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,079
All shall be well, Jack shall have Jill.
So auspicious.

183
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,018
When I propose our marriage to
Master, you can show him this lot.

184
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,621
We are destined to be together.
Master will definitely agree.

185
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,081
What proposal?
We just resolved our misunderstanding.

186
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,159
I won’t necessarily marry you.
Take away your marriage lot.

187
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,022
Are you really not going to take it?

188
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:22,182
If you don’t take my lot, my heart
will not be able to settle down.

189
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:24,545
Aren’t you afraid that
I’ll give it to another lady?

190
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,318
You can give it to whoever you want.
I don’t want it.

191
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,255
Are you really not going to take it?

192
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,802
I’ll give it to another lady then.

193
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,630
You...

194
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,279
- Ling Long, I was just joking.
- Fine!

195
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,639
Give your marriage lot to
whoever you want. Don’t give it to me!

196
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,251
Ling Long!

197
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,579
Look, Si Feng.

198
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,836
Look, Si Feng!

199
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,128
Don’t move.

200
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,900
Don’t break the hair.

201
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:52,905
It’ll be a bad omen. Let me get it out.

202
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,719
Wait for me there.

203
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,635
Your hair is in a mess.
Let me buy you a hairpin.

204
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,794
It’s not in a mess.

205
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,184
But I am.

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,891
Miss, you are not
from here, right?

207
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,079
How do you know?

208
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,652
I know every girl in Zhongli City.

209
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,335
I am a local here.

210
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:46,679
If you don’t mind, how about I
volunteer myself to show you around?

211
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,956
Do you have any ancient
treasures in this city?

212
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,039
Of course.

213
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,908
I have a house full of treasures.

214
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,559
If you are willing,
how about we go there and take a look?

215
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,382
Do you have an ancient mirror
in your house?

216
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:04,133
Yes. I’m an ancient mirrors collector.

217
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,953
I have a lot of mirrors.

218
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,921
Great. We’ll go there together with
my friend when he comes back then.

219
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,409
Let’s go, Miss. Don’t miss the chance.

220
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,659
Si Feng.

221
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,048
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

222
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,599
This is the hairpin I chose for you.

223
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,038
Do you like it?

224
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,622
This hairpin is so beautiful.

225
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:38,466
Put it on for me.

226
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,332
Okay.

227
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,199
Immortal Master.

228
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,778
Immortal Master.

229
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,452
Immortal Master,
can you put me down first?

230
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,295
No one ever tells you not to
make a move on the ladies?

231
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:10,128
Immortal Master, I was just trying
to be a good host just now.

232
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,999
Please forgive me and let me down.

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,239
Since you want to be a good host, great.

234
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,717
Help us check out the scenery
from above then.

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,079
- Immortal Master!
- Well...

236
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,759
Si Feng.

237
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,919
Why are you angry?

238
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,685
Isn’t he a kind man?

239
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:33,719
I’m flying him up
there to repay him.

240
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,149
But just now, he said that
he might have the Mirror of Origin.

241
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,325
How could a mortal own an immortal object?

242
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,319
He was just lying to you.

243
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
He was lying to me?

244
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,839
Lying is not good.

245
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,197
From now on,
don’t talk to any male strangers.

246
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,803
Understand?

247
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,438
Okay.

248
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:24,720
Right on time. Let’s see how this goddess
descends from the mountain.

249
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,660
The goddess has shown herself.

250
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:41,599
This is the name list of the people
that she wants to take in for this year.

251
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,199
Later, I’ll send it to every family.

252
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,839
Kowtow now.

253
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,359
Thank her for bringing prosperity
to this land

254
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
and protecting the people from danger.

255
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
- Thank you, Goddess!
- Thank you, Goddess!

256
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:57,999
<i>GODDESS PAVILION</i>

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Open the door.

258
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,006
So, this is what they mean by
the goddess descends.

259
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:12,949
The goddess just used her
power to send a piece of note here.

260
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,037
She didn’t open the barrier at all.

261
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:16,718
We can’t go in.

262
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,700
Xuan Ji.

263
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,959
Are you saying that
when the goddess descended,

264
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,879
there’s demonic aura
inside that purple smoke?

265
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,639
Besides, it’s the same demon
that caught Elder Ling Shi.

266
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,831
I still remember it. I won’t be wrong.

267
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,999
- Immortal Master, help us!
- Please save us.

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,716
- Please save us.
- Please save us, Immortal Master.

269
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,749
Why is it you again?

270
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,526
Immortal Master,

271
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,550
I am Fang Yi Zhen.
I was born and raised in Zhongli City.

272
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,535
I’ve offended you before this.

273
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:04,928
Please be magnanimous
and save me.

274
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,925
That Goddess Gao wants to kill us.

275
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,799
- Immortal Master, save us.
- Please save us.

276
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,982
Get up first and let’s talk.

277
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,866
Stop kneeling. Get up.

278
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,339
What’s wrong?

279
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,720
Goddess Gao will choose four men
every year to go up there to serve her.

280
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,574
This year, she chose the four of us.

281
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:24,959
We have to go up tomorrow.

282
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,005
But we’ll definitely lose our lives.

283
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,519
We have no other choice.

284
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,901
I saw how capable you are.

285
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:34,201
You must be very powerful.

286
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:37,947
You must be from the cultivator sect
that saves the people from evil.

287
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:41,519
- So, please save us.
- Please save us.

288
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,021
- I beg you.
- Besides, that goddess is not a deity.

289
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:47,702
It’s a demon.

290
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,439
How do you know that?

291
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,292
Well...

292
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,280
I was once curious about
how the goddess looks like.

293
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,650
So, I followed those wedding sedan
to go into the mountain to spy on her.

294
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,880
That goddess is definitely not kind.

295
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,781
But everyone here looks up
to her as goddess.

296
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,833
They wouldn’t believe me.

297
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,669
At first, I wanted to ask those grooms
after they come back.

298
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,039
But who knows that nobody will hear
from those chosen grooms anymore?

299
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,870
We’ve never even gotten
a letter from them.

300
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,054
All of them must be dead now.

301
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,694
There’s a barrier on that mountain.

302
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,141
How did the grooms go up the mountain?

303
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:44,677
All the chosen men will wait for her
outside of the mountain gate every year.

304
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,638
When the time is right,
she will send someone to bring them in.

305
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:53,834
Immortal Master, please save us.

306
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:56,839
- I beg you. Please save us.
- Please save us.

307
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,362
Okay.

308
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:04,159
Tomorrow, me, Min Yan and Ruo
Yu will pretend to be her grooms.

309
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,446
That way, we can save these men

310
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,677
and go up the mountain
to search for our thing.

311
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,039
Killing two birds with one stone.

312
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,039
- Thank you, Immortal Master.
- Wait.

313
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,279
But there are only three of you.

314
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,116
Do we need to find another man
to make up for the missing one?

315
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,279
I can’t. I’ll faint when I’m nervous.

316
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,074
I can’t too. I’ll vomit.

317
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,228
They are too much of a coward.

318
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,957
They’ll just create troubles.

319
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:35,526
How about I ask Yan
Ran and Ling Long

320
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,959
to dress up as men to fool her?

321
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,245
If that’s the case, let me go with you.

322
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,399
No. It’s too dangerous for you.

323
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,919
It’s alright.
I’ve mastered all kinds of spells.

324
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,974
I’m confident that
I can defeat those demons.

325
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:51,534
Don’t worry.

326
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,399
Okay.

327
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,560
I will protect you.

328
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,742
Xuan Ji, I’m really worried about
your trip to the mountain tomorrow.

329
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:09,374
Have you embroidered all of your spells?

330
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,582
Look.

331
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:14,294
I’ve embroidered all demon-related spells
that I can think of on this dress.

332
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:17,725
Tomorrow, I just need to wear it and I’ll
be able to handle all kinds of demons.

333
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,436
I’m more at ease now.

334
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,333
Little Six, remember to protect
Xuan Ji well, do you hear me?

335
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,021
Don’t worry. Leave it to me.

336
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:26,582
Look.

337
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:32,203
Isn’t this

338
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:36,199
the bracelet that Aunt Ying Hong gave us
when we were around ten?

339
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,818
I lost mine. Let me take a look at it.

340
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,881
Aunt Ying Hong gave it to us when
we were fourteen years old.

341
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,817
Look. You said that one bead
represents two years.

342
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:51,837
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

343
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,845
Why is there an eight bead?

344
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:56,279
Maybe you remembered it wrongly.

345
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,239
She must have given it to you
when you were 16.

346
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,999
But I just cleaned these beads
before I left Shouyang Peak,

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,519
There were only seven.

348
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,453
- Why is there an extra one?
- Alright now. Don’t think too much.

349
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:09,348
You must have remembered it wrongly.

350
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,730
By the way, Ling Long.

351
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:13,714
Keep this Sound Bell.

352
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:17,759
Great. Then, I can
contact you anytime tomorrow.

353
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,999
Take good care of yourself
when I’m not here.

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,617
Don’t always quarrel with Lu Yan Ran.

355
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:24,098
Don’t worry. She’s not my match.

356
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,915
Be careful tomorrow.

357
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:40,479
I’m tired. We have to rest earlier.

358
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,295
You can leave now.

359
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,279
Xuan Ji.

360
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,521
You have to travel tomorrow.
Rest earlier. I want to sleep now.

361
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,522
I’m sure that there were only seven.

362
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,076
<i>SHAOYANG</i>

363
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,397
So many days have passed.

364
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:21,053
Why I still haven’t heard anything
from Xuan Ji yet?

365
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:24,628
Could it be that
she’s in trouble?

366
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,199
Senior!

367
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,473
Senior, something went wrong
when Master went to meditate in seclusion.

368
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:50,909
Master.

369
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,506
I’m fine.

370
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:56,878
I was just training myself to control
the eye of the formation just now.

371
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:03,559
When I was in training, I was too
impatient and lost some energy.

372
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,161
You may leave now.

373
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:08,198
I just need Hao Chen to be here.

374
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,737
Yes, Master.

375
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,759
Master.

376
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,925
I need some time to recover.

377
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:20,159
During this time,

378
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,605
guard the eye of the formation
for the secret ground well.

379
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:25,207
Don’t be distracted.

380
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,693
I understand.

381
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,359
Master.

382
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,157
You still can’t unravel the true meaning
of the Heartless Tactics?

383
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:38,637
I dedicated my whole life to
learn about the Heartless Tactics.

384
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:43,173
But the more I learn,
the more I doubt myself.

385
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:47,519
Hao Chen, do you know
that Heartless Tactics is not

386
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,564
the only way of cultivation
in Xuyang Peak?

387
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,382
We have the Sentimental Tactics too.

388
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:56,560
But the one you are learning
is the Heartless Tactics.

389
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,124
In the past, I thought
that I was determined.

390
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:09,485
I believed that if I was
doing it for the people,

391
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,159
I would be able to get rid of
all my personal feelings.

392
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,279
So, I chose the Heartless Tactics
without a second thought.

393
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,526
But for the past two years,

394
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:25,453
I realised that the ultimate
skill of Heartless Tactics

395
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:27,799
is to let go of your feelings.

396
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,079
But if you never have any feelings before,

397
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,720
how are you going
to know how they feel like?

398
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,468
So, what can you let go?

399
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:40,479
So, I couldn’t help myself but to
read about that Sentimental Tactics.

400
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,999
And I realised that the tactics
of the Sentimental Tactics

401
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,919
are way more powerful than
the Heartless Tactics.

402
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,781
Looks like I’ve been wrong
since the very beginning.

403
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:55,975
But even if I want to learn
that Sentimental Tactics now,

404
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,273
my feelings are already gone.

405
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:04,188
And I have no one to learn it with me.

406
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:08,132
Master, you’ve begun to waver.

407
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,750
So, Hao Chen,

408
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,919
use me as an example.

409
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,382
Be sure of what you want.

410
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:19,274
Or else,

411
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:22,119
everything will be too late.

412
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,645
I think that there are
many ways in this world.

413
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:27,471
But they are just ways.

414
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,854
No matter it’s Sentimental Tactics
or Heartless Tactics,

415
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,679
there’s no limit to them.

416
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,199
As long as it’s the correct way,
we can use it.

417
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,069
No matter what way we use,
our goal is to reach the heavenly realm.

418
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,909
So, do it for the heavenly realm.

419
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,399
Every way is the correct way.

420
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,402
Every way is the correct way.

421
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,279
You’ve surpassed me.

422
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,509
I am too narrow-minded.

423
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,850
You are even more incisive than I am.

424
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:06,406
Hao Chen, sometimes, I even
think that you are so mature that

425
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,479
you don’t look like your age.

426
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,160
Instead, you look like someone
who has lived for thousands of years.

427
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,052
Thank you for the compliment.

428
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,205
Welcome, gentlemen.
Please get down from the sedan.

429
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,070
Please change your clothes.

430
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,933
Why is this a woman’s wedding gown?

431
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:01,756
The goddess is marrying you. Of course
you have to wear the wedding gown.

432
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:04,716
You better change now.
We don’t want to be late.

433
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:06,144
How am I going to change?

434
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,399
How about I help you?

435
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,815
No need. I can do it myself.

436
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,839
- How about I help you?
- Please have some self-respect.

437
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,823
Gentlemen, it’s disrespectful
to meet the goddess with your masks on.

438
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:30,981
You better take it off.

439
00:31:30,982 --> 00:31:32,599
You don’t know about it.

440
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,751
But this is our home town’s custom
as a respect for the deity.

441
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:37,279
When we pay respect to the deity,
we have to wear this mask.

442
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,639
We can only take it down then
the time is right as a form of respect.

443
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,468
If we take it down before that,
it’ll be disrespectful.

444
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:48,872
If you are so respectful to the
goddess, you can keep your mask on.

445
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:26,987
Si Feng looks quite handsome
in this attire.

446
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:31,157
This demon is so troublesome.
Why do they have to wear wedding gown?

447
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,891
You are angry at this too?

448
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,919
I think you are just jealous because
Si Feng is taking care of Xuan Ji

449
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,719
so well.

450
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,639
Let me tell you.
You have no chance. Clear?

451
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,135
You...

452
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,720
Look at you.

453
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,282
Min Yan looks quite handsome too.

454
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,757
Gentleman, it has taken you so long.

455
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:18,409
How about I help you with it?

456
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,599
It’s alright.

457
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,701
Look at this gown.

458
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:24,959
It doesn’t suit me.

459
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,999
How about I don’t change?

460
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,759
Xuan Ji hasn’t changed her clothes yet?

461
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,415
I can help you with it.

462
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,862
Goddess.

463
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:34,805
My friend is a little bit shy.

464
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,359
I’ll help him with it.

465
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,440
Please give us some privacy.

466
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:41,943
What a shy gentleman.

467
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,079
They almost found out that I’m a woman.

468
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Hurry up and change now.
I’ll keep an eye out for you.

469
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
- This...
- Come. Let me help you with it.

470
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,758
It’s done, Xuan Ji.

471
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,693
Xuan Ji.

472
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,707
There is Love Drug on this veil.

473
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:52,596
Xuan Ji, remember to
hold your breath later.

474
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:56,126
I’ll find a chance to tell
Min Yan and Ruo Yu about it.

475
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,484
Please get into the sedan.

476
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,381
Alright, let’s go.

477
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,783
They are leaving now. Let’s go.

478
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,525
Sect Leader Zhu Shi.

479
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,206
How are you?

480
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,116
You are Wu Tong?

481
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,199
Thank you for still remembering
a nobody like me.

482
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,926
Now, you work for the devil
and feed on souls of the living

483
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:06,999
to increase you power?

484
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,421
If I didn’t do it, I wouldn’t
have the rights to stand here

485
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:14,399
and talk to the sect leader
of Xuanyuan Sect.

486
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,309
Sect Leader Zhu Shi.

487
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,919
Give me the spirit key.

488
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,119
Dream on!

489
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,079
I don’t have much patience now.

490
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,439
With my power now, I can annihilate
Xuanyuan Sect in a blink of an eye.

491
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,014
You betray your ancestor and
be the jackal to the tiger.

492
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,637
You even used drugs to control Xuanyuan.

493
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:35,319
Everything you did are
despicable and shameless.

494
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,355
You are even worse than a demon!

495
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,239
What a joke.

496
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,581
You are the one who took the drugs
to increase your power.

497
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:49,679
Do you think that there’s such
thing as free meals in this world?

498
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,909
Xuanyuan Sect is greedy but useless.

499
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,821
I think Xuanyuan Sect is the
one that is worse than demons.

500
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:03,983
This calamity of Xuanyuan
is brought upon by me.

501
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,341
I was too competitive until I
forgot about my cultivation.

502
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:12,559
I exposed my own weakness
for you to exploit.

503
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,023
Xuanyuan was wrong once.

504
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,159
We will not do it again.

505
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,409
Listen to my order, disciples of Xuanyuan.

506
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:26,013
Today, Xuanyuan Sect vows

507
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:28,719
to fight against these demons
with our lives!

508
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,137
We will not bow down to anyone!

509
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,847
I thought all the righteous sects
face death with a smile.

510
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:58,839
So, all of you are just cowards.

511
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,278
Do you think that these demons
will let you go

512
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,660
if you don’t fight back?

513
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:10,261
You don’t even have
the quality of a cultivator.

514
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:15,599
Listen to me, disciples of Xuanyuan.

515
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,152
If you kneel to me now,
I’ll feed you the drugs later.

516
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,603
If you want to die, I don’t
mind to feed on more souls.

517
00:38:54,536 --> 00:39:00,087
I never thought that the disciples
of Xuanyuan are just some cowards.

518
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,545
Xuanyuan Sects was established
1300 years ago.

519
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,886
Looks like

520
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,227
it’s going to end here today.

521
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,251
I’ve let down my master.

522
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,479
I’ve let down my ancestors.

523
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,879
Okay.

524
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,197
Today, I’m going to use
my life to repay Xuanyuan.

525
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,319
Putting aside that you are powerless now
because of the Kunyin Pill you took,

526
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,999
even if your power had recovered,

527
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,521
with my power now,
I had nothing to be afraid of.

528
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,639
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader!

529
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,390
-Sect Leader!

530
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,599
- Have you found the spirit key?
- Not yet.

531
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,399
Useless!

532
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,159
Where is the spirit key?

533
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,440
If you don’t tell me now,
all of you will die!

534
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,621
Master, I... I know
where the spirit key is.

535
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:53,959
It’s you.

536
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,559
Shi Feng?

537
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,839
You came first during the
Flower Session back then.

538
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,229
But that was supposed to be mine.

539
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,239
The judge was unfair.

540
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,479
I’m just a weak little thing.

541
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,530
How can I ever compete with you?

542
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,797
Not bad. You are quite sensible.

543
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:26,483
Since you know where it is,
bring me to it now.

544
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,333
Yes.

545
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,960
<i>XUANYUAN HALL</i>

546
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,959
How did this happen?

547
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,279
The spirit key of Xuanyuan Sect

548
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,997
has always been hidden
inside the Destiny Pearl.

549
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:58,487
We need this key
to open the Treasure Cove.

550
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,490
Why is the Destiny Pearl gone?

551
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,736
How dare you fool me.

552
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:07,857
I wouldn’t dare. I didn’t lie.

553
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:11,761
Did anyone come here recently?

554
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,559
A few days ago, Chu Xuan Ji,
Chu Ling Long from Shaoyang Sect

555
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,000
and Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace
came to Xuanyuan.

556
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:26,279
And our sect leader asked them
to give a present to Lord Dong Fang.

557
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,719
Give this present
to Lord Dong Fang.

558
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,389
But our elders already
checked the present.

559
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,421
Nothing was wrong with it.

560
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,575
He must have used the spell of deceit.

561
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,720
Looks like the Destiny Pearl is
with Chu Xuan Ji and the others.

562
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,083
Gentlemen, please get down from the sedan.

563
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,959
- Come, gentleman.
- Come here.

564
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,552
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat, gentlemen.

565
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,366
- Looks, he’s shy.
- Young gentleman.

566
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,287
Come, want a drink?

567
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,369
- Come on, don’t be shy.
- You should drink it yourself.

568
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,573
Come on, gentleman.

569
00:43:29,534 --> 00:43:31,410
This wine is spiked, don’t drink it.

570
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:40,387
Where is Goddess Gao? Ask her to come out!

571
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,920
No need to look for me.

572
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,965
I’m here.

573
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,359
We meet again.

574
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,737
I’m waiting for you here.

575
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:01,959
The energy of cultivators is even
more powerful than normal people.

576
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,719
It’ll be very fortunate
if I can take a sip of it.

577
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,293
She’s a seductress and
she wants to feed on energy.

578
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:09,639
She must be a fox demon.

579
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,654
She must be a thousand years old.

580
00:44:11,655 --> 00:44:14,319
So smart. You are right.

581
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,799
I am the Thousand-Year-Old Purple Fox.

582
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,680
Since you got it right,
what rewards do you want?

583
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,160
You are still fine after
inhaling my Love Smoke?

584
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,949
You are a woman?

585
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,279
You disguised as a man to trick me.

586
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,694
Mount Gao will never spare a woman!

587
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,811
Don’t hurt her.

588
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,696
Interesting.

589
00:45:26,697 --> 00:45:30,257
I never thought that
both of you are a couple.
