00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,850
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 3</i>

3
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,520
Greetings, masters.

4
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,946
The Lutai Town under my governance
was always attacked by demons.

5
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:06,520
That’s the reason I put up
a notice to invite masters like you all.

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,927
Masters, you guys made in just in time.

7
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,959
Words can’t express my gratitude.

8
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,639
Village officer, you’re too courteous.

9
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,274
This is our responsibility.

10
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:18,279
You should let us see
the corpses of the victims.

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,617
Please.

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,399
He was killed on Mount Lutai yesterday.

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,898
Five of them were travelling together.

14
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,440
But we only managed to find one body.

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,563
Demons!

16
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,799
There are four people left on the
mountains, including my wife and child.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,683
Some brave guards and hunters
went up the mountains to find them.

18
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,919
But they didn’t find a single body.

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,879
Mount Lutai is the only path
the townsfolk could use,

20
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,720
but now, all of us are trapped here.

21
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,840
What should we do now?

22
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,999
Everyone, calm down.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,439
We’re here.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,926
We will slay the demons.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,720
- Thank you, masters.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,711
So, according to the
information and the wounds,

27
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,360
I’m sure the culprit is
the Gudiao on Mount Lutai.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,919
Xuan Ji, don’t touch him.

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,919
Father, I don’t think a bird
was behind the wounds.

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,359
I think a dog was the cause.

31
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,719
Don’t simple speak.

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,839
I’m not.

33
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,039
Sect Leader Chu, Lord Dong
Fang, the wounds are strange indeed.

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,719
Look at them.

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,959
Although there are peck
marks on his right side,

36
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
there are bite marks on his left side.

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,879
Gudiao is a bird.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,520
It can’t leave any bite marks behind.

39
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,619
We were too careless.

40
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,279
We didn’t observe the wounds closely.

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,880
The wounds were caused by another demon.

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,160
Xuan Ji is observant indeed.

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,999
Look at her.
The young talents are amazing.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,519
Actually, I’ve noticed that long ago.
I just didn’t want to say them out.

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,560
I’m sure there are other demons
besides Gudiao on Mount Lutai.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,439
I’m sure there is more than one demon.

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,324
Everyone, don’t panic.

48
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:24,799
Please don’t panic.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,079
Village officer, with our capabilities,

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,503
we can handle them if
we devise a careful plan.

51
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:33,260
Please bring us to the villagers
who had seen the demons

52
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,953
so that we may understand
the situation better.

53
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,319
Okay. Let’s hurry.

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,309
- Follow me.
- Please.

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,245
Xuan Ji, you and Hero Yu

56
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,440
can go and get the things
required to capture Gudiao.

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,656
Xuan Ji.

58
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,351
This is for you.

59
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,279
What is this?

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,519
This is Lightning Truncheon.

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,159
It can teleport you around.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,501
Just hold it in your palm and think
about the place you want to go.

63
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:16,400
You can master this with just a few uses.

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,319
Although we’ll try our best
to protect you later,

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,117
we may not be able to
protect you all the time.

66
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:25,000
This item can help you
to escape from danger.

67
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
Thank you, Senior Hao Chen.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Gudiao?

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,799
What do we need to capture it?

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,062
Si Feng?

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,999
Si Feng, how did you manage
to find the items required?

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,639
Salt water will hurt its eyes.

73
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,079
- And...
- Be careful.

74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,439
Sorry.

75
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,679
So, salt water will hurt its eyes.

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,879
- Sir.
- That way, we can capture it, right?

77
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,359
You wanted salt in sacks, right?

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,764
Thank you, sir.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,406
Si Feng,

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,679
you asked someone else
to buy them for you?

81
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,960
So what if I did?

82
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,599
Fine. It’s better this way.

83
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,334
I can try and use the Lightning Truncheon
Senior Hao Chen had given me.

84
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,414
Si Feng!

85
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,920
So, this is your room?

86
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,789
Do you think

87
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,560
this is the best time for us to chat?

88
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,959
Not really.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,799
I’m sorry. Did I interrupt your bath?

90
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
I’ll leave right away.

91
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
I...

92
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,000
I think my Lightning Truncheon
went missing.

93
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,159
I think it’s in the bathtub.

94
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I’ll leave once I find it.

95
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Where is it?

96
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,294
Where is it?

97
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,400
Strange man.

98
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,479
Ting Nu, stop being stubborn.

99
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,807
Although you were an immortal
medic once, that doesn’t mean anything.

100
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,439
The heavenly realm punishes you
without mercy.

101
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,821
In their eyes,

102
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,438
demons will always be demons.

103
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,639
We will never reach
the same level as them.

104
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,140
In the past, my Left Lieutenant

105
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,159
only tried to retrieve the
Divine Weapon for Star of Mosha,

106
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,959
but he was set up by the heavenly realm.

107
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,518
He was trapped under Fenru City
with the Four Dimension Chain.

108
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,159
And 1,000 years had passed since then.

109
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,039
Now, tell me.

110
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,880
How do I unlock the Four Dimension Chain?

111
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,592
You’re keeping quiet?

112
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,719
Stop!

113
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,148
Stop it now!

114
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,999
I’ll tell you!

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
What? There are other demons?

116
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,439
This is troublesome.

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,239
We only wanted to obtain Gudiao’s horns
for the Weeping Tears.

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,959
But now, there’s another demon.

119
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,879
How could we defeat them?

120
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,079
Ling Long, will they lock me up
in Mingxia Cave again?

121
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,280
Little Six, you better think of something!

122
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,889
Think of something?

123
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,853
I remembered Senior Hao Chen
said that Gudiao loves human tongues.

124
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,639
It will approach people
when it smells blood.

125
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,199
I don’t feel anything anyway.

126
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,980
By then, I’ll just bite my
tongue and try to lure it.

127
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,719
Okay?

128
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,026
So...

129
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,467
You are digging your own grave.

130
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,239
That will attract Gudiao,

131
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,999
but it’ll boost its power
tremendously as well.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Do you guys think you can survive?

133
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,319
I’m sure it’s not that bad, right?

134
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
Can you kill it then?

135
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,719
We can’t kill it by ourselves.

136
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,033
What should we do then?

137
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
The Four Dimension Chain

138
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,879
was created by the immortals,

139
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,520
using the earthly energies accumulated
from the four highest peaks in the world.

140
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,920
No one can cut it or break it.

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,600
You can only unlock them

142
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,959
by gathering the four spirit keys.

143
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,051
The four spirit keys

144
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:48,200
have been protected by the
Five Great Sects for a long time.

145
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,640
The keys are in their hands?

146
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,960
Where did they put them?

147
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,200
That’s all I know.

148
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,473
I’m not lying.

149
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,693
I told you everything I knew.

150
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:12,494
If I find out that you’re lying,

151
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
I’ll decimate the entire merman clan.

152
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,800
According to the locations
of the victims’ bodies,

153
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Gudiao is most active by
the mountainside and the nearby pond.

154
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,639
As for the other demon,
we have no clues.

155
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,600
We must be cautious
when we ascend the mountain.

156
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,909
Xuan Ji, are you tired?

157
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,135
I’m not.

158
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,057
Xuan Ji!

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,239
Xuan Ji!

160
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,479
Are you okay?

161
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,799
It hurts.

162
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,197
- What’s wrong?
- I sprained my ankle.

163
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,085
It hurts.

164
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,992
Master, Xuan Ji sprained her ankle.
She can’t walk anymore.

165
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,479
This troublesome girl.

166
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,833
I told you to train hard. Look at you.

167
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,600
You’re injured now and
you’re dragging everyone down.

168
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,423
Senior, I think that’s enough.

169
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,048
Just let them rest here.

170
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,999
We’ll lure Gudiao out.

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,254
That’s fine too.

172
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,503
Hero Yu, please stay
here and take care of them.

173
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,302
Xuan Ji, take this whistle.

174
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:36,103
Blow the whistle when you’re in danger.

175
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,170
Hao Chen, let’s proceed.

176
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,406
Yes.

177
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,319
I almost died! Why did you take so long?

178
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,734
Sorry, Ling Long. I forgot about you.

179
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,940
Xuan Ji, did you really sprain your ankle?

180
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,535
No. I was acting just now.

181
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,079
You’re a bad actor, you know?

182
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,127
Did you forget that
you can’t feel anything?

183
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:02,399
How could you pretend to be in pain?

184
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,550
Oh right, I forgot about that.

185
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,959
Ling Long, Min Yan,
you two should get ready.

186
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,799
After I set up the formation
and lure Gudiao here,

187
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,720
you two can remove its horns
when it’s trapped in my formation.

188
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,475
Ling Long, use this
to protect yourself.

189
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,854
This?

190
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,055
Isn’t this your family heirloom?

191
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,287
My ancestors were blacksmiths.

192
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,399
This dagger is stronger
than ordinary weapons.

193
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,759
Take it. Use it if you meet a demon.

194
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,239
But...

195
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,479
Didn’t you say you’ll give this to...

196
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,719
Yeah.

197
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,919
It’s an engagement gift
for my future wife.

198
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,435
Don’t think too much.

199
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:42,639
I’m just borrowing you.

200
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,959
You need to return it to me.

201
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,732
You’re only borrowing me?
And I need to return this?

202
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,808
You can give this to your future wife
for all I care!

203
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,599
Report! Some cultivators
are ascending Mount Lutai!

204
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,157
What? Hurry!

205
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,399
Inform all demons to leave
this hideout right away!

206
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,119
- Remember to destroy all clues!
- Yes!

207
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,301
Hurry!

208
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:18,918
Run!

209
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,631
Uncle Ting Nu is here.

210
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,813
Inform the people of our tribe.

211
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,814
Ask them to leave immediately.

212
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,012
The formation is done.

213
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,640
What a strong demonic aura.

214
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,791
Demonic aura?

215
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Xuan Ji!

216
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,433
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

217
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,766
You’re bleeding.

218
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,981
Gudiao’s power will increase
when it sees blood.

219
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:08,439
I can’t hold it off for long. Go now!

220
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,119
But Si Feng, this...

221
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,160
- Just leave!
- Let’s go!

222
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,549
- It’s actually a Tengu?
- Capture it.

223
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,430
You stay here.

224
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:19,291
Wait, didn’t you say that Gudiao
will reach its human form soon?

225
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,245
You can’t deal with it alone.
I’ll go with you.

226
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:23,240
- It’s easier for me to go alone.
- Yu Si Feng!

227
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,138
Wait.

228
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
I think something’s in the water.

229
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,179
It’s another demon!

230
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,366
Wait.

231
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,985
Why are you helping the demon?

232
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,216
It’s the scent of Gudiao!

233
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,617
I think it’s approaching us.

234
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,070
Xuan Ji!

235
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
We’ll be fine. It’s too big to fit.

236
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I think it’s going to break through soon.

237
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,794
We’re in a dire situation.

238
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,519
There’s no time. We’ll deal
with the nasty beast for now.

239
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,915
Protect Xuan Ji!

240
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,013
Si Feng!

241
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,449
Hurry! Scatter the salt!

242
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Xuan Ji, stay here.

243
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,680
Ling Long!

244
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,839
Min Yan!

245
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,113
Ling Long!

246
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,993
Si Feng!

247
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,912
This is bad!

248
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,959
Hurry!

249
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,443
Go!

250
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,959
Si Feng!

251
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,272
Ling Long!

252
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
I’ll kill you!

253
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,069
Ling Long!

254
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Xuan Ji!

255
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,320
That sound, it must be Gudiao.

256
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,270
Xuan Ji.

257
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,920
You’re digging your own grave.

258
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
Who are you?

259
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,594
Who am I?

260
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,839
Who am I?

261
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,159
Now, you understand.

262
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,443
Understand what?

263
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,360
Who am I?

264
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,359
Xuan Ji, you’re awake?

265
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,066
How do you feel?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

266
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,507
You scared me, you know?

267
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,295
Everyone is fine, right?

268
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,158
Everyone is fine.

269
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,639
Why don’t you lie down a little longer?

270
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,608
Ling Long,

271
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,879
I’m hungry.

272
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,080
You little glutton.
I’ll get you some food.

273
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,599
Xuan Ji, what exactly
happened in the cave?

274
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
Did something happen?

275
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,465
I...

276
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,330
I think I had a dream.

277
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,211
In the dream, I...

278
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,725
I...

279
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,600
I can’t remember anything.

280
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,119
Xuan Ji, how about this?

281
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,280
Follow what I do. See if it’ll help you
in recovering your memories.

282
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,119
Wait, don’t point that at me.

283
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,378
Point it over there.

284
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,182
Xuan Ji, listen.

285
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:37,439
You were so amazing
while we were in the cave.

286
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,279
You drew a circle just like that
and you vanquished the Gudiao.

287
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
I vanquished the Gudiao?

288
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,800
How is that possible? I...

289
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,057
I don’t have the capability
to vanquish the Gudiao.

290
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,244
Wait.

291
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,199
Don’t tell me that wasn’t a dream?

292
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,466
That was reality?

293
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,945
But,

294
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,559
how did something so bizarre happen to me?

295
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,800
Or...

296
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,557
I...

297
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,999
Am I the freak they spoke about?

298
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,759
Of course not, Xuan Ji.

299
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,333
There’s an explanation for this.

300
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,881
Some immortals or something like that,

301
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,359
they love to wander in the human realm
and uphold justice.

302
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,097
But it’s inappropriate
for them to show themselves.

303
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:25,485
Thus, their primordial spirits

304
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:27,239
will possess humans and humans
will become their vessels.

305
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,835
So, I’m sure that was the case.

306
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,279
That’s why you can’t remember anything.

307
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,839
- Is that so?
- Xuan Ji, I’m sure that’s the case.

308
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,780
Think about this. You don’t even
know the basics of Yang Jue Skill.

309
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,279
You can’t even summon your sword.

310
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,999
But you managed to vanquish
a huge creature.

311
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,352
Do you believe in that?

312
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,370
And, we did try it again just now.

313
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,251
You didn’t exhibit any strange power.

314
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
According to what you’ve said,

315
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,199
it’ll be great if the immortals
can help me out often.

316
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,522
That way, I won’t drag you down.

317
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,879
And I can protect all of you
when you are in danger.

318
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,800
Let’s not think about that.

319
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,479
And we mustn’t tell anyone about this.

320
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,599
If this happens again, our elders
will spread rumours about you.

321
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,080
Maybe they’ll lock you up again.

322
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,799
Xuan Ji, listen.

323
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,359
This is a secret between us.

324
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,239
You mustn’t tell
anyone about this, okay?

325
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,989
- Aunt, Senior Hao Chen.
- Xuan Ji.

326
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,359
It’s good that you’re awake.

327
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,374
I wonder who came to save
you from that Gudiao?

328
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,959
Xuan Ji, Min Yan, what
did you witness in the cave?

329
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,239
I...

330
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,949
The Gudiao knocked us out.

331
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,599
We didn’t see anything.

332
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,868
- Didn’t you say...
- Xuan Ji.

333
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,682
I told you to train harder, right?

334
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:54,582
You were knocked out in an instant
because you were too weak.

335
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,759
And you only woke up after two days.

336
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,759
How could you say that about me?

337
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,638
You didn’t train hard either.

338
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,098
I didn’t train hard?

339
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,698
I’m an expert in
Yang Jue Skill now, you know?

340
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,689
But you were knocked out as well.

341
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,359
I was knocked out because
I wanted to protect you and Ling Long.

342
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,751
- You...
- Stop it.

343
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,320
Aunt, Senior.

344
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,200
Eat now.

345
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,863
Little Six, you’re arguing
with Xuan Ji even though she just woke up.

346
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:24,031
I’ll seal your mouth
if you say anything else.

347
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,124
We were blessed. All of you were safe.

348
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,038
We finished the
Flower Picking Mission as well.

349
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,036
Our sect leader and Lord Dong Fang
had returned after capturing the Tengu.

350
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:39,573
But Hao Chen and I
will check out the mountain.

351
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:42,900
You told me that
there’s a water demon in the cave.

352
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,473
But we didn’t find it when we were there.

353
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,048
I think that demon was trying to help us.

354
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,439
Demons are demons.

355
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,127
They will never help humans.

356
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,448
You mustn’t be cheated
by their appearances.

357
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,400
Seems like someone vanquished
the Gudiao in one blow.

358
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,880
Even my master wasn’t
capable of this feat.

359
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,440
Moreover, Gudiao was a massive beast.

360
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,901
The only ones who
are capable of this feat

361
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,800
are either the immortals or the Asuras.

362
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,319
Aunt Ying Hong, you don’t need to fret.

363
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,638
There are many things

364
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:43,279
that we haven’t witnessed
within the three realms.

365
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,488
But the Asuras were wiped out
1,000 years ago.

366
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,478
Maybe Xuan Ji and the rest were lucky.

367
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,559
They met some immortals
who were trying to help them out.

368
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,520
I hope so.

369
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,759
But it still concerns me, knowing that
such a power had appeared in our realm.

370
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,440
We should be cautious
and notify the other sects as well.

371
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,998
There are no demons in this cave.

372
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,715
Min Yan said the demon either
perished together with the Gudiao,

373
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,076
or had escaped through the water tunnel.

374
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,719
Let’s scout the mountain again.

375
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,975
Okay.

376
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:41,335
Why do I get hungrier every time I eat?

377
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
Where’s my noodles?

378
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,342
Miss, your noodles.

379
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,552
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

380
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,319
Si Feng, you’re awake as well?

381
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,143
I was long awake. You were the only one
who slept for two days.

382
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,040
You must be hungry then.

383
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,319
Come, try this.

384
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,578
This is delicious.

385
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,783
Is this as delicious as the noodles?

386
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,159
You only know how to eat.

387
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,680
This is the medication I’ve made.

388
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,040
Did you make this just for me?

389
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
I made it since I needed it as well.

390
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,421
I didn’t want to owe you a favour.

391
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,479
But, you gave me
the entire bottle.

392
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,954
You gave me the entire bottle

393
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,159
because you were afraid that
it wasn’t enough for me, right?

394
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,120
But, you’re injured as well.

395
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,560
Don’t move.
I’ll apply the medicine for you.

396
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,911
My hand is fine.

397
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:37,284
Let’s go.

398
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,920
I want to visit Mount Lutai again

399
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,861
to see if there’s any remains
of Gudiao’s horns.

400
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,694
Si Feng, wait for me.

401
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,639
You were worried about me as well.

402
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,906
Ling Long and Min Yan said
they wanted to go as well.

403
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,719
Why don’t we go together?

404
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,719
She said that they may lock me up again

405
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,295
if we couldn’t obtain any Weeping Tears.

406
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,807
If that happens,
I won’t be able to see you again.

407
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:05,044
But, don’t worry.

408
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,352
I’ll help you find your mask
before they lock me up again.

409
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,673
Because I know the mask
is very important to you.

410
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,478
Let’s go.

411
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,559
Useless.

412
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,599
You can’t even keep an eye
on a merman.

413
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,999
You better send someone
to retrieve him.

414
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,879
If he speaks in front of the cultivators,

415
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,515
he’ll reveal the secret about
the Sky Hall’s existence.

416
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:36,999
Yes, my lord.

417
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,679
- The person responsible...
- He defeated Gudiao in one blow.

418
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,080
I have never seen someone like
that within the Five Great Sects.

419
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,039
Don’t tell me it’s the God of
War? Or is it the Star of Mosha?

420
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,959
My lord, among all the cultivators,

421
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,143
there’s one who was
not included in the namelist.

422
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:02,647
She’s Chu Ling Long, the daughter
of Shaoyang Sect’s sect leader.

423
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:05,995
According to my investigation,
Chu Ling Long’s birthday

424
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:09,606
was at 9 pm, on the fourth day
of the fourth month 16 years ago.

425
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:13,672
It matches the time of Star of Mosha’s
and God of War’s reincarnation.

426
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:15,553
Chu Ling Long?

427
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,040
Test her out.

428
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,391
Yes, my lord.

429
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,268
There’s nothing left.

430
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,893
There’s nothing left of the Gudiao.

431
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:31,006
How are we supposed to make Weeping Tears?

432
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:32,927
Xuan Ji is done for!

433
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,640
Ling Long, don’t cry.

434
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:38,279
- We’ll think of something.
- Tell me then! I’m desperate!

435
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,619
Ling Long, stop crying.

436
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,079
It’s fine.

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,423
Even if I have to be locked up
in Mingxia Cave again, it’s fine.

438
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:47,888
You dumb girl!

439
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,320
It’s fine even if you can’t
see me for the rest of your life, right?

440
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,028
Ling Long!

441
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,317
Ling Long!

442
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,813
Did I say anything wrong?

443
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,494
Why was she angry with me?

444
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,792
You didn’t want to
be locked up in Mingxia Cave.

445
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:05,233
But why did you say it was fine?

446
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,536
It’s true that I didn’t want to
be locked up in Mingxia Cave,

447
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:12,079
but I didn’t want Ling Long to cry either.

448
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,561
I thought she would feel better
after I told her those words.

449
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:16,940
It’s fine for them to

450
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:20,687
lock me up in Mingxia Cave,
as long as Ling Long doesn’t feel sad.

451
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,208
You’re a dummy indeed.

452
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,213
But I was thinking about this.

453
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,798
If I were to end up in Mingxia Cave again,

454
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,496
I won’t be able to enjoy good food.

455
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:38,177
That’s why I want to eat everything I can
before they send me back.

456
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,234
I’ll buy you anything you want to eat.

457
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,235
- Really?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,143
It’s my compensation
for the lost Gudiao’s horns.

459
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,338
Si Feng, you’re so kind.

460
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,239
Will you buy me anything I want to eat?

461
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,613
Let go of your hand.

462
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,148
Sir, all your dishes are here.

463
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,399
This is too valuable.

464
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,823
- It’s fine.
- We’re a small shop... Keep the change.

465
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,875
Thank you, sir.

466
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,414
Enjoy your meal.

467
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,935
Come, try them.

468
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,279
Si Feng.

469
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,699
Why can’t I smell anything?

470
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,999
Look.

471
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,588
There are so many delicious food.

472
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,509
But I can’t smell them at all.

473
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,760
And now, I can’t identify if the
songs on the street are good or not.

474
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,721
And the colour of the sunset.

475
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,479
And the incoming breezes.

476
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,644
I can’t feel anything.

477
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,365
I’m really envious of other people.

478
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:22,439
They can feel everything.

479
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,790
I’m sure their lives are great.

480
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:35,959
Hey, I think we
should be more careful.

481
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,680
Why? I thought all the demons were slain?

482
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,215
- What was that?
- Let’s check it out.

483
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,121
Capture him!

484
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:54,511
- Go!
- Go!

485
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,520
But people are used to their lives.

486
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,280
They took their senses for granted.

487
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,840
And they forgot the fact that
they enjoy such privileges.

488
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,359
Actually, many feelings are
connected to each other.

489
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,760
Through food, you’ll experience
different feelings as well.

490
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:16,251
This is a sweet snack.

491
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,440
When you eat it,
you’ll feel satisfied.

492
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,249
This is happiness.

493
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,800
This is delicious.

494
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,480
This is lotus seed.

495
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,411
The core is very bitter.

496
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,240
When you eat it, you’ll feel terrible.

497
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,520
Just like how you feel

498
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
when you’re not happy.

499
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Si Feng, this is too bitter for me.
This is terrible.

500
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,319
This is a loquat.

501
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,554
It has a sour and bitter taste.

502
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,679
Some feelings are inexplicable.

503
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,360
Sometimes, you don’t dare to
say the things you want to say.

504
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,880
You can experience those types
of complex feelings

505
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,988
when you eat a loquat.

506
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,072
Si Feng, even though
you’ve told me so much,

507
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,673
I don’t understand a thing.

508
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,499
Si Feng, you’re smiling.

509
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,413
You look great when you smile.

510
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:59,334
Just like the

511
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,518
iced wine.

512
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,292
Although it’s cold from the start,

513
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:08,364
it gets sweet and mesmerising
when you get to taste them.

514
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,645
Si Feng, your smile is just like the wine.

515
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,839
That’s why your smile looks great.

516
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,169
You need to smile more often.
Just like this.

517
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,469
Do you want me to continue or not?

518
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,923
Sometimes,

519
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,002
you want to eat something badly.

520
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:34,443
But you can’t eat it even
when it’s in front of you.

521
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,544
This is what we called as

522
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,750
longing.

523
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,800
Si Feng, after all that you’ve
said, I think I understood something.

524
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,320
But if that’s the case,

525
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,400
it’s even harder for me
to return to Mingxia Cave.

526
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,921
Why aren’t you speaking?

527
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,880
The water demon on Mount Lutai
has been captured!

528
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,799
Come and have a look!

529
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,222
Look at the water demon from Mount Lutai.

530
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,023
We’ve captured the water demon!

531
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,679
Si Feng, I think that’s the demon
we encountered in the cave.

532
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,079
This is a merman.

533
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,399
Merman?

534
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,902
I heard that mermans are great
in weaving cloth and singing.

535
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:04,330
People will be mesmerized by their songs.

536
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:05,783
Are they evil then?

537
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,556
All demons are different.

538
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:14,919
Some demons harm humans
because they want to consume humans

539
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,120
in order to increase their powers.

540
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,716
But mermans are kind and gentle.

541
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:22,357
They won’t harm humans.

542
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,399
Are you crazy? What did you say?

543
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,863
You want to save the demon?

544
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:31,519
Tengu and Gudiao were the demons

545
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,400
that had harmed humans on Mount Lutai.

546
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,565
Mermans have nothing to do with this.

547
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,999
Mermans are kind.

548
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,479
And they’re not aggressive.

549
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,839
He’s innocent.

550
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,360
But he’s a demon. Aren’t all demons evil?

551
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,396
Demons are just like humans.

552
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,480
There are good and evil demons as well.

553
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,839
The merman doesn’t deserve this.

554
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,519
I will try to save him.

555
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,919
You just need to pretend
that you don’t know anything.

556
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,599
The townsfolk said that the
merman was an evil demon.

557
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,878
And they bullied him
and pelted him with stones.

558
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:07,999
But when we were in the mountains,
he didn’t try to harm us at all.

559
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,598
He even tried to help us.

560
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,208
Father said that
everything happens for a reason.

561
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:17,159
Maybe that’s the reason why
fate has lead us to him again.

562
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,920
Si Feng, I’ll follow you and save him.

563
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,159
I can keep watch.

564
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,924
Okay. Count me in.

565
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:27,325
Since I need to take care of Xuan Ji.

566
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,815
Must you save him?

567
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,639
Fine.

568
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,039
I don’t care anymore.

569
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,079
I treat you as my brother.

570
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,640
I won’t stand here and do nothing.

571
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:46,796
I’ll follow you.

572
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,433
Follow me.

573
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,569
We’re here to save you.

574
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,399
Four of you, go and capture the merman.

575
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,102
I’ll meet

576
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,223
Chu Ling Long who’s born
on the 4th day of the 4th month myself.
