<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 1</i>

3
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,119
Since the reordering of Chaos void,
the heavenly realm has ruled over

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,480
the mortal and demon realms.
It’s the head of the three realms.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,567
Yet, more than a thousand years
ago, King Asura became ambitious

6
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,808
and rejected the authority
of heavenly realm.

7
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:54,249
He finally formed the demon ally
and started wars across borders.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,359
The heavenly realm thought
it’s nothing to be afraid of.

9
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,839
Unexpectedly, King Asura
had an extremely powerful general,

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,919
Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu,
who defeated the heavenly army.

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,446
The fellow gods were forced
to retreat to Heavenly Gate.

12
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,759
The Jade Emperor was shocked.

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,119
He and King Bailing dispatched
a lot of soldiers to fight the enemy.

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,607
But they lost.

15
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:19,479
The heavenly realm was in danger

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,480
and the Asuras was about to
turn the three realms upside down.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,679
It’s at this moment that
something shocking happened.

18
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,639
Star of Mosha disappeared
before the final great war.

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,919
At the same time, a saviour
appeared at the heavenly realm.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,844
God of War.

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,159
Her invincibility
got rid of all the Asuras.

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,639
Without Star of Mosha, the demon realm
was no longer powerful.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,159
It’s totally defeated.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,895
The surviving demons are
scattered all over the world.

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,519
Rumour has it that
the death of Star of Mosha

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,919
was plotted by God of War.

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,199
His soul is sealed inside
a mythological object called Jade Cup.

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,839
It’s hidden in an ancient secret area.

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,959
And his primordial spirit
was lost in the chaos.

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
<i>ONE THOUSAND YEARS LATER</i>

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,559
However, things change with time.

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,959
The universe changes every thousand years.

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,879
After a thousand years of rest,
the separated primordial spirit

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,719
is gradually regaining its vitality
and waiting for the reunion.

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,439
And the demon realm is
eagerly waiting for its revival.

36
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,457
It seems that everything isn’t over yet.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,039
If Star of Mosha returns with
the grievance he’s been accumulated,

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
the world will be destroyed.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,692
My lord!

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,319
Elder of Constellation.

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,702
Were you talking about these two stars?

42
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,519
Yes, my lord.

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,319
After Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu died,

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,839
two stars have appeared
faraway in the sky.

45
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,799
They’re Rahu Star and Ketu Star.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,072
For the past thousand years,

47
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,118
they’re located at the south
and north respectively.

48
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,747
They had nothing to do with each other.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
But today,

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,559
these two stars are suddenly
getting closer to one another.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,858
It seems that...

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,517
What?

53
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:25,039
It seems that they’re trying to reunite.

54
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:30,760
Does it mean he’s
really waking up?

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,045
My lord.

56
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,359
That lost primordial spirit
of Star of Mosha

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,639
has appeared in the Fenru City.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,613
My men has looked into it.

59
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,479
Half of that primordial spirit

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,432
will go to the mortal realm for
a tribulation via the channel of karma.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,039
You deities have done wrong and
been stripped of the immortal forms.

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,879
You’re here in the Fenru City

63
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,748
and it’s a chance for you to
reshape your immortal qualities.

64
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,999
Be obedient and head to the mortal realm.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,412
When you successfully
get through the tribulations,

66
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,679
you’ll have the chance to
return to the heavenly realm.

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,599
Consider yourselves lucky!

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,759
Hurry up!

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,079
Drink this Water of Forgetting.
We don’t have all day.

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,199
I’m not drinking it!
I don’t want to leave the heavenly realm!

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,393
I only stole a flat peach.

72
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,834
- I’m not going to the mortal realm!
- There’s nothing to remember.

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,840
It’s just a boring life.

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,290
Forget it.

75
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,710
It’s good to forget it.

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,400
There’s one more thing, my lord.

77
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,799
As far as I know, God
of War and Star of Mosha

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,050
are entering the mortal realm
together for tribulations.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,367
Both of them will be born on the same day,
in the same month and year.

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,748
It’s very interesting.

81
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,839
My lord.

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,839
Both of them are
destined to be enemies.

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,719
Will it ruin our plan of
reviving the demon realm?

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,119
No.

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,919
God of War used the Divine Weapon
of Star of Mosha to seal his soul.

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,039
We need both God of War and
Divine Weapon to save Star of Mosha.

87
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,679
I want both of those kids.

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,516
Go look into it quickly.

89
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:21,079
Find out where God of War
and Star of Mosha will be born.

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,997
Madam, push!

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,159
Yes!

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Push again, Madam!

94
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,839
We’re almost there.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,559
Take a deep breath.

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,799
Madam.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,239
Madam, take a deep breath!

98
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,576
Push!

99
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,119
- Push, Madam!
- It’s been more than two hours.

100
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,158
Why hasn’t this second child come out yet?

101
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,999
Almost there, madam! Push again!

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,880
Is it a difficult labour?

103
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,599
Who are you, demon?

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,760
How dare you break into
the forbidden ground of Fenru City!

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,575
Don’t delay it,
open the channel of karma now!

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,800
Get in now!

107
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,159
Madam.

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,479
It’s out.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,166
It’s coming out, madam!

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,559
It’s out, madam!

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,994
It’s out!

112
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,663
<i>SIXTEEN YEARS LATER</i>

113
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,198
No one thought

114
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,599
madam would give birth to a dead baby
after ten months of pregnancy.

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,239
Sect Leader didn’t want to upset her.

116
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,279
Thus, he buried that child on that night.

117
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,971
No one saw what happened
at that midnight coming.

118
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,759
Ghost!

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,279
What happened?
Why was there a child crying?

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,134
The butler ordered to dig out
the grave of Second Lady.

121
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,439
Guess what happened!

122
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
Senior!

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,449
That child came back to life!

124
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,037
Our little junior took a long time
to take her first breath.

125
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,239
You’re all the disciples of other uncles.

126
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,314
You didn’t know.

127
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,759
Our little junior was born
without the six senses.

128
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,199
- Senior.
- What?

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
What are the six senses?

130
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,628
I’ll tell you what they are.

131
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,908
Sight.

132
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,141
Sound.

133
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,319
Smell.

134
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,559
Taste.

135
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,799
And she’s born without
touch and thought too.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,959
She is, to put it politely, heartless.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,519
To put it otherwise,
she’s a good-for-nothing.

138
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,919
Little Junior is now sixteen.

139
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,279
But she hasn’t even mastered
the first level of Shaoyang mantra.

140
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,719
- Really?
- You’re exaggerating.

141
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,959
Fine. You don’t believe me?

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,159
I’ll show it to you all today. Let’s go.

143
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,353
Sure, let’s go check it out.

144
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,798
Look at her hand!

145
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,879
She really doesn’t feel pain.

146
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,319
Do you believe me now?

147
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,005
Yes, we do now.

148
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:48,039
Second Senior.

149
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,282
Is this yours?

150
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,493
Yes.

151
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,094
- Are you alright?
- I’m alright.

152
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,159
Second Senior. If you want to fool me,

153
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,439
you’ve got to be creative about it.

154
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,359
Are you all scared of this?

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,277
Yes.

156
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:15,318
You can’t feel.

157
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,479
Of course you’re not scared of it.

158
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,919
Xuan Ji!

159
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,479
- Xuan Ji!
- Ling Long!

160
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,159
- Ling Long!
- Xuan Ji!

161
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,599
Come, let me take a look at your hand.

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,679
It’s all red.

163
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,199
- I’m alright.
- Chen Min Jue!

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,198
You!

165
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,239
If you ever bully my sister again,

166
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,319
I’ll ask Father to teach
you a good lesson!

167
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,240
And you! Are you looking for trouble?

168
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,045
My good Junior Ling Long. Don’t get mad.

169
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:39,408
It’s just a joke.

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,119
Enough.

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,919
Ling Long, don’t take it seriously.

172
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,679
I don’t know what pain is anyway.

173
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,239
And I don’t even know how to get mad.

174
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,913
You see, I told you that Little Junior
wouldn’t mind it.

175
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,999
I’m telling you.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,399
If you ever dare bully my sister again,

177
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,639
I’ll ask Master to flog your bottom!

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,834
Enough.

179
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:59,159
Stop fighting.

180
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,559
- Little Six.
- Yes?

181
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,877
- Whose side are you on?
- I...

182
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:08,199
Ling Long, did you forget why
Aunt Ying Hong ask us to come here?

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,559
I almost forgot about it.

184
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,521
- Xuan Ji, I’ve got some good news for you.
- Go ahead.

185
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:14,877
Aunt Hong asked us to serve the sects
during the Flower Picking Session.

186
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:17,239
- Let’s go down the mountain now.
- Ling Long.

187
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,974
This isn’t a good news.

188
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:21,279
Can I not go? I want to take a nap here.

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,871
- I don’t want to join it.
- No way!

190
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:27,239
- No way!
- I’m not joining it!

191
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,319
- Spare me!
- No way!

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,599
The five great sects will gather
for the Flower Picking Session.

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,599
The aces from the other four sects
are coming too.

194
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,239
We can go check out
those handsome men first.

195
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,399
Let’s go.

196
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,719
You’re acting improperly.

197
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,879
And you’re trying to influence Xuan Ji.

198
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,173
What are you talking about?

199
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,359
I’m already sixteen.

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,559
Aunt Hong said
I can look at whoever I like.

201
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,199
Xuan Ji will turn sixteen this year.

202
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,599
We can look at whoever we want.

203
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
Let’s go, Xuan Ji.

204
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,981
I...

205
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,261
To test it with
such a powerful demon wolf.

206
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,546
Isn’t it a bit too risky?

207
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,348
Si Feng.

208
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,199
That’s why you’re my descendant.

209
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,839
Only Yu Si Feng passed this set of test.

210
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,556
As of the remaining disciples...

211
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,589
Please spare us, Palace Lord!

212
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,239
Lize Palace doesn’t take in
good-for-nothings.

213
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,319
Let’s do it the old way then.

214
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,239
Get rid of their skills and
chase them out of here.

215
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,714
Please spare us, Palace Lord!

216
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,748
Enough!

217
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:57,084
You said Si Feng can’t be
the first disciple of Lize Palace

218
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,381
because he’s still young.

219
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,799
But he’s so gifted.

220
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,439
If not he, then who?

221
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,169
When Si Feng wins the
Shaoyang’s Flower Session, I will

222
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,253
grant him the Gold Feather Medallion

223
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,659
and let him take over the Lize Palace.

224
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,968
Since you’ve made up your
mind, we shall obey you.

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,119
We’re leaving for the Mount Shaoyang
for Flower Session in a few days.

226
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,537
For many of you, it’ll be
your first time leaving the palace.

227
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:37,159
I’m reminding you.

228
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,719
What is the first rule
of leaving the palace?

229
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,439
Never take off our masks
in front of outsiders!

230
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,359
I’m glad that you remember it.

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,199
You know very well the
consequences of breaking the rule.

232
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,108
Yes!

233
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,378
Si Feng, let’s see who
gets to Shaoyang first.

234
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,599
My lord.

235
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,399
Is there still no news?

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,999
We lost God of War and Star of Mosha
at Fenru City sixteen years ago.

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,156
And you haven’t found anything since then!

238
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,127
Please don’t get mad, my lord.

239
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,799
I’ve just found out the whereabouts of
Yuntian Loop and Chehai Hook.

240
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
But...

241
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,167
But it’s not easy to get hold of them.

242
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:49,856
My lord.

243
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,413
It has to do with Wu Zhi Qi.

244
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:59,279
Since they’re with my old
friend, I should meet up with him.

245
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,119
I’ll try my best to sneak our men
into the five sects.

246
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,323
The quadrennial Flower Session
will be held in Shaoyang.

247
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,439
If those two kids are among the crowd,

248
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,919
their unusual powers will be shown
before everyone. And they can’t hide them.

249
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,599
Star of Mosha and God of War

250
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,560
entered the channel on the fourth of
4th month, between 9 to 11 at night.

251
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,479
That’s when they’re born.

252
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,599
Remember.

253
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,759
Don’t miss out any child
who’s born between 9 to 11 at night.

254
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,999
Yes.

255
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:32,599
<i>SHAOYANG</i>

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,079
My fellow seniors from Xuanyuan Sect,
you’ll be staying at Tianzi Pavilion.

257
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,359
Please.

258
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,517
Show the seniors the way.

259
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:39,958
Yes.

260
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,239
Xuan Ji!

261
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,709
Pull yourself up!

262
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,479
We’re the representatives of Shaoyang.

263
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,476
You can’t embarrass Father.

264
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,793
Yes.

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,814
Do you really not want to stay here?

266
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,759
Forget about it, go ahead.

267
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,867
You wouldn’t even
know if you catch a cold.

268
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,719
These are the dog blood for the sacrifice.

269
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,685
Take them home.

270
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,724
Can you do it?

271
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,842
Yes.

272
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,085
Open your eyes and look at it.

273
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:15,639
Even if you don’t know me,

274
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,719
surely you recognise the sword
made by Dianqinggu Sect.

275
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,749
- You can’t enter without a plaque.
- Stop fighting!

276
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,578
You can talk to me.

277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,727
Who are you?

278
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:35,599
I’m the Shaoyang sect leader’s
daughter, Chu Ling Long.

279
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,719
Am I important enough to talk to you?

280
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,839
Ling Long.

281
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,119
This Dianqinggu sect member
insists on entering without a plaque.

282
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,039
You’ll go in only when the elder
of your sect confirms your identity.

283
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,589
- Next.
- What if I insist on going in?

284
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,439
I’m sorry.
You can’t enter without a plaque.

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,821
You rude lass.

286
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,959
Are you messing with me?

287
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,892
Fine, look at this.

288
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,809
Ling Long!

289
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,431
I’m alright.

290
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:06,879
Now that I’ve shown you the plaque,
can I enter now?

291
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,561
You think you can brush me off
with your trivial kungfu?

292
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,239
Any one of our sect members can beat you.

293
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,159
Don’t waste your time
trying to get into it!

294
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,719
Do you think you’re
able to stop me?

295
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,356
How impolite you are!

296
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,661
Don’t come close to my sister!

297
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,211
Xuan Ji!

298
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:25,079
You said anyone can beat me.

299
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,359
Does it include this lass?

300
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,433
Fine, I’m curious to know
how powerful Shaoyang Sect is!

301
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,801
Xuan Ji!

302
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:36,959
Xuan Ji!

303
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,439
- Let go of my sister! Xuan Ji!
- What do we do?

304
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,353
Let go of me! Xuan Ji!

305
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,930
Pull out your sword.

306
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,279
What for?

307
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,279
I don’t want to fight with you.

308
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,079
Pull out your sword
or I’ll let go my hand.

309
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,879
Don’t let go!

310
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,479
I don’t know how to use a sword.

311
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,199
I’ll fall down if you let go.

312
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,199
Are you kidding me?
Didn’t you brag about yourself?

313
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,879
How dare Shaoyang Sect call itself
powerful with a good-for-nothing like you.

314
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,564
I’ll show you what being powerful means.

315
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,919
Aren’t you scared?
Cry if you’re scared.

316
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,079
Cry and call yourself a good-for-nothing.

317
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,439
And I’ll let you down.

318
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,559
I was born without the ability to cry.

319
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,679
Have you had enough fun yet?

320
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,070
If so, let me go. I’m sleepy.

321
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,639
Fine, since you refuse to bow down to me,

322
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,728
let’s play a more exciting game.

323
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:51,119
What do I do? I’ll die for sure if I fall.

324
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,240
And Father will call me
an embarrassment again.

325
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,839
What are you doing?

326
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,119
Your clothes are dirty.
I’ll clean it for you.

327
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,715
Don’t touch me!

328
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:44,319
Senior, are you here
for the Flower Session?

329
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,239
I’m the disciple of Shaoyang Sect.

330
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,159
But I don’t know how I ended up here.

331
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,757
Could you send me back?

332
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:52,999
Send me back.

333
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,080
When I get back, I’ll wash off
this dog blood for you.

334
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,561
No need.

335
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,799
What do you want?

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,679
Why do you talk like this?

337
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,199
Boring.

338
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,439
Wait a second.

339
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,719
Senior.

340
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,084
I really don’t know how I ended up here.

341
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,839
And I don’t know how to fly.
I can’t go back there.

342
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,359
Walk back then.

343
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,519
No!

344
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,640
It’s too tiring!

345
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,851
I’ve never met such
a lazy cultivator like you.

346
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,239
Where is my sister? Say it!

347
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,599
I don’t know where she fell!

348
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,079
She’s so stupid that
she can’t even stand on a sword.

349
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,199
You are stupid! You’ve lost my sister!

350
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,159
How could you talk like this?

351
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,399
- Have you found Xuan Ji?
- Not yet.

352
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,359
We have yet to search
that dense forest of Shengyun Valley.

353
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,559
Its terrain is complicated.
Sometimes there are demons lurking there.

354
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,103
We’re short-handed and need more people.

355
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,199
I’ll go tell Father now.

356
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,959
- Nothing can happen to her.
- Ling Long.

357
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,519
Xuan Ji!

358
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,358
Are you alright?

359
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,599
This kind and powerful senior saved me.

360
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,519
Great! You must be
a senior from Lize Palace.

361
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,480
You look like gentleman,
unlike that man who is a bully!

362
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,519
Thank you, Brother.

363
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,999
I’d like to enter.

364
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
May I register now?

365
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Lize Palace, Yu Si Feng.

366
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,599
I’m quite curious.

367
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,719
You disciples of Lize Palace
wear your masks all the time.

368
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,840
What are you hiding behind them?

369
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,399
What?

370
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,006
Want to fight with me?

371
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,260
Bring it on!

372
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,617
I’m not interested in it.

373
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,958
Everyone is waiting to enter
the Shaoyang Sect.

374
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,307
I see, a little stammer
has saved a little idiot.

375
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,102
That’s very interesting!

376
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,999
I heard that the disciples of
Lize Palace rarely meet women.

377
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,359
You carried this little idiot
all the way back here.

378
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,759
How did it feel like?

379
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,224
Wu Tong, are you
looking for trouble again?

380
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:17,999
- I’ll your mouth apart!
- No!

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,959
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

382
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,239
- You...
- What’s going on?

383
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,479
What are you arguing about?

384
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,977
- Aunt.
- Aunt.

385
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,239
Master.

386
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,959
I accidentally lost the plaque.

387
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,359
While waiting to enter the Shaoyang Sect,

388
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,639
I’ve pulled a prank on the juniors.

389
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,479
I’m afraid they’re not happy about it.

390
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,760
What prank? You call that a prank?

391
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,061
- You...
- Wu Tong.

392
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,279
You shouldn’t have done so.

393
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,319
Apologise to the daughters
of Sect Leader Chu.

394
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,552
Yes. I was wrong, Master.

395
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,999
Juniors, I apologise.

396
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,320
I didn’t ask you to apologise!

397
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,405
We’re all the disciples of five sects.

398
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:03,378
We’re all brothers and sisters.

399
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,079
I hope we can help
each other in the future.

400
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,720
You’re right, Elder Chu.

401
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,359
Come with me now.

402
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,600
Yes.

403
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,839
Aunt, how could we
let them go just like that?

404
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,359
Did you know how he bullied Sister?

405
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,284
Thanks to Yu Si Feng
from Lize Palace. He...

406
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,831
He’s left?

407
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,679
Xuan Ji. Did you know? That Yu Si Feng

408
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,959
is the most promising disciple
in Lize Palace.

409
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,719
But their palace rule is to
put on their masks every day.

410
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,239
We don’t know what they look like.

411
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,039
But I bet he’s definitely good-looking.

412
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,879
- Good-looking?
- Yes.

413
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,959
I bet he’s definitely ugly-looking.

414
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
Why would he wear his mask all the time?

415
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,960
You’re just being jealous.

416
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,479
What a coincidence!

417
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,999
- What?
- Look.

418
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,839
Yu Si Feng and I

419
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
were born in the same year and month,
and on the same day.

420
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,280
It’s true.

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,399
Walk back then.

422
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,359
No!

423
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,418
It’s too tiring!

424
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:55,199
Chu Xuan Ji.

425
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,279
You’re just a lazybones
who sleeps all day!

426
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,319
And you don’t do what you should do!

427
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,079
You’re already sixteen.

428
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,279
But you can’t even summon a sword.

429
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,525
If word gets out, Shaoyang
Sect will be shamed!

430
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,242
Mother!

431
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,959
- Why are you crying?
- Mother!

432
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,468
If you’re watching us from down there,

433
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,439
look at how Father is scolding Xuan Ji!

434
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,559
You’ll be very upset for sure!

435
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,279
You...

436
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,879
Mother said

437
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,599
she just wanted Xuan Ji
to live a steady life.

438
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,519
She didn’t expect her
to be skilled in martial arts.

439
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,639
Did you forget about that?

440
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,799
Xuan Ji is acting this way because
she’s born without the six senses.

441
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,599
She didn’t ask for it.

442
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,520
Who could understand her pain?

443
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,768
Alright, Ling Long.

444
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,603
Mother!

445
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,638
If you insist on punishing Xuan
Ji, I’ll keep crying to Mother!

446
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,959
Okay, forget about it. Stop crying.

447
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,605
There’s a reason why she’s dull.

448
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:11,159
But it can’t be an excuse
for you to be a lazybones.

449
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,799
Let’s do this.

450
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
You have ten days

451
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,279
to master the first
Yaohua sword moves.

452
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,979
If you don’t work hard and
master it, I’ll teach you a lesson.

453
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,439
Okay.

454
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,359
I knew it’d work.
Father can’t do anything about us

455
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
whenever I cry to Mother.

456
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,817
But Ling Long, this
is indeed useful.

457
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,439
This is the most important weapon.

458
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,719
It works not only on Father.

459
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,639
If your future lover dotes on you,

460
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,759
he can’t do anything about you
when you cry.

461
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,279
Is that so?

462
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,119
But I don’t have this.

463
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,129
I think tears are the most precious
thing in the world, aren’t they?

464
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,759
When you got mad today,

465
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,279
did your eyes feel tingly
that you felt like crying?

466
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,719
I did feel quite angry.

467
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,439
But I thought I didn’t need to
take them seriously.

468
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,199
As long as you’re happy.

469
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,759
Instead of taking them seriously,
I’d rather go take a nap.

470
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,400
Then do you...

471
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,839
Little Six.

472
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,518
Are you here to send us the birthday cake?

473
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,879
I’m the sender.

474
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,759
But Master was the one
who asked to prepare it.

475
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,799
This is Bazhen cake.
And it’s made from eight ingredients.

476
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,079
It’s true that Father is fierce.
But he dotes on us.

477
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,559
Let’s eat now.

478
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,770
Xuan Ji.

479
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,399
It’s so delicious.

480
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,599
Xuan Ji, it’s such a shame
that you can’t taste it.

481
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,999
Can you not bring that up?

482
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,279
It’s okay if I can’t taste it.

483
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,999
As long as Ling Long
enjoys eating it, I’m happy.

484
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,719
Our Xuan Ji is such a good girl.
But Father isn’t satisfied with her.

485
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,080
Jeez!

486
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,562
Today is that
little stammer’s birthday too!

487
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,560
Si Feng?

488
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,242
Si Feng!

489
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,599
Is Si Feng around?

490
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,959
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

491
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
- Someone is looking for you.
- Si Feng!

492
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,279
Why are you looking for me?

493
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,399
Little Stammer, you forgot your plaque.

494
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,846
I came to return it to you.

495
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,839
Anything else?

496
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,719
- Oh yeah, Little Stammer.
- I’m not Little Stammer.

497
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,359
Then why do you
stumble over three words?

498
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,390
None of your business.

499
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,439
You can stumble over two words too.

500
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,519
Just leave if there’s nothing else.

501
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,839
Here’s the thing, miss.

502
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,559
Si Feng has always stayed in Lize Palace.
And he’s new to Zhongyuan.

503
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,199
He’s not so fluent in Zhongyuan language.
I hope you don’t mind.

504
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,759
I’ll leave you two to it.

505
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,399
I see.

506
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,959
I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Chu Xuan Ji.

507
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,919
Thank you for saving and
sending me back to Shaoyang.

508
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,479
You’re the first best friend
I made outside Shaoyang.

509
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,079
Today is our birthday.

510
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,719
Therefore, I’ve brought you
a birthday cake.

511
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,599
We share the same birthday.
Ling Long said fate brought us together.

512
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,119
What fate?

513
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,559
Stop talking nonsense.

514
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,319
We’re not friends.

515
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,926
And I never eat birthday cakes.

516
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,451
I’ve finally found a peach tree.

517
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,469
And there’s morning dew.

518
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,719
Where’s Xuan Ji? Master asked me
to teach her Yaohua sword moves.

519
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,919
Why is she nowhere to be seen?

520
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,797
She must be taking a nap somewhere.

521
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,519
It’s wrong to steal bird eggs.

522
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,842
Get it?

523
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,729
It’s you again.

524
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,039
It’s you, Little Stammer.

525
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,690
Why is it always you?

526
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,159
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to knock over your tea.

527
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,599
There’s a mountain spring.
I’ll go fetch you some water.

528
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,137
- Wait for me.
- No need.

529
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,479
Peach dew.

530
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,599
Buddha’s hand.

531
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,839
Pine nut.

532
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,119
They make triple purity drink.

533
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,119
A cup a day helps one’s cultivation.

534
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,844
I’m not drinking if it’s not peach dew.

535
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,477
Why are you being so particular?

536
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:20,839
It’s just tea. Is there any difference?

537
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,219
I’ve never met

538
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,679
a lazybones like you.

539
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,039
And you know nothing.

540
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,479
And you’re poor at spell casting.

541
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,879
No wonder you get bullied.

542
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,439
You’re useless.

543
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,650
You...

544
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,199
I’m useless.

545
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,199
But I didn’t mean to knock over your tea.

546
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,719
I saw a bad snake which
tried to steal bird eggs.

547
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,113
I wanted to catch it.
And I accidentally...

548
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,804
It’s that bad snake again!

549
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,991
Let go! Let go of it!

550
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,529
This is my spirit beast.

551
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,679
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pinch it.

552
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,887
Is it dead?

553
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,159
Tell me.

554
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,550
Why

555
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,079
did you pinch it?

556
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,058
Because it came to me.

557
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,617
I thought it’d bite me for sure.

558
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,731
Don’t mimic the way I talk.

559
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,239
What do we do then?

560
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,999
Should I let my father have a look at it?

561
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,096
He might be able to save it.

562
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,240
Silver Snake!

563
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,539
Silver Snake!

564
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:59,747
Where are you, Silver Snake?

565
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,440
Silver Snake!

566
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,239
Why is your spirit beast so disobedient?

567
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,520
My father’s shows itself
at once when we call it.

568
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,173
It’s still young and immature.

569
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,424
Don’t talk bad about it.

570
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,478
I feel it’s being attracted by something.

571
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,683
This peach forest is strange indeed.

572
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,599
We’ve been looking for Silver Snake.

573
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,799
But it’s nowhere to be found.

574
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,045
There...

575
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:43,901
There’s something wrong
about this peach forest.

576
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,479
Little Stammer.

577
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,085
Do you feel hot?

578
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,669
I... I don’t.

579
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,050
Don’t you?

580
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:22,919
Little Stammer.

581
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,359
We’re of the same age.

582
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,525
But why are you so knowledgeable?

583
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,418
Stop talking.

584
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,003
This formation is difficult.

585
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,679
Why are we here on the lake surface?

586
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,591
Little Stammer, are you alright?

587
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,199
This isn’t a lake surface.

588
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,839
There’s a barrier here.

589
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,050
Barrier?

590
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,199
It’s really a barrier.

591
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,439
I know why there’s
a peach formation out there.

592
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,039
This is the secret ground
of Shaoyang Sect.

593
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,566
How did we end up here?

594
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,959
How do we get in?

595
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,839
I don’t know. Shaoyang Sect disciple
aren’t allowed to come near here.

596
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,279
I want to enter it.

597
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,399
No way!

598
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,935
This is the forbidden ground
of Shaoyang Sect.

599
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,853
Without Father’s permission,
you can’t set foot in it.

600
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,679
Are you alright, Little Stammer?

601
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,639
How do we open it?

602
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,319
I don’t know.

603
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,959
We shouldn’t be here.

604
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,639
- Let’s go now.
- We’re running out of time!

605
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,999
I’m connected to my spirit animal.

606
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,156
Silver Snake has
been attracted into it.

607
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:15,399
If I don’t save it,
it’ll be in danger!

608
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,479
Open it!

609
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,927
Let’s head back and ask for help.

610
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:21,919
- What do you think?
- We’re running out of time!

611
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I...

612
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,279
I can do nothing about it.
I’m so poor at spell casting.

613
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,839
This is the most ancient barrier

614
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,359
set by the most powerful elder
in our sect.

615
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,519
There’s no way I can open it.

616
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,831
Watch it.

617
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,840
It’s open.

618
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,982
How did I open it?

619
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,759
- Open it!
- No way!

620
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,759
If my father finds out, I’m dead meat.

621
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,359
Chu Xuan Ji!

622
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,234
Silver Snake is dying!

623
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,163
I...

624
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,159
We’ll come out after saving Silver Snake.

625
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,599
Your father won’t find out about it.

626
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,850
Won’t he? I’ll...

627
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,279
Okay. You helped me once.

628
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,080
I’ll help you this once.

629
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,759
There’s something powerful in there.

630
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,199
Don’t come in no matter what.

631
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,191
Okay. Hurry up.

632
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,880
Silver Snake.

633
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:53,467
Silver Snake!

634
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,560
Silver Snake!

635
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:05,149
Silver Snake!

636
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,148
Silver Snake!

637
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,333
Silver Snake.

638
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,119
Little Stammer!

639
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,518
Little Stammer!

640
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:18,723
Little Stammer!

641
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:26,021
Little Stammer!

642
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,679
Don’t you bully Little Stammer!

643
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,678
Don’t hit Little Stammer! Let go of him!

644
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,959
Shut up!

645
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,720
- Why did you come in here?
- I’m here to save you, Little Stammer.

646
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,097
Run!

647
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,479
Are you alright, Little Stammer?

648
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,639
This is Candle Dragon.

649
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,759
It’s very powerful.

650
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
You can’t save me.

651
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,839
Run!

652
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,891
Is it powerful? Let’s run together then!

653
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,946
Little Stammer!

654
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:11,320
Little Stammer!

655
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,106
Little Stammer!

656
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:16,359
Are you alright, Little Stammer?

657
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,733
Little Stammer!

658
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,126
You’re bleeding.

659
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:42,599
Little Stammer.

660
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,479
You’re alright.

661
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,199
Little Stammer.

662
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,359
Thank God you’re okay.

663
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,080
Little Stammer.

664
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,600
Thank God you’ve woken up.

665
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,618
My... My mask.

666
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,479
It’s missing!

667
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,559
Your face was bleeding.
That’s why I took your mask off.

668
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,424
- Where’s the mask?
- The mask is over there.
