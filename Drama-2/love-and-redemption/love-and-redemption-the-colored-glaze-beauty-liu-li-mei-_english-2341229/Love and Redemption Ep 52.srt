00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,228
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,680
<i>EPISODE 52</i>

3
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:38,780
Because I’m afraid.

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,380
I’m afraid that you’ll look for me,

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
yet I’m afraid that you wouldn’t come.

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,020
I wanted to return to the past with you,

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,220
yet I’m afraid that everything

8
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,407
would disappear just like a bubble.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,829
If that’s the case,

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,317
I would rather not see you.

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,140
Why would that happen?

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,319
Si Feng, believe me.

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,300
From now on, we’ll be together

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,300
forever.

15
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,785
We will be together.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,380
We will never be apart.

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,174
We will be together forever.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,060
Now, I finally understand.

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,986
Eternity

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,813
is too far away from us.

21
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,890
I don’t dare to imagine that.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,900
But, at least
we can cherish our days together.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,719
Si Feng, believe me.

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,660
Don’t worry.
I’ll undo your Loveless Curse for you.

25
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,262
Si Feng.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,500
Why did the feather mark disappear?

27
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,260
Because...

28
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:51,232
Because the Loveless Curse is gone.

29
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,559
I don’t know how long I can survive.

30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,978
I mustn’t ruin Xuan Ji’s future.

31
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,009
Si Feng.

32
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:21,193
Do you know that

33
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,300
I’ve traveled everywhere

34
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,954
in order to look for you?

35
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:30,693
Guess where I’ve been to?

36
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,500
I’m sure it’s the places
that we went before.

37
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,625
How did you know?

38
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,406
Because I went to the same places

39
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,164
and reminisced our past there.

40
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,060
Si Feng, do you feel that

41
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,754
I deserved

42
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,155
everything?

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,785
Not at all.

44
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,780
I know you cared for me.

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
And you looked everywhere for me.

46
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:07,178
Now, I feel smug.

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,660
Don’t think too highly of yourself.

48
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,776
Listen, if you dare to run
away again, I’ll ignore you.

49
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,380
You told me that you’ll follow my wish

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,799
when you tried to coax me earlier.

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,220
Were you lying to me?

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,186
Si Feng,

53
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,620
you’ve been to many places.

54
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,340
Why did you decide to stay here?

55
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,154
Don’t tell me it’s because of that Ah Lan?

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,550
No.

57
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,327
I’ll tell you the details in the future.

58
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:55,820
But I want to know what happened
in the past two years.

59
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,340
I want to know what you were up to.

60
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,420
I want to know if
you’ve met any other girls

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,340
other than Ah Lan.

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,945
No.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,692
Xuan Ji, actually,

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,900
I missed you every day.

65
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,078
I wondered what you were up to every day.

66
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,399
I wondered you were happy or not.

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,340
I wondered if you’ve met
someone better than me.

68
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,140
I’ve found the best person in the world.

69
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,638
As for this hairpin,

70
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,300
I actually asked Miss Ah Lan
to repair it for me.

71
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,639
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,220
I was upset for nothing.

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,519
I’ve finally made you jealous.

74
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,180
This hairpin has made a huge contribution.

75
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,041
Anyway, you mustn’t give this hairpin
to anyone else in the future.

76
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,719
Not even for repairs.

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,220
If not, I won’t let you off.

78
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,820
I don’t dare to do so
when you’re so fierce.

79
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,088
Here, I’ll put it on for you.

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,351
This is great.

81
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,140
Everything is just like the past now.

82
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Oh yeah, Si Feng, I’ve been
meaning to ask you something.

83
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,032
What exactly happened

84
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,440
when you saved me in the secret ground?

85
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,834
Why can’t I remember anything?

86
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,780
You were hurt by
Jade Cup’s malignant aura.

87
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,914
And you fell unconscious.

88
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,919
Of course you don’t remember anything.

89
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,613
How did you get there in time then?

90
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,914
How did you know I wasn’t
able to destroy the Jade Cup?

91
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,380
It’s just a guess.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,933
Think about it.

93
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:07,314
If the soul within the Jade Cup

94
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,751
could be destroyed easily, the
heavens would’ve acted long ago.

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,320
They don’t need to wait
1,000 years for it.

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,519
But I feel like something

97
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,079
was beckoning me when I was
trying to destroy the Jade Cup.

98
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,077
And when I tried to
destroy it, I felt terrible.

99
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,197
I feel like

100
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,180
I was related to Star of Mosha somehow.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,139
You defeated Star of Mosha personally.

102
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,318
Of course you feel familiar with it.

103
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
There’s nothing strange about that.

104
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,860
That’s not the case.

105
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,306
Actually, I’ve thought about this too.

106
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,260
There are so many brave warriors
in the heavens.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,039
But why did they only send God of War
to face the incoming Asuras?

108
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,940
Every immortal in the
heavens has their own past.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,060
Some were cultivators in their past lives.

110
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,140
Some became immortals after
absorbing the essence of heaven and earth.

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
But what about the God of War?

112
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,674
What’s her past?

113
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,336
How did she become the God of War?

114
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,851
Xuan Ji,

115
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,180
don’t overthink stuff.

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,561
Star of Mosha is trying to control you.

117
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,239
It’s trying to bewitch you.

118
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,540
You should never
go near the Jade Cup again,

119
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,556
understood?

120
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,319
Yes.

121
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,128
I’m just curious.

122
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,191
Promise me this.

123
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,340
Let’s spend the rest
of our lives in peace.

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,900
And forget about the past.

125
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:57,976
Don’t pursue them any longer,

126
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,901
okay?

127
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,919
Si Feng?

128
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,381
Si Feng, what’s wrong?

129
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:13,015
Why do I feel like
you’re much weaker now?

130
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,300
I sustained some injuries while
I tried to seal the Jade Cup.

131
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,366
It’s fine.

132
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,533
Really?

133
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,119
Yes.

134
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,411
It’s just a minor injury.

135
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
Si Feng,

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,020
please don’t hide anything from me

137
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,140
no matter what happens.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,333
I don’t want you to suffer in silence.

139
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,674
I don’t want you to suffer alone.

140
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,224
Okay.

141
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,540
Xuan Ji, you should rest now.

142
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,170
It’s late.

143
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,479
You’re here because of the
Glacial Pool and the Snow Lingzhi.

144
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,559
You borrowed the powers
of Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook.

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,559
And saved Xuan Ji by sealing the Jade Cup.

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,120
But your body can’t withstand
their immense power.

147
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,453
If I’m not mistaken,

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,740
it triggers much faster
than the Loveless Curse.

149
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,380
The weapons are still inside your body.
They’re torturing you, am I right?

150
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,938
So, you avoided Xuan Ji because
you thought you will die soon.

151
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,239
Why did you do that?

152
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,780
You do know everything.

153
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,079
Wu Zhi Qi told me that

154
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,341
with my powers, I can only
survive one year at most.

155
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,119
I didn’t expect myself

156
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,940
to survive until this day.

157
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,004
That Glacial Pool saved you.

158
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,504
I remembered something
while I was on my way here.

159
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,306
Rumor has it that

160
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:27,319
there’s a freezing pool at the end
of the land of Xigu.

161
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,719
And there’s a super rare Snow Lingzhi
that grows around that part.

162
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,599
I guess that Snow Lingzhi
can temporarily suppress

163
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,195
the powers of Juntian Loop and
Chehai Hook in your body.

164
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:36,034
That’s why you chose to settle down here.

165
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,399
If you’re lucky, when
the Snow Lingzhi

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,719
grows into a Nine Rings Lingzhi,

167
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,740
maybe it can fuse the two weapons
into your body when you consume it.

168
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,780
How is it then?
Did you find the Snow Lingzhi?

169
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,889
I’m always

170
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,719
unlucky.

171
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,860
The Snow Lingzhi is
only a small sprout.

172
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,879
For it to grow into a
Nine Rings Lingzhi, maybe

173
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,028
I’ll have to wait 1,000 years.

174
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,436
It did grow.

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,159
Gods

176
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,180
are still on my side.

177
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,616
The Demon Citadel
has been in ruins for over 1,000 years.

178
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,839
I wonder if
the ancient records still exist?

179
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,980
We found nothing after a long search.

180
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,239
The Demon Citadel is a huge place.

181
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,020
Don’t give up yet.
Let’s continue our search.

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,349
Ruo Yu, look!

183
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,704
Ancient records?

184
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,580
All the ancient records are here!

185
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,199
I’m sure this is the library
of King Asura!

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,559
No one was able to come
due to the strong malignant aura.

187
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,380
I’m sure this place
will provide us the solution.

188
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,759
Let’s split up and search.

189
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,008
Okay.

190
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,799
Are you okay?

191
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,159
I’m fine.

192
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,100
This place is collapsing.
You better be careful.

193
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,380
Spirit Beasts of the World?

194
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,860
Is there a way to terminate
my blood contract?

195
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,479
It does exist! In the book,

196
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,279
it states that there’s a type of moth
that lived around the Calamity Pool.

197
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,439
If their cocoons absorb the
blood of the spirit beast’s master,

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,199
they’ll follow the blood
of the spirit beast

199
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,679
and terminate the blood contract.

200
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,079
This is great!

201
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,453
Let me see.

202
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,140
But why were the other pages torn down?

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,501
Here.

204
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,234
It stated that if you want
the moth to turn into cocoons,

205
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,936
you need to feed them with rare herbs.

206
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:49,170
Rare herbs? I guess
it means something like Lingzhi.

207
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,559
Isn’t that easy?

208
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,518
The most important thing now
is to find the moths.

209
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,668
It’s stated in the book as well.

210
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,461
Calamity Pool is their habitat.

211
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,839
- Let’s look for them!
- But Silver Snake,

212
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,900
don’t you think this is too much
of a coincidence?

213
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:06,199
And why were the other pages torn down?

214
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Maybe we’re missing out
on some vital information.

215
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,044
I’m sure it’s not that dangerous.

216
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,788
Anyway, everything is stated in the book.

217
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,759
We should find the moths
before anything else.

218
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,596
- Let’s go.
- Wait.

219
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,978
Okay. Let’s go.

220
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,131
Let’s go.

221
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,719
Yu Si Feng, you spoiled my plan.

222
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,479
I will never let you live in peace!

223
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,724
You want to use the Snow Lingzhi
to save yourself?

224
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:35,875
In your dreams!

225
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,529
Where exactly are they?

226
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,336
Ruo Yu, let’s look over there.

227
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,389
Silver Snake, you mustn’t go there!

228
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,930
That’s the Calamity Pool.
The water will corrode your body!

229
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,837
Stay here if you’re afraid.
I need to find them no matter what.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,398
Silver Snake!

231
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,079
Ruo Yu, are you okay?

232
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,700
- I’m fine.
- I didn’t ask you to save me!

233
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,973
Seems like we can’t find any of them here.

234
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:09,132
Let’s take a look over there.

235
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,687
Ruo Yu, look!

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,053
Is this the moth’s larva?

237
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,639
Seems like they fit the bill.

238
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,945
This is great!

239
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,799
Ruo Yu, look!

240
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,070
Look what I’ve found!

241
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,379
Lingzhi?

242
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,300
I thought you went to gather food?

243
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,488
Calm down.

244
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,383
It’s stated in the book, right?

245
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,887
We need to feed the larvae
with rare herbs.

246
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,869
Only then, they’ll grow and form cocoons.

247
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,403
I’m so lucky.

248
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:21,700
I found this Lingzhi before our food.

249
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,719
Relax. We’ll continue
after I feed them with this.

250
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,159
Lingzhi?

251
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,389
But why is there Lingzhi around this area?

252
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,519
I don’t know either.

253
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
I saw a crow holding it with its beak.

254
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,319
And I grabbed it from that crow.
I’m amazing, right?

255
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,540
A crow?

256
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,479
Silver Snake, don’t you think there’s
something wrong with the crow?

257
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,839
The crow lead us here in the first place.

258
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,180
Now, it even gave you a Lingzhi.

259
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,362
How is that strange?

260
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,663
It’s only a crow. I’m sure
we can defeat it if it’s a foe.

261
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,119
Look!

262
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,799
They finished the Lingzhi already.

263
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,999
Calm down. I’ll get more
rare herbs for you.

264
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,144
Grow up fast and I’ll take you
to Si Feng, okay?

265
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,239
Xuan Ji, how are you?

266
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,041
I wonder where you are right now?

267
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,696
Do you have any news of Si Feng?

268
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,199
All of us missed you.

269
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,119
Father’s birthday is on the 16th.
We’ve invited all the other sects.

270
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,344
I hope you can celebrate it with us.
From Ling Long.

271
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,895
Si Feng!

272
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,400
Si Feng!

273
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,532
Si Feng, Ling Long sent us a letter!

274
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,886
Si Feng?

275
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,019
Si Feng!

276
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,540
Si Feng!

277
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,676
Si Feng!

278
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,159
Si Feng!

279
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,395
Si Feng!

280
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,362
Si Feng!

281
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,620
Ruo Yu, look!
The larvae are turning into cocoons!

282
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,919
Our effort wasn’t in vain.

283
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,559
Now, we just need to let them
absorb Si Feng’s blood.

284
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,182
And the moths will be able
to terminate my blood contract.

285
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,252
Let’s look for Si Feng right now.

286
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,919
But, how do we find Si Feng?

287
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,978
Although I don’t know
if Si Feng has recovered his power,

288
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,639
I can sense him now.

289
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,304
And, although his power is
weak, I can still locate him.

290
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,052
Ruo Yu.

291
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,399
Ruo Yu, although you did help me out,

292
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,860
you’ve hurt Si Feng many times as well.

293
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,799
Maybe he doesn’t want to see you.

294
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,780
Forget it. I think I should go alone.

295
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,552
You’re right.

296
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,893
I’m too ashamed to see Si Feng.

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,636
No one would want to

298
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,180
see a person like me.

299
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,900
But Yan Ran, I’m
worried about you.

300
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,352
Just treat this as my last trip with you.

301
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,376
And one more thing.

302
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,159
This bangle was supposed to be a pair.

303
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,712
I wanted to give one to Ruo Xue
and one to you.

304
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,021
But Ruo Xue is gone now.

305
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,897
I hope you can stay happy on her behalf.

306
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,719
Ruo Yu, I can’t accept that.

307
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,063
You’re really good to me.
Thank you.

308
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,180
But I only have Si Feng in my heart.

309
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,879
You know that.

310
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,182
Of course I know that.

311
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,930
Being good to you is my own business.
It has nothing to do with you.

312
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,239
I treat you like my little sister,
just like Ruo Xue.

313
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,688
Just treat this as a brother’s blessing.

314
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,769
After you terminate your blood contract
with Si Feng,

315
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,097
I will disappear by then.

316
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,914
And I won’t bother you again.

317
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,369
I...

318
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,572
Si Feng!

319
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,232
Si Feng!

320
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,064
Si Feng!

321
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,924
Si Feng!

322
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,354
Si Feng!

323
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,140
Why are you here?

324
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,879
Why is this happening?

325
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,220
Si Feng, what’s wrong?

326
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:25,199
It’s nothing.

327
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,559
It’s nothing? Look at your injuries!

328
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,559
How long do you intend
to hide this from me?

329
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,749
Si Feng!

330
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,835
Xuan Ji, it’s useless.

331
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,167
I’m in this state because
I’ve absorbed Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook

332
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,213
and my body can’t withstand
their power at the moment.

333
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:43,274
I’ll be fine after some time.

334
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,465
Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook?

335
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,859
No wonder.

336
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,920
That’s why you could seal the Jade Cup

337
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,820
even though I couldn’t suppress it.

338
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:58,648
Do you know how powerful
the Star of Mosha is?

339
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,279
You actually withstood
this pain because of me?

340
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,337
And you tell me that it’s a minor injury?
No way that’s a minor injury!

341
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,060
It’s because I overestimated myself.

342
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,980
It’s lucky that I’m
the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

343
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,284
It can’t kill me.

344
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,159
Is that why you made me angry
on purpose and asked me to leave?

345
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,467
Is it because of this?

346
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,759
How could you do that?

347
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,300
Didn’t we agree that
we’ll take on problems together?

348
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,052
Silly girl,

349
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,461
I’m fine since I told you so.

350
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,019
Look.

351
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,319
You see that Snow Lingzhi?

352
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,979
When it matures,

353
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,240
it can merge the powers within me
after I consume it.

354
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,393
Really?

355
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,807
Can that Snow Lingzhi really save you?

356
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,328
Silly girl,

357
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,769
I wouldn’t need to come here
every day if it couldn’t save me.

358
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,940
Stop crying.

359
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:11,374
If you cry, you’ll affect its growth.

360
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,872
By then, it won’t be able to save me.

361
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,540
How is that possible?

362
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,681
You’re lying.

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,375
There’s a golden ring

364
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,100
on the top of the Lingzhi.

365
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,159
Yes.

366
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,060
This is the rare Nine Rings Lingzhi.

367
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,220
I was lucky to discover it.

368
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,700
It takes 1,000 years for it to sprout,
to grow roots,

369
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:40,973
and to mature.

370
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,820
And the Lingzhi will mature this year.

371
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,820
It will be able to save me
once it matures.

372
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,130
You can rest at ease now.

373
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,504
Si Feng,

374
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,900
if you want me to care for you,

375
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,625
you need to forget about
your worries first.

376
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,140
You can’t just ask me to change

377
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,991
without changing yourself.

378
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,199
I was silly then.

379
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,540
I won’t do this in the future.

380
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,953
Lord God of War, it’s all my fault.

381
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,449
In the past,

382
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,700
you always protected me.

383
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,659
From now on,

384
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,620
I’ll protect you.

385
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,199
Lord Flying Snake?

386
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,570
Lord Flying Snake,
I didn’t know you were here!

387
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:14,891
Please forgive me!

388
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,425
Keep it down!

389
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,466
I will be done for
if Green Dragon hears about this!

390
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,780
But, Lord Flying Snake!

391
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,097
Lord Flying Snake,
you don’t need to panic.

392
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:26,519
The Four Sacred Beasts and
Lord Winged Dragon

393
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,740
were sent to the mortal realm
by King Bailing.

394
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,386
You almost scared me to death.

395
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,096
That was close.

396
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,767
Why did King Bailing
send them to the mortal realm?

397
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,359
I heard that he ordered them
to slay demons.

398
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,967
Slay demons?

399
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,450
What demons?

400
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:46,142
I think it’s those who were
connected to God of War.

401
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,389
God of War?

402
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,228
- You are dismissed.
- Okay.

403
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,992
He actually sent those people down there?

404
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:00,473
Don’t tell me King Bailing wants
to hunt down the stinky woman?

405
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,548
This is bad. I need to rush there.

406
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,225
Yu’Er, did you finish your homework?

407
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,686
I’ve bought you some food!

408
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,182
Why are you flying?

409
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,199
Where did you thieves come from?

410
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,359
How dare you trespass my territory!

411
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,087
Thieves?

412
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:57,244
You stole an item from the heavens,
yet you dare to say we’re thieves?

413
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:59,199
- Heavenly officers?
- What?

414
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,359
You don’t know how to use
the celestial eye you’ve stolen?

415
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,119
Don’t you know Winged Dragon - and White Tiger?
- This is bad!

416
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,799
How dare a Rose Gold Bird
like you steal from the heavens?

417
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,239
Return it to us immediately!

418
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,311
Don’t try to struggle like that
half-demon we met earlier.

419
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:15,199
You’ll only make it hard for yourself!

420
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,382
You mean Yu’Er?

421
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:18,639
Where is she?

422
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,367
My lords, my daughter
and I are just lowly demons.

423
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:25,599
You can take back
the celestial eye if you want to!

424
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,007
- But, my daughter...
- That demon is fierce and stubborn.

425
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,599
She will receive her punishment

426
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,439
somewhere else since she had offended us.

427
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,379
My lords, you two just barged in
without notice!

428
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,076
Of course she’ll try to defend herself!

429
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,500
I know you are magnanimous!
Please don’t hold it against her!

430
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,079
- Please let her!
- Enough!

431
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,885
She’ll handle the consequences
for your misdeeds!

432
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,438
I was the one who stole the celestial eye!

433
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,959
You should punish me instead of her!

434
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,414
What has that got to do with my daughter?

435
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,043
Don’t blame her
for something she didn’t do!

436
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:55,204
A lowly demon like you
has no right to question us!

437
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,250
Winged Dragon, save your breath.

438
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,679
Retrieve the celestial eye.

439
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,260
You are so unreasonable!

440
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,460
How dare you touch him!
Are you looking for death?

441
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,446
Here’s another lowly demon.

442
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,199
Purple Fox, be careful.

443
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,344
They’re sacred beasts from the heavens,
Winged Dragon and White Tiger.

444
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,900
So what? Listen up!

445
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,599
Wu Zhi Qi will come soon.

446
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,651
If you dare to touch me,
he’ll beat you up!

447
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,199
Wu Zhi Qi?

448
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,885
That damned monkey?

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,528
Stop wasting our time!

450
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:06,739
You lowly demon!

451
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,158
Wu Zhi Qi!

452
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,056
Winged Dragon, let’s go!

453
00:31:58,057 --> 00:31:59,477
We’re no match for Wu Zhi Qi!

454
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,685
So, they’re over there.

455
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:49,466
How dare she lie to me!

456
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,879
Under King Bailing’s order,

457
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,929
we’re to capture the demons
which are related to God of War.

458
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,533
We shouldn’t mess with that monkey.

459
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:57,959
So that he’ll not cause trouble for us.

460
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,439
I’ll catch that merman then!

461
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,860
You keep an eye on the God of War!

462
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,749
Little Lingzhi, I’ll feed you
some of my qi.

463
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,210
Please grow quickly.

464
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,413
I heard that Flying Snake
became her spirit beast.

465
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,300
You don’t need to mention
that useless fellow.

466
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,911
Are you trying to tip him off?

467
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,415
But as brothers, I need
to remind you something.

468
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:43,084
With his bad temper, I
don’t think he’ll listen to you.

469
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,961
You feed the Lingzhi so much qi every day.

470
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:50,490
Aren’t you afraid that it’ll turn
into a spirit instead of maturing?

471
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,359
That can’t be!

472
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,180
I think the Snow Lingzhi will mature soon.

473
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,780
It will mature within two or three days.

474
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,849
That means we can attend
my father’s birthday.

475
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,014
By then, we’ll return to
Shaoyang Sect together

476
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,325
to celebrate his birthday.

477
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,890
And I’ll ask him for your hand.

478
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,100
Who said I’m willing to marry you?

479
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,453
I don’t think
it’s good for your reputation

480
00:34:20,454 --> 00:34:22,134
if I tell everyone
that you stayed with me.

481
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,540
But, you wanted me to marry you.

482
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,184
That doesn’t count. Bye!

483
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,759
Where did you two go?

484
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,519
I’m starving to death!

485
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,939
Flying Snake, why did you come back?

486
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,069
I’m surprised that you still remember me.

487
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,748
I missed you, you know?

488
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:53,039
It’s meaningless for me to stay here

489
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,879
and see you two act all lovey-dovey.

490
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,780
That’s why I took a nap in the heavens.

491
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,639
Seems like you two had reconciled.

492
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,155
That’s pretty good.
My personal chef is back.

493
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,776
Go and make me some nice food.

494
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,915
Don’t treat Si Feng as your cook.

495
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,891
It’s fine. It’s easy to feed him.

496
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,359
It’s fine.

497
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,780
Little Snake, tell me
what you want to eat.

498
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,479
Did you find out about their reaction
towards God of War?

499
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,822
I have bad news. The heavens
has issued an order to arrest her.

500
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:43,104
The Four Sacred Beasts have
descended to the mortal realm.

501
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,680
The heavens
wants to deal with Xuan Ji

502
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,849
because of her identity.

503
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,164
I thought something was weird too.

504
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,247
But I saw that God of War
and Star of Mosha were

505
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:54,508
the same person
on the paintings in Demon Citadel.

506
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,894
I’m sure there’s something behind that.

507
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:00,079
Don’t you know what’s going on?

508
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,911
The scroll I saw in the heavens
wasn’t complete.

509
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:04,865
I didn’t see the most crucial part.

510
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,526
I really wanted to know...

511
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,705
I really wanted to know
what happened as well.

512
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,999
I wanted to know how
Star of Mosha become God of War.

513
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,820
I think King Bailing is the only one
who knows the whole truth.

514
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,426
You’re a heavenly officer,

515
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,967
yet you don’t care whether
Xuan Ji is a demon or not.

516
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,080
She was Chu Xuan Ji when I first knew her.

517
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,861
And that’s the person I know.

518
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,229
Right.

519
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,874
She’s Chu Xuan Ji.

520
00:36:40,747 --> 00:36:43,207
She has nothing to do
with their past feuds.

521
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,980
Why won’t the heavens let her off?

522
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,252
I just hope that

523
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:53,262
Xuan Ji will never know about these facts.

524
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,079
Don’t worry. The Perfect Fruit
will help to hide your presence.

525
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,387
And I’ve set up a protective barrier.

526
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:02,768
It won’t be easy for the
Four Sacred Beasts to find this place.

527
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,890
Si Feng, look!

528
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,071
The Snow Lingzhi will mature soon.

529
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,820
Gods are fair indeed.

530
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,837
Now,

531
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
we just need to wait
for one more ring to appear.

532
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,300
Si Feng!

533
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,141
- Si Feng! I’ve finally found you!
- Yan Ran?

534
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,283
Ruo Yu?

535
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,309
How dare you still appear

536
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,119
when you’ve committed
so many atrocious deeds?

537
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,026
Xuan Ji, I know I’m sinful.

538
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:02,567
I’m too ashamed to see you two.

539
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,388
But I’m here to help Yan Ran
with her last wish.

540
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:11,422
When she’s done with it, I will
commit suicide to atone for my sins.

541
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,039
Ruo Yu was forced to do them!

542
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,373
Si Feng, Vice Palace Lord
captured his sister.

543
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:17,119
He had no choice too.

544
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,759
Even so, that doesn’t
justify his misdeeds.

545
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,306
Sixth Senior was hurt
because he trusted him.

546
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:25,198
Si Feng treated him as his best friend,

547
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,860
yet he almost killed Si Feng
with his sword!

548
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:32,788
Chu Xuan Ji, no one
can compare to you

549
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,599
when it comes to hurting Si Feng.

550
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,706
You...

551
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,260
Ruo Yu, you had no
choice in the past.

552
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,440
It’s fine if you change for the better.

553
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:45,874
I’ll just treat it as if we’re strangers.

554
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,980
Xuan Ji and I are leading a happy life.

555
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,919
And that’s enough.

556
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,959
How could you lead a happy life with her?

557
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,900
Si Feng, I’m the only one
who truly cares for you.

558
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,100
Silver Snake, do you
still not understand?

559
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,589
Our ties were severed

560
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,719
a long time ago.

561
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,048
I know.

562
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:10,946
That’s why I wanted
to terminate our blood contract.

563
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:12,724
I’ve found a way to do so!

564
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,016
It’s true!

565
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,010
Si Feng, look!

566
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,240
If you let them absorb some of your blood,

567
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:22,641
they will follow my blood
and terminate our blood contract.

568
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:25,679
By then, you won’t be my master anymore.

569
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,031
No.

570
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,471
Why not?

571
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:31,285
Si Feng is seriously injured.

572
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,959
His body won’t be able to take it
if you terminate the contract by force.

573
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,101
Chu Xuan Ji, what are you up to?

574
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:37,708
I won’t stop you
from terminating the contract.

575
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,974
But not today.

576
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,942
Maybe after some days.

577
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,756
After the Snow Lingzhi matures,

578
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,654
you can terminate your contract
whenever Si Feng feels like it.

579
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,991
You’re just afraid that I’ll take over
your place after I terminate the contract.

580
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,559
Yan Ran, don’t force me!

581
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,822
I’ll do it.

582
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,319
You were my spirit beast.

583
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,479
I will give you everything

584
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,719
you want.

585
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,239
Si Feng!

586
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,742
I knew it!

587
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,889
But I’m doing this

588
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,758
just to return you your freedom.

589
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,748
There’s nothing else to this.

590
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,873
You never know what will happen
in the future.

591
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,995
Let’s terminate the contract now.

592
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,345
Silver Snake,

593
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:23,853
you’ll face a thunderous calamity
if you terminate the contract.

594
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,105
You should be careful.

595
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,137
I’m not afraid.

596
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,280
So what if there’s a thunderous calamity?

597
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,584
This flower?

598
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,245
Isn’t it familiar?

599
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,989
That’s the flower you left behind
when you left the realm.

600
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,279
Green Dragon?

601
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,140
This is impossible!

602
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,576
We ate the Perfect Fruit.
You shouldn’t be able to detect us.

603
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:06,988
What trick did you use?

604
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,137
You were a heavenly officer
for so many years.

605
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:14,080
Did you forget the one item
that could help us locate everything?

606
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,599
You...

607
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,129
You took back
Liu Yi Huan’s celestial eye by force?

608
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,962
The celestial eye belonged to the heavens
in the first place.

609
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,717
It was stolen by Liu Yi Huan.

610
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:31,475
Now, we’re just taking it back.

611
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:33,056
This shouldn’t be a surprise.

612
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,789
Who killed Liu Yi Huan?

613
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,279
So what if I did kill him?

614
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,719
Not only that,

615
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,279
I will chop off Chu Xuan Ji’s arm
to terminate her blood contract with you.

616
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,559
Try it if you dare!

617
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,743
I’m a dragon! You’re a snake!

618
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:56,724
Do you think you can win against me?

619
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:01,479
Although I’m weaker than
you, I’ll make you regret it

620
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,116
if you dare to touch Chu Xuan Ji!

621
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,279
Are you out of your mind?
Liu Yi Huan isn’t dead!

622
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,199
We just took back the celestial eye!

623
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,620
I wanted to terminate her blood contract
with you because...

624
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,865
King Bailing had issued a kill order.

625
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:47,813
Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,
Black Tortoise and I

626
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:49,477
are here to deal with her.

627
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,592
I’m here to tip you off.

628
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:58,973
I don’t want you to die with her.

629
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,956
It’s rare for you to care about me.

630
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,246
But Green Dragon,

631
00:43:06,945 --> 00:43:08,785
seems like you don’t
understand me well enough.

632
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,271
I, Flying Snake, have never been
afraid of death!

633
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:17,020
Even if there’s a kill order,
even if the Four Sacred Beasts are here,

634
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,997
you need to get through me
before you touch Chu Xuan Ji!

635
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,778
Do you want to die so badly?

636
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,128
Green Dragon, the
heavens is a cold place.

637
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:34,179
You should come to the mortal realm
when you have the chance.

638
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,380
There are many things more
important than one’s life here.

639
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,839
You’re acting like this because
you involved yourself in mortal affairs!

640
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,860
Seems like you won’t wake up
if I don’t beat you up!

641
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,526
Fine.

642
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:46,319
I’ve been avoiding you for so many years.

643
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,759
It’s time for us to have a fight!

644
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,488
- Si Feng!
- Silver Snake!

645
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:31,999
Si Feng!

646
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,839
- Si Feng, how do you feel?
- Si Feng.

647
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,023
Si Feng!

648
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,980
I’m fine.

649
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,430
The blood contract is gone!

650
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,183
The blood contract is gone!

651
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,557
- Silver Snake!
- Silver Snake!

652
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,697
- This is bad!
- Why are you stopping? Are you scared?

653
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:30,039
Leave now!

654
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,719
Fine! You better leave, you coward!

655
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,287
Didn’t you see that?

656
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,519
This is a thunderous calamity.

657
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,079
I don’t know who attracted
the thunderous calamity,

658
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,312
but this area is under
the watch of the heavens now.

659
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:48,953
It’ll be too late if you don’t leave now.

660
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:53,102
Xuan Ji is in danger.

661
00:45:53,899 --> 00:45:55,519
Flying Snake, come back!

662
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,727
Green Dragon, here’s an order!

663
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,038
By the orders of King Bailing,

664
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,703
the Four Sacred Beasts are to meet up
and hunt down the God of War!

665
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:04,084
Yes, my king!

666
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:22,137
Ruo Yu!

667
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,340
The third strike,

668
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,460
it’s actually the Golden Lightning?

669
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,544
Si Feng, no!

670
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,039
Si Feng!

671
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,940
Si Feng!

672
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,460
Si Feng!

673
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,532
Si Feng, why is your body so hot?

674
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,399
Si Feng, is it because you can’t
control the divine weapons’ power anymore?

675
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,020
Si Feng, hang in there!

676
00:47:15,827 --> 00:47:17,439
Why is this happening?

677
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,239
It’s hard for me to find you, you know?
Please be safe!

678
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,420
Hang in there! Please be safe!

679
00:47:23,618 --> 00:47:25,071
You must be safe!
