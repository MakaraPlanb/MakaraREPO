<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,354 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>EPISODE 58</i>

3
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,239
Are you trying to
revolt against me, General?

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Stop lying to me!

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,407
Tell me.

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,679
What are these?

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,675
Every single piece of my body,
who put them together for me?

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,650
Do you

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,522
feel a tiny bit guilty
about what you did to me?

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,679
God of War!

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,239
Shouldn’t you call me Rahu Ketu?

12
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,199
You conspired with Southern Lord

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,759
and used the Jade Cup of
Southern immortals to seal my soul!

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,850
Now, I want you
to explain yourself.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,239
Let me ask you!

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,697
Where is my soul?

17
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,199
Isn’t it good to be God of War?

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,497
Fine.

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,817
All these years,

20
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,279
I’ve lived in confusion.

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,559
I didn’t know where
I was born or came from.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,799
I had no name because
you dared not mention it.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,053
I had no family and friends

24
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,959
because you’re afraid that
I’d find out my origin.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,319
And I never had one single soldier
under my command.

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,599
You relied on my ability,
and yet you’re scared of me.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,170
You’re afraid that I’d recall everything,
lead the army, and rebel against you!

28
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:56,175
In fact, the reason I’m so
different is because I’m not myself.

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,079
No wonder I felt upset
whenever I killed an Asura.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,599
Because we came from the same clan.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,599
And you, King Bailing,
ordered me to kill them all!

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,749
Tell me, why did you do that?

33
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,560
Are you sure you can control me forever?

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,719
You deceived me into
becoming the God of War.

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,959
I have always trusted you.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,364
How dare you and the heavens
use me like this!

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,119
God of War!

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,719
You’re being disobedient and rebellious.
This is unpardonable!

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,399
What did I do wrong?

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
It’s your fault.

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,399
Ask Jade Emperor to come and see me!

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,959
If not, I will burn
the heavens down!

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,399
Even though you’re a brave general,

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,679
you shouldn’t have
barged into the celestial hall

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,159
and bawled at King Bailing!

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,378
This heavens,

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,399
I could protect it.

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,839
And I can kill it.

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,965
How outrageous you are!

50
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,016
Take her down!

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,999
Bailing!

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,720
I want you to explain yourself today!

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,494
Bailing.

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,521
Just you wait.

55
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,999
I will definitely take it back.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,060
God of War!

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,119
- Enough!
- Stop calling me God of War!

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,719
I will not let you go!

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,344
I will kill you.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,766
I will kill all you rats
and avenge myself!

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,919
God of War is attempting a rebellion
and revolting against the realm!

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,210
Escort her to
the Altar of Banishment at once!

63
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,061
Yu Si Feng.

64
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,639
Do you see this?

65
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,359
This is the heavens
that you wanted to protect.

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,759
They remain despicable.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,319
And they don’t keep their word.

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,911
They keep spouting lies.

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,119
Heaven and earth are the furnace.
His copper, all things of creation.

70
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,679
In that case, let’s throw everyone
into the furnace for reformation.

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,930
Today, I am going to kill everyone
in the heavens.

72
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,199
I shall reorder the three realms.

73
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,170
Do you all think you can guard
this Sea of Life and Death?

74
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,559
Yu Si Feng.

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,911
Just stay in this barrier.

76
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,645
- No.
- And watch how I kill them.

77
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,105
No.

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,930
The Sea of Life and Death has receded.

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,159
Listen my fellow tribes!

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,358
Let us storm the heavens!

81
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,799
Look.

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,374
That’s Jade Emperor’s mansion.

83
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,039
Bailing.

84
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,310
I’m here.

85
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,239
You can’t go any further!
You can’t destroy Transcendent Furnace!

86
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,919
And I won’t allow you to talk
the stinky woman into doing evil!

87
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,719
You must obey me because
you are Chu Xuan Ji’s spirit beast.

88
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,809
Otherwise, you will be punished.

89
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,032
The stinky woman
is my one and only master.

90
00:08:59,033 --> 00:08:59,999
You are not.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,177
Let her out now!

92
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,813
You used to be
the spirit beast of Chu Xuan Ji.

93
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,439
I’m not going to kill you.

94
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,679
But it doesn’t mean that
you have the right to talk to me.

95
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,804
Scram!

96
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,679
Brother Rahu.

97
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,819
You’re here.

98
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,043
I remember we once promised
that we’d drink and talk every day.

99
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,639
I’m surprised that
thousand years have passed.

100
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,599
Since we’re gathering here
today, why don’t we catch up

101
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,047
so as to fulfill our promise?

102
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,503
Do you think I’ll still believe
what you say, Bailing?

103
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,295
Brother Rahu.

104
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:26,786
Can’t you even catch up with me?

105
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,882
A cup of wine crippled me
thousand years ago.

106
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:35,999
If you were me, would
you drink such tea again?

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,397
You worry too much.

108
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,439
Brother Ketu.

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,155
You’re always on my mind.

110
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:44,599
That’s why I came to advise you.

111
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,479
For the sake of our friendship from
the heavens to mortal realm,

112
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,957
stop it.

113
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,709
Bailing.

114
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,913
You lie too much.
That’s why you’re deceiving yourself.

115
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,879
Have you ever looked down at your hands?

116
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,199
They’re full of Chu Xuan Ji’s blood.

117
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,279
The blood of God of War. And mine.

118
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,839
It’s not dry yet.

119
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,800
All you want is
a marionette you can control.

120
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,687
Today,

121
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,998
I am going to take revenge
against this blood feud!

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,159
I’ve been trying to save you
for thousand years,

123
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,999
but I can’t get rid of
your murderous thoughts.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,532
It seems that Asuras
are incurably murderous.

125
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,519
Forget it.

126
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,058
Look, what is this?

127
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,639
Mirror of 36 Heavenly Spirits?

128
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,319
That’s right.

129
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,399
This Mirror of 36 Heavenly
Spirits restrain all kinds of demons

130
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,439
and get rid of all kinds of evil thoughts.

131
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,399
Today, I am going to capture you with it.

132
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,824
And I hope you will abandon
your murderous thoughts and repent!

133
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,479
Bailing.

134
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,959
In the Sea of Life and Death, I saw
thousands souls of Asuras who were killed.

135
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,719
They’ve been tortured by hatred
for thousands of years.

136
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,159
And they’ve looked forward
to avenge themselves.

137
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,319
You want us to abandon
the murderous thoughts and repent?

138
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,959
Today, I will let them ask you this.

139
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,080
When will you reap what you sow?

140
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:50,713
Next, it’s your turn.

141
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,239
Rahu Ketu.

142
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,839
So what if you manage
to destroy the mirror?

143
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,708
This is Heavenly Central Hall,
where the strongest heaven’s law lies.

144
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,719
You can’t even figure out where I am.

145
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,559
Don’t you act outrageous here!

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,719
I know you’re being protected
by the heaven’s law.

147
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,559
And you think I can’t hurt you.

148
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,239
But what a pity. Heaven’s law
was made when the world was created.

149
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,879
As long as I overturn Transcendent Furnace
and rewrite the rules,

150
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,039
you won’t be able to hide yourself.

151
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,799
What a boaster you are!

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,719
Transcendent Furnace
is the root of the three realms.

153
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,159
There is no way you can find it!

154
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,203
Is it?

155
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,368
You seem to have forgotten that I
was once God of War of the heavens.

156
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:45,478
I happen to know
how to make it show itself.

157
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,528
Stop it!

158
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,130
Stop it now!

159
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,901
Xuan Ji.

160
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,079
Who are you who’ve
trespassed Mount Kunlun?

161
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,799
It’s outrageous of you to come
to Xi Wangmu’s backyard.

162
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,599
If you disturb Jade Emperor’s rest,

163
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,799
heavenly punishment
will be meted out to you.

164
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
Heavenly officer,

165
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,322
we came all the way here
to report something to Jade Emperor.

166
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,639
You’re mouthy.

167
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,372
Kick them off to the mortal realm.

168
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,319
- Yes!
- Off to the mortal realm?

169
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,206
We walked a long way!

170
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:15,759
- It took a lot of effort to come up here!
- What are you waiting for?

171
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,078
Take all of them down!

172
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,999
Old fogey, aren’t you being unreasonable?

173
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,879
Bring it on then!

174
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,119
We’re here to beg Jade Emperor.
We can’t act recklessly.

175
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,719
But do we let them send us
back to the mortal realm?

176
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,014
Since he said that we can’t
disturb Jade Emperor, we will then...

177
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,119
- Jade Emperor!
- Old Jade Emperor, come out!

178
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,599
- Jade Emperor, we’re here to see you!
- Jade Emperor!

179
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,359
- Come out!
- Jade Emperor!

180
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,159
- We would like to see Jade Emperor!
- Come out and see us!

181
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,079
- Come out now!
- Save us!

182
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,439
Take all of them down!

183
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,006
- We want to see Jade Emperor!
- Come out, Old Jade Emperor!

184
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,519
Lord Xuan Huo, let them see me.

185
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,768
Jade Emperor, but they...

186
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,599
Jade Emperor.

187
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,721
They are here.

188
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,104
We have here two mortals,
two Rose Gold Birds,

189
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,239
and a demon monkey.

190
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,860
What are you here for?

191
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,479
Jade Emperor, we’re all
family and friends of Chu Xuan Ji.

192
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,658
We came all the way to
Mount Kunlun to ask for your help.

193
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,801
Chu Xuan Ji?

194
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,719
That lass who’s
the reincarnation of God of War.

195
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,719
I remember that her power
of God of War has awaken.

196
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,359
The mortal realm is now invincible.

197
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,841
What else can I do for her?

198
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,279
Jade Cup is opened.

199
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,919
Xuan Ji has become
Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

200
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,000
He’s going to lead the demons
and attack the heavens.

201
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,719
And he wants to reshape the three realms.

202
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,839
You must save the three realms, please.

203
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,759
And save Xuan Ji!

204
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,959
It is true that one reaps what one sows.

205
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,705
The time has finally come.

206
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,399
Jade Emperor.

207
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,155
Why are you still playing chess?

208
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,370
Because I have yet
to figure out this game.

209
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:46,959
Jade Emperor.

210
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,759
The three realms are going to be ruined.
Aren’t you worried?

211
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,567
I once advised Bailing against
it, but he insisted on doing so.

212
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:58,319
Thus, what is happening.

213
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,399
Everyone from the three realms
are all in this calamity.

214
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,239
It’s kind of you to
worry about the people.

215
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,519
But the heaven’s law
made me the Jade Emperor.

216
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,959
I must obey the law.

217
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,290
Without a chance, I can’t interfere with
the fate of three realms.

218
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,639
You should leave.

219
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,799
What is a chance?

220
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,719
We came all the way here to see you.
Now that’s a chance.

221
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,719
Both the mortal realms and sects
are fighting against the Heaven Fire

222
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,861
and rescuing the people.
That too is a chance.

223
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:28,519
Yu Si Feng came to the mortal realm
because of Xuan Ji.

224
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,879
That’s more of a chance.

225
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,060
I think, surely you know his
name in the heavens, Xi Xuan.

226
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,679
He is trying his best
to save the three realms.

227
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,439
We are doing the same thing.
So is everyone else.

228
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,919
And you’re not doing anything about it.
Chance? That’s just an excuse!

229
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,439
Xi Xuan.

230
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,609
He is as persistent as he was.

231
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,079
Lass, you’re right.

232
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,759
But this is their chance, not mine.

233
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,865
Chance is not predictable,
and yet heart is.

234
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,439
I am holding a black stone
and solving this endgame.

235
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,879
It is the chance I have.

236
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,110
If I manage to win this game,
that means my chance is here.

237
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:16,389
But you see,

238
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,239
now the white stones are
more than black stones.

239
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,199
This shows that
my chance are still far away.

240
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
Fine. Since you’re helping us
only if the black stones win,

241
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,450
I’ll help you solve this game then.

242
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,003
Now that the chessboard is
full of black stones, you won.

243
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:42,999
How could you?

244
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,999
How outrageous you are!

245
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,055
How dare you spoil Xi Wangmu’s endgame!

246
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,660
Hurry and take down this disobedient lass!

247
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,839
Interesting.

248
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,608
It is truly interesting.

249
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,879
It was an unsolvable endgame.

250
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,370
And the ink has dyed
the white stones black.

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,738
It is against the rules
to call this a victory.

252
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,239
But it cannot be called a defeat

253
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,599
since the board is full of black stones.

254
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,195
Perhaps I didn’t realize that because
I was so involved in the game.

255
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,559
And you jumped out of the game.

256
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,177
And that’s the solution.

257
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,559
Fine.

258
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,330
I’ll come with you.

259
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,320
Thank you, Jade Emperor!

260
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:39,839
Jade Emperor!

261
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,199
What about me?

262
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,160
How do I go back?

263
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,610
My lord, what do we do?

264
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,611
What else could we do?

265
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,725
The solution is to jump out of the game.

266
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,223
Let’s walk back.

267
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,839
How dare you!

268
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,039
You didn’t see this coming, did you?

269
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,976
The God of War who used to
protect the heavens...

270
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,810
is now turning it upside down!

271
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:14,599
What an irony!

272
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,559
You tried to make God of War
serve the heavens, by fair means or foul.

273
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,839
Fine!

274
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,399
Today, I will use this face of God of War

275
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,384
to destroy the heavens
you’ve meant to protect

276
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,039
and avenge my humiliation with my blood!

277
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,799
Rahu Ketu!

278
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,039
You’re ruining the world and the people!

279
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,627
You are unforgivable!

280
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,519
Unforgivable?

281
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,439
I’ve become unforgivable

282
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,210
when I killed the Asuras
thousands of years ago!

283
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,239
The wails you are hearing,

284
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,885
the Asuras I killed
let out the same wails!

285
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,119
They say every living thing suffers.

286
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,599
But why do they have to suffer?

287
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,437
It’s because of the heaven’s law and fate!

288
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,935
Heaven’s law

289
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,119
is made by the Transcendent Furnace.

290
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,319
I just need to overturn the furnace,

291
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,959
and all this suffering
will cease to exist!

292
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,519
Dream on!

293
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,959
I am standing right here,
and you shall not go near the furnace!

294
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,545
You are overestimating yourself!

295
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:22,369
I will not let you
destroy the three realms!

296
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,079
You want to die?

297
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,559
No rush.

298
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,289
You are next!

299
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,635
No!

300
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,958
Xuan Ji.

301
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,215
Yu Si Feng.

302
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,804
Stop digging your own grave.

303
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,062
Rahu Ketu.

304
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,399
If the Transcendent Furnace
gets destroyed,

305
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,291
everything will cease to exist.

306
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,416
What you love and hate will all be gone.

307
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:15,877
You can’t do that.

308
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:21,022
I am Star of Mosha,
not Chu Xuan Ji.

309
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:23,443
I don’t want love and hate.

310
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,217
Just let it go.

311
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,399
Yu Si Feng.

312
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,290
Don’t think I won’t kill you.

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
If you really want to kill me,

314
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:43,539
go ahead then.

315
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:46,599
I’m going to die anyway
after the furnace gets destroyed.

316
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,010
Instead of dying for no reason,

317
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:51,823
I’d rather be killed by you.

318
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:54,384
Didn’t you leave half of
your primordial spirit in Demon Citadel?

319
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,730
I want a complete self.

320
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,883
If the furnace gets ruined,
my memory will be gone.

321
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,582
Even if this body survives,
it’s no different than death.

322
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,879
I’d rather be killed by you.

323
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,890
That’s better than living like
a living dead that has no memory.

324
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,793
I have no interest in killing you myself.

325
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:18,119
Since you didn’t preserve
any primordial spirit,

326
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,210
you shall fend for yourself.

327
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,439
Jade Emperor.

328
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,039
Bailing.

329
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,381
I told you so.

330
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,387
Xi Xuan.

331
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,484
Jade Emperor.

332
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,039
You’re still in the mortal realm.

333
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,658
I should call you by
the name you use there.

334
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,063
Yu Si Feng.

335
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,999
I know everything you did.

336
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,370
Well done.

337
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,199
Long time no see, Rahu Ketu.

338
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,639
I was wondering who could
stop my divine weapons.

339
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,559
It turns out that Jade Emperor is here.

340
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,821
This has to do with the three realms.

341
00:27:57,822 --> 00:28:02,810
Not only should I be here,
everyone should come here.

342
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,525
Greetings, Jade Emperor.

343
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,999
Xuan Ji, we’ve told Jade Emperor
about your grievance.

344
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,310
He’ll take care of it. You need not
ruin Transcendent Furnace anymore.

345
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,279
Jade Emperor.

346
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,018
Are you all here to stop me?

347
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,031
I’m not trying to stop you.

348
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,919
But the resentment
between you and Bailing

349
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,592
has to do with
all the lives in three realms.

350
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:38,079
As the lord of heavens,
I have to solve this problem.

351
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,479
Jade Emperor.

352
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,719
This demon is unstoppable.

353
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,119
I tried my best, but I couldn’t stop him.

354
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,199
Please take him down, Jade Emperor!

355
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,159
I told you so.
Everything has karma.

356
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,399
You made the God of War
and killed all the Asuras.

357
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,599
You ordered both the heavens
and mortal realm to kill the demons.

358
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,888
You initiated Heavenly Meteor Formation
and offered up Shaoyang.

359
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,719
You killed the mortals
with Sea of Life and Death.

360
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,719
They’re all extremely tragic incidents.

361
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,043
Those lost lives, they all
belonged to the three realms.

362
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,559
And now you’re accusing
Rahu Ketu of being demonish.

363
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,605
I think you are the one
who’s being demonish!

364
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:36,599
Jade Emperor.

365
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,484
I did all this to protect
the three realms!

366
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:44,125
Not at all, it’s to protect your madness!

367
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,639
Is this what you want?

368
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,839
In fact, that day you’ve
made the wrong decision

369
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,903
at Baiyu Pavilion by
the bank of Ruoshui River.

370
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,198
No.

371
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,319
That’s not the case.

372
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,479
Do you refuse to believe it?

373
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,525
Fine. Let me show you
what it would look like

374
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:18,607
if you did not poison Rahu
Ketu’s wine thousands of years ago.

375
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,159
You need not worry.

376
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,978
In fact, I came with a good news.

377
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,979
Immortals and demons
are having a fierce war.

378
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,624
There’s no good news.

379
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,340
It has to do with this great war.

380
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:38,947
Two days ago, I submitted
a memorial to His Majesty

381
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:41,079
requesting for a ceasefire in
the heavens and Demon Citadel.

382
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,879
His Majesty said yes to it.

383
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,199
Really?

384
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,799
Positive.

385
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,319
After this drink with you,
I’ll go communicate the decree.

386
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,400
The entire army of Asura will withdraw
and head back to Demon Citadel.

387
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,639
The three realms
will be peaceful from then on.

388
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,386
Why don’t you finish
this cup of wine?

389
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,164
- Sure.
- Here.

390
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,690
- Please.
- Please.

391
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,199
Bailing.

392
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,359
You ruined the peace we could have had.

393
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,279
The war broke out again because
the Asuras didn’t receive the decree.

394
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,759
If you could stop back then, things
wouldn’t have turned out this way.

395
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,719
But you insisted on judging others
by your own standards,

396
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,439
and went down to human realm
to control God of War’s trial.

397
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,279
In fact, if you hadn’t
gone down the realm,

398
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,412
this trial would’ve been over by now.

399
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,879
I, Chu Xuan Ji,
have completed all ten trials.

400
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,439
And I have regained my flesh and blood.

401
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,839
I know what love is.

402
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,679
I seek for your permission to come back
to the heavens, Jade Emperor.

403
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,799
Yu Si Feng and I will work together

404
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,898
to protect everyone in the three realms.

405
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,584
Is it my fault?

406
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,302
Is it really my fault?

407
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:29,945
Bailing.

408
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,719
Everything in this world
has its own conscience.

409
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,999
If you don’t move, he won’t.

410
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,919
But you buried your evil inside
the heart and manipulated others.

411
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,519
Without you knowing,

412
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,119
this evil of yours has long
grown into a very tall tree.

413
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,756
A gigantic and merciless tree.

414
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,793
It’s me.

415
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,197
I’ve hurt the three realms.

416
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,987
It’s me.

417
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,439
It’s all because of me.

418
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,639
You always thought that
it’s God of War who’s being evil.

419
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,959
You thought it’s Rahu Ketu.

420
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,719
In fact, you’re the evil one.

421
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,399
Everything in this world
is originally empty.

422
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,419
Out of nothing, yin and yang spin.

423
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,719
They reinforce and counteract each other.

424
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,199
The heavens is originally empty.
So is Asura.

425
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,759
Since they’re both empty, how can
the heavens be superior?

426
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,359
How can the mortal and
demon realms be inferior?

427
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,359
You cared too much about
the heavens’ safety.

428
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,962
That’s why you became irreversibly evil.

429
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,201
Please give me some hints, Jade Emperor.

430
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:52,911
How can I make up for it?

431
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:54,730
Please give me some hint, Jade Emperor!

432
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,279
Too late.

433
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,197
It is already too late.

434
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:10,981
Jade Emperor.

435
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,347
I caused this calamity.

436
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:17,639
I know that I’m deeply sinful.

437
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:23,359
Today, I will strip myself of my
immortal qualities and powers

438
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,231
to compensate the world for what I did.

439
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,759
King Bailing, you are
the head of heavens.

440
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,319
Without the heavenly qualities,
you will devolve into a trivial deity.

441
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,883
Please think twice!

442
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,471
- Please think twice, King Bailing.
- Please don’t do that, King Bailing.

443
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,455
Please think twice, King Bailing.

444
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,241
For thousands of years,

445
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,919
I’ve worried too much.

446
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,039
That’s why I became like this.

447
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,292
Stop talking.

448
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:55,250
From today onward, you all
should learn from my mistakes

449
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,470
and behave yourselves.

450
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,374
Bailing.

451
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,192
Is this really what you want?

452
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,519
Jade Emperor.

453
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,213
I have made up my mind.

454
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,399
Fine.

455
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,686
Perhaps

456
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,039
this is your chance.

457
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,730
- King Bailing!
- King Bailing!

458
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,679
King Bailing.

459
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,810
King Bailing!

460
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,327
King Bailing!

461
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,119
Rahu Ketu.

462
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,959
Bailing has stripped himself
of his heavenly qualities.

463
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,119
He is now a powerless trivial deity.

464
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,505
Could you have mercy on him?

465
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,550
Jade Emperor.

466
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,559
You shouldn’t have bothered yourself.

467
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,919
Are you trying to make me
change my mind with this show?

468
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,439
Fine.

469
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,119
Then let me ask you.

470
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,319
Will the Asuras come back to life with him
being stripped of heavenly qualities?

471
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,528
With him being stripped of heavenly power,

472
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:10,479
will I be able to forget
that painful suffering?

473
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,845
You’ve underestimated my pain.

474
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:18,719
Fine. Even if the three realms
are slaughtered as you wish,

475
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,879
then what?

476
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,279
Everything will be empty after that.

477
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,119
You were a human in the first nine lives
and couldn’t stop being resentful.

478
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,879
But you finally got over it in this life.

479
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,279
And you’ve found
the most important person in your life.

480
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,279
Isn’t this far better than
being a murderous tool?

481
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,879
You once asked me this.

482
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,965
Where else can you go
since you’re not a deity or Asura?

483
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,639
Isn’t the mortal realm
where your heart is?

484
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,199
Or, do you really want to destroy
everything in the mortal realm

485
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,919
and indulge in the anger?

486
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,679
So what if I indulge in the anger?

487
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,039
That’s the path I chose.
I need to figure it out.

488
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,688
Be it Rahu Ketu or Chu Xuan Ji,

489
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:03,190
in your eyes, they are just
insignificant existence.

490
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:05,799
Even though my life is insignificant,

491
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,567
I will never let you all mess with it.

492
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:11,359
As long as the heaven’s law
remains unchanged,

493
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,839
there will be another evil Bailing
even though this one has been banished.

494
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,799
Thus, only by destroying
the Transcendent Furnace

495
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,090
can I get rid of your arrogance.

496
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,039
Jade Emperor.

497
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,476
Fight with me or go away.

498
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,359
It’s the heavens’ fault.
I have no right to stop you.

499
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,239
If you insist on destroying the ruin,
I can’t do nothing about it.

500
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,639
Yet, when the furnace collapses
and the karma vanishes,

501
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,079
all of your friends and family
will return to the chaos void.

502
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,079
Is that really what you want?

503
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,024
Xuan Ji. Don’t, Xuan Ji!

504
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,850
Rahu Ketu.

505
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,048
Turn around and look at
your family and friends.

506
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,168
They could’ve stayed at
Shaoyang for their safety.

507
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,013
But they couldn’t bear to forget

508
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,919
the experiences we share.

509
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,959
That’s why they came here
despite the difficulties.

510
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,642
Although they know they’d be
killed, they want you to know that

511
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,042
they care a lot about you.

512
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,879
Whether you’re Rahu
Ketu or Xuan Ji, in this life,

513
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,599
those around you love you deeply.

514
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,090
They protect you.

515
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,569
You’re no longer
that lonely Star of Mosha.

516
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,172
You’re a family member, friend,

517
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,283
a loved one whom we can’t let go.

518
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,839
Demon Lord, listen to it.

519
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,319
These people are trying to talk you
into turning into Chu Xuan Ji.

520
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,839
In fact, they don’t care about you at all.

521
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,319
They care only about Chu Xuan Ji.

522
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,519
After all, these are all
Chu Xuan Ji’s family, friends,

523
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,079
and loved one.

524
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,734
They’re not yours.

525
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,119
Our great army

526
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,439
has scattered the primordial spirit
around Demon Citadel.

527
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,864
When the furnace is collapsed
and the three realms are ruined,

528
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:13,875
the world will belong to us demons.

529
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,729
Don’t let their words ruin our grand plan.

530
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,239
Since Bailing didn’t care about life,

531
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,159
why should I care about
love, friends, and family?

532
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,054
They are impermanent.

533
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,599
Jade Emperor, I am definitely
destroying the furnace.

534
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,598
If that’s the case, go ahead then.

535
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,652
Xuan Ji.

536
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,199
All of your friends and family
will return to the chaos void.

537
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,891
Is that really what you want?

538
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,204
Xuan Ji.

539
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,189
No.

540
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,210
No!

541
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:29,975
What is this?

542
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,679
I have just hit the String of
Yellow Millet and let you foresee

543
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,719
what happens when
the three realms are destroyed.

544
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,479
Illusion.

545
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,479
It is all an illusion!

546
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,759
It is not an illusion.

547
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,999
If you insist on smashing the furnace,
what you saw will become the reality.

548
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,719
I cannot stop you from taking revenge.

549
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,439
But it concerns the life on three realms.

550
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,239
I just hope that you won’t
regret your decision.

551
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,879
Rahu Ketu.

552
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,359
You said you were a heartless man.

553
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,442
But you just shed tears.

554
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,819
How can a heartless man

555
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,370
shed tears?

556
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,359
It’s obvious that you’re
gaining fresh and blood.

557
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,479
Try to accept yourself.

558
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,799
Don’t let your hatred blind you.

559
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,359
Shut up!

560
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,799
I will not believe everything you say!

561
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,119
Demon Lord, if you are wavering
because of their sweet nothings,

562
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,999
listen to what I am about to say
and you will no longer hesitate.

563
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,911
Yu Si Feng has long betrayed you.

564
00:44:33,912 --> 00:44:37,799
He said he came to the heavens
and discussed it with King Bailing.

565
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,519
In fact, they have long decided to
help the heavens change your mind.

566
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,689
If you listen to him and
don’t ruin the three realms,

567
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,719
that shows he can control you.

568
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,799
This Yu Si Feng.

569
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,272
It is obvious that

570
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,919
he wants to be the new Jade Cup
which King Bailing can use

571
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,563
to seal your soul!

572
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:00,879
Demon Lord.

573
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,199
You’ve broken my defensive spell.

574
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,839
You want to kill me.

575
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,079
Yuan Lang.

576
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,839
I’d have bought into your lie
if you’d framed somebody else.

577
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,959
But I remember every single thing
Yu Si Feng did in his ten lives.

578
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,999
You said he betrayed me.

579
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,132
Do you think I’ll believe you?

580
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:18,256
Demon Lord.

581
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:20,198
I am wrong.

582
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,792
I am wrong!

583
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,919
You betrayed the Demon Citadel,
framed Wu Zhi Qi,

584
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,079
and seized the power of God of War.

585
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,279
They are all your schemes.

586
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,010
If Bailing is called vicious,

587
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,119
you can be called a backstabber.

588
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,719
There is no way I’m keeping
a backstabber by my side.

589
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,616
Take your own life.

590
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:39,865
Demon Lord.

591
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:43,799
I have been working for you
for thousands of years.

592
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,007
Now that we are going to succeed,
you want me to kill myself?

593
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,431
You were working for yourself, not me.

594
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,999
Don’t think I don’t know
what you’re up to.

595
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,664
If I really destroy the three realms,
my next enemy would be you.

596
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,399
I never thought that
the effort I put into the grand plan

597
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,111
would eventually lead to my death.

598
00:46:10,112 --> 00:46:12,199
That’s really careless of me.

599
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,599
Demon Lord, it seems that
you’ve bought into their nonsense!

600
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,999
And you are not going
to destroy the furnace.

601
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,599
If so, you shall be burnt into
ashes in the Great Gold Flame!

602
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:28,148
I, Yuan Lang, want to be
the head of three realms!
