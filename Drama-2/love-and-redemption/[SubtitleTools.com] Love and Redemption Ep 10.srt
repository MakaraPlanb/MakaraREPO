00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,351
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,624
<i>EPISODE 10</i>

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,358
It’s exactly as Si Feng said.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,239
Does everyone
in Lize Palace know this spell?

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,280
It’s embarrassing to say this.
I don’t know these spells.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,919
Si Feng is gifted.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,758
The usual disciples of Lize Palace
can’t even compete with him.

8
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,839
If it wasn’t for
the palace lord forcing him,

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,758
I don’t even know what would happen.

10
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,597
His natural gift might be wasted.

11
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:48,479
What’s wrong with Si Feng?
Why did your palace lord force him?

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,719
It’s nothing much.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,199
He just wants him to go back to
the right path. But Si Feng...

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,719
Outsiders cannot ask about
what happened at Lize Palace.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,039
Ruo Yu, you talked too much. Let’s go.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,319
What does Lize Palace
got to do with you then?

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,719
You don’t see yourself as an outsider?

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,319
What do you know?

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,679
- I know everything.
- Enough.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,751
- What don’t I know?
- What do you know?

21
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:06,787
- What do you know then?
- Enough.

22
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:08,192
- What’s wrong with me?
- Stop arguing.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,820
The exit is near.

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,061
Let’s go.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,991
- Move! Me first!
- Don’t be rash!

26
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,320
Get up!

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Ling Long!

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,399
Si Feng! Don’t go!

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,110
Don’t worry. I’ve recovered.

30
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,397
You should be worried
about Zhong Min Yan.

31
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:56,240
I do, but I...

32
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:59,279
Shaoyang’s Transmission Charm?

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,800
This is bad!
Ling Long and the rest are in trouble!

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,925
- Bird demon!
- Let us go!

35
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,359
I’ll kill you if I get out!

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,431
Ugly little demon! Let us go!

37
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,640
Stop arguing at this time!

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,640
Ling Long!

39
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,519
If Xuan Ji and Si Feng
are baited by the charm,

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,999
how much of
Si Feng’s power will be recovered?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,359
Within an hour of using the secret arts,

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,759
even if force was used,
only 30% of the power will be recovered.

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,959
It’s bad.

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,040
Do you think we will be annihilated?

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,799
Careful! Don’t come here!

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
Let them go!

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,879
- Ling Long!
- Beware of traps.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,439
You are the one who hurt me?

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,239
Yes. You fool!

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,480
How dare you embarrass yourself here?

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
Look out!

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,240
- Save them. I will kill him.
- Alright.

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,120
Xuan Ji, look out!

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,640
- Xuan Ji!
- Si Feng!

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,480
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,720
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
Si Feng!

58
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
Si Feng.

59
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,799
What are you?

60
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Who are you

61
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,999
to ask me?

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,999
The two stars will merge soon.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,040
No one can stop
Sky Hall from doing what they want!

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
Si Feng!

65
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,880
Xuan Ji.

66
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,023
Xuan Ji.

67
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
Xuan Ji!

68
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,183
Xuan Ji.

69
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,040
Xuan Ji.

70
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:19,959
Si Feng!

71
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,159
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji.

72
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,079
- Si Feng.
- Xuan Ji, how are you?

73
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
Xuan Ji.

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,719
- Si Feng.
- I’m fine.

75
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,919
What’s wrong with Xuan Ji?

76
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,239
Xuan Ji’s Yang Jue Skill is
between level seven and eight.

77
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,296
Her mental state is unstable.
Something went wrong.

78
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:37,359
She passed out due to exhaustion.

79
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,319
It’ll be fine when she wakes up.

80
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,519
Really?

81
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,199
Why didn’t I know?

82
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,119
How did you know?

83
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,159
What do you mean something went wrong?
She almost killed Si Feng!

84
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,518
Xuan Ji didn’t do it on purpose.

85
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,879
- What do you mean?
- She wanted to save him

86
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,359
and went mad.

87
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,559
I’m fine.

88
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,399
She didn’t do it on purpose.

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,854
No more arguments

90
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,279
now that the demon is killed.

91
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,479
Ruo Yu.

92
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
Let’s take a look over there.

93
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,599
Si Feng.

94
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,080
Why did you release all the Quru Birds?

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,598
They were controlled by the Aoyin.

96
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,079
Now that the Aoyin is dead,

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,119
the Quru Birds are harmless.

98
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,278
That Aoyin cleaned the furnace beforehand.

99
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,559
There’s no residue at all.

100
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,079
I wonder what did these Zhuyu Grass
were used for.

101
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,799
This demon said it was from Sky Hall,
and said some unknown things.

102
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,461
I wonder what Sky Hall is planning?

103
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:37,429
Unexpectedly, Sky Hall seems like
they disappeared for the past four years

104
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,279
but they have been
doing something secretly.

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,160
We don’t understand what does
two stars merging for now as well.

106
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,462
Why don’t we send

107
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,222
letters back to our sects

108
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,320
to warn them?

109
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Look out!

110
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,155
- What is that?
- No worries.

111
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,879
That is Aoyin’s tendon.
It’s a stubborn thing.

112
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,142
It will be stuck onto flesh and blood.

113
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:10,759
It’s a great material
to make Demon Tying Rope.

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,360
Si Feng, let’s go back
since the demon is dead.

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Let’s first regroup at Wangxian Town.

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,575
If you have no place to stay,

117
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,719
we can stay together.

118
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
Alright.

119
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,599
Master, are you still going
to visit Chu Xuan Ji?

120
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,519
You’ll be worried
as long as she isn’t awake, right?

121
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,703
You should know the Loveless Mask
prevents you from falling in love.

122
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,359
You shouldn’t stay here.

123
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,199
I know more about you

124
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,920
regarding my life.

125
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,198
Nothing worries me here.

126
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,399
Find the shopkeeper to pay for the room.

127
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
We are leaving.

128
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Master is trying to pay for the room.

129
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,560
Master, wait for me.

130
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,279
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji.

131
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,599
You’re awake?

132
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
How are you?

133
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,679
Where’s the Aoyin?

134
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,359
We were saved?

135
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,396
How were we saved?

136
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,719
Also, Si Feng.

137
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,518
- Is Si Feng alright?
- Xuan Ji.

138
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,879
Don’t worry.

139
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,214
You killed the Aoyin. Don’t you remember?

140
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,480
Me?

141
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,967
Xuan Ji went mad at that time.

142
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:44,999
She had no conscience.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,559
Xuan Ji, when you practise next time,
try to be safe, and don’t rush.

144
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,960
I...

145
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,559
Don’t think too much.

146
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,199
Oh, the people of Wangxian Town

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,439
want to thank us
with a banquet downstairs.

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,639
I’m sure there are
many delicious food for you.

149
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,919
Pack up.

150
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,599
Let’s...

151
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,879
Sixth Senior.

152
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,960
I still have something else to ask you.

153
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,319
Ling Long,

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,926
I have something
to talk about with Xuan Ji.

155
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:22,319
Why don’t you head down,
and greet them first?

156
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
I’ll head there with Xuan Ji soon.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,160
Alright.

158
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,359
What is Xuan Ji hiding from me?

159
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,118
Even if there’s a secret,

160
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,270
it should be a secret with me.

161
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,471
When did Little Six and her...

162
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,414
Si Feng, you must be here to see Xuan Ji.

163
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:03,719
Don’t worry, Xuan Ji is awake.

164
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,994
But, she has something
to talk about with Little Six.

165
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,559
It’s inconvenient for you to go there.

166
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,519
Chu Xuan Ji’s condition
is none of our business.

167
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,119
No one cares. Don’t think too much.

168
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,604
No one cares?

169
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,519
Si Feng cares.

170
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,719
I know you don’t care.
No one cares whether you care or not.

171
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,640
- Si Feng doesn’t care...
- Immortal master!

172
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,598
The immortal masters are here.

173
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:25,548
We have nothing
to repay for the immortal masters’

174
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,778
help for Wangxian Town.

175
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,523
We can only prepare
a simple banquet to thank all of you.

176
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,519
All of you must not reject our invitation.

177
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,679
- Please head there.
- Please.

178
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,679
Go on ahead.
I’ll invite other immortal masters.

179
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,189
It’s alright. My sister and another senior
have something to talk about.

180
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,359
- They will go later.
- Sure.

181
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,160
Please head over there.

182
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,280
Isn’t that the same as
what happened with Gudiao?

183
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,719
Why did it happen again?

184
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,399
Also, I’m always feeling that
I did something to Si Feng.

185
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,759
Sixth Senior.

186
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Can you tell me
what happened at that time?

187
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,302
You were pointing your fingertips
at Si Feng.

188
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:06,119
You almost...

189
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,279
But you stopped immediately.
Si Feng is fine.

190
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,200
- You didn’t hurt him.
- I...

191
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,830
I dreamt of it.

192
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,798
Inside my dreams,

193
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,894
I was always killing people.

194
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,599
I was covered in blood.

195
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,534
But why can’t I feel anything?

196
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:26,840
I...

197
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,919
I...

198
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,959
I almost killed Si Feng.

199
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,359
That’s not it, Xuan Ji.

200
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,919
That was just a dream.

201
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,079
But it almost came true.

202
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,632
I wanted to protect everyone.

203
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,199
But I couldn’t control myself.

204
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,519
I am afraid that I will become a monster

205
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,279
who recognises no one
and kills for no reason.

206
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,559
That won’t happen, Xuan Ji.

207
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,300
Calm down.
Don’t confuse your dream with reality.

208
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,119
But those dreams...

209
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,470
When the dreams overlapped
with the shards,

210
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,920
they...

211
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,323
Everyone. A toast to the immortal masters.

212
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,672
If it weren’t for
their help to kill the demon,

213
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,410
Wangxian Town will
have to suffer from a famine.

214
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:15,320
- Thank you, immortal masters.
- Thank you, immortal masters.

215
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:23,134
The people of Wangxian Town want
to thank us with a banquet downstairs.

216
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:24,319
Sixth Senior.

217
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
I still have something else to ask you.

218
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,518
Ling Long, I have something
to talk about with Xuan Ji.

219
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,886
Why don’t you head down...

220
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,240
Si Feng.

221
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:41,959
Si Feng, let’s leave after the meal.

222
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,318
Why are you in a rush again?
We just sat down.

223
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,166
Si Feng knows what he is doing.

224
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,918
He won’t be rushing to his death.

225
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,110
Don’t say that word again. How dare you?

226
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,359
Enough.

227
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,598
Just eat.

228
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,959
Si Feng.

229
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,080
Si Feng.

230
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:08,239
Si Feng, why won’t you drink with me?

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,559
Why are you so cold towards me?

232
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,999
You forgot about our relationship?

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,759
You forgot that we killed the Gudiao
and save the merman together?

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,255
You forgot that we went to Dianjinggu
to punish Wu Tong?

235
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:19,559
Stop talking.

236
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,151
- Shut up!
- You...

237
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:23,200
Enough. Let’s eat.

238
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,039
Zhuyu Grass?

239
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,159
It was used as fuel.

240
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,607
I see.

241
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,046
Sixth Senior.

242
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:52,734
I am too afraid.

243
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,399
The merman told me

244
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,325
I am not my complete self.

245
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:59,277
What if

246
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,358
I can’t control myself one day

247
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,079
and make all those dreams come true?

248
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,222
Merman?

249
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,639
You mean the shards
of the Mirror of Origin?

250
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,960
Why are you mentioning this again?
Didn’t you say you will forget about it?

251
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,118
Senior Hao Chen

252
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,478
did forbid me
to find the Mirror of Origin.

253
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,479
But

254
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,399
I didn’t give him the shard I have.

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,039
- I’m always feeling...
- Xuan Ji.

256
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
Do you still have the shard with you?

257
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,039
That must be the problem.

258
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,999
Don’t be deceived by the merman.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,026
Demons like to deceive people,
and create a demon in them.

260
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,582
I’m sure you have a demon in you.

261
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,000
A demon in me?

262
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,522
Why did the demon used me?

263
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:43,719
How would I know
about a demon’s evil deeds?

264
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,399
It’s just like
the Aoyin controlling the Quru Birds

265
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,909
to destroy all the Zhuyu Grass here.

266
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,959
We don’t know the reason for that too.

267
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,159
Xuan Ji, don’t be afraid.

268
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,697
It’s nothing.

269
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,239
Let’s destroy the shard

270
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,840
and it won’t affect you again.

271
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,493
That darn Chu Xuan Ji.

272
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,054
Why did I meet her?

273
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,119
I can’t allow Si Feng
to get mixed up with her again.

274
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,400
I might as well do the extreme.

275
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,332
Sixth Senior.
Why don’t we forget about it?

276
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,359
Let’s hand it to Master.

277
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,519
- No!
- Even though...

278
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,359
I don’t know
what kind of troubles you will get into.

279
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,999
We can’t tell others.

280
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,319
Let’s try again.
Think of a way to destroy it

281
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
and let it become an eternal secret.

282
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,120
Look out!

283
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,759
- Sixth Senior. I can’t move.
- I feel numb too.

284
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,597
I think the spell got reflected.

285
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,991
What about the shard?

286
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:00,710
The shard has been destroyed.
It’s all over.

287
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:02,839
But, we are in this situation.

288
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,720
- Why don’t we call for help?
- No.

289
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,461
How can we explain this?

290
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:08,917
We can’t call them.

291
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:10,839
How should I explain this?

292
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,286
Use your qi.

293
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,687
Use your qi to break the spell.

294
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,240
Si Feng.

295
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,852
You forgot how well you treated Xuan Ji?

296
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:28,955
Xuan Ji got hurt because she took
the hairpin from Wu Tong for you.

297
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,239
You cared about her.

298
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,782
I always thought you liked Xuan Ji.

299
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,960
What’s wrong with you?

300
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,639
That’s nonsense.

301
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,479
Lize Palace has its rules.

302
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,439
Disciples should not
be friends with others.

303
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,679
It’s my duty.

304
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,919
Duty?

305
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,120
Fine.

306
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,158
Let go of your duty today.

307
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,759
Did you really forget us?

308
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,319
You don’t care about us and Xuan Ji?

309
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,999
Anything exceeding my duty

310
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,719
will bring its consequences.

311
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,360
You don’t have to think too much.

312
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,919
Fine.

313
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,999
Fine, you forgot everything.

314
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,479
It’s fine if you changed.

315
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,919
But the one who grew up with me...

316
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,959
The one who grew up with me

317
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,719
changed in an instant too.

318
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,917
I didn’t know anything about her

319
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:17,718
like a total stranger.

320
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:25,799
Si Feng, I think
I saw a shadow over there.

321
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,880
Do you think it’s a demon?

322
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,759
Where’s the demon?

323
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,479
Where’s the demon you saw?

324
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,999
I think I saw a shadow went in

325
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,679
but I’m not sure if it’s a demon.

326
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,239
Xuan Ji.

327
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,520
Xuan Ji!

328
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,319
Ling Long.

329
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,920
Ling Long, you’re finally here.

330
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,639
It’s not what it seems.

331
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,999
We are just...

332
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
- We are...
- Zhong Min Yan.

333
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:09,919
How dare you!
How dare you bully my sister?

334
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,359
- I won’t forgive you!
- Ling Long.

335
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,599
- He bullied you!
- No. Stop it.

336
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,462
Sixth Senior did not bully me.

337
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,439
Ling Long. Since we disturbed them,

338
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,599
- let’s just leave.
- Don’t touch me!

339
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,959
Let me tell you.

340
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,385
Don’t try to add fuel to the fire.

341
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:30,679
What did I do?

342
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,598
Can you explain what you are doing?

343
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,439
We were just...

344
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,320
- Zhong Min Yan, I’ll kill you!
- Ling Long!

345
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,639
Xuan Ji, he was bullying you
because he thought you are ignorant.

346
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,922
- Don’t you know that?
- No. Sixth Senior didn’t bully me.

347
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,759
He was just helping me. It’s true.

348
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,679
I was helping Xuan Ji with her troubles.

349
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,399
I tripped accidentally.

350
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,719
You want to kill me? Fine.

351
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
I’ll stand here. Kill me.

352
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,366
- You...
- Xuan Ji, move!

353
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,640
I’ll kill him!

354
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,302
You want to kill me?

355
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,533
Fine.

356
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,479
Let’s see how you kill me.

357
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,079
You don’t care anymore
once your temper comes up.

358
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,079
I’ve had enough. Kill me!

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,032
Don’t regret it.

360
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,479
You might hug me and cry

361
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,400
when you regain your consciousness.

362
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,613
Why should I regret?
I hate you in all of Shaoyang Sect.

363
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:28,868
If you die, I’ll laugh in my dreams.

364
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,239
Ling Long.

365
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,960
Stop it.

366
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,639
Use it to defend yourself.

367
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,918
Isn’t this your family heirloom?

368
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,639
Yes. It’s for my future wife.

369
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,200
This dagger

370
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,720
is with you.

371
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,959
This dagger was given to me
by Sixth Senior

372
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,119
before I went up to Xuyang Peak.

373
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,400
Yes.

374
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,000
I gave it to Xuan Ji.

375
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,600
He gave it to you four years ago?

376
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,358
Yes.

377
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,479
Young lady of Shaoyang Sect.
Isn’t that obvious?

378
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,279
Both of them were engaged with each other.

379
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,800
Being intimate for awhile
isn’t something surprising.

380
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,719
Xuan Ji.

381
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,360
He gave you his family heirloom dagger.

382
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,040
You are really going to be
a daughter-in-law of Zhong family.

383
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,360
Keep it well.

384
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,879
Zhong Min Yan.

385
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,323
In that case,

386
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:04,334
stop behaving casually

387
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:05,854
and treat Xuan Ji well.

388
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,342
I won’t forgive you

389
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:08,960
if you don’t.

390
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:11,080
Ling Long.

391
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
Si Feng, let’s leave.

392
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,288
Farewell.

393
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Si Feng!

394
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,724
Silver Snake. Are you satisfied?

395
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,519
I admit that I lured you there

396
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,159
but she isn’t worth your time and efforts.
Isn’t that right?

397
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,039
You don’t have to do anything.

398
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,520
Si Feng!

399
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:51,879
Si Feng!

400
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,240
Si Feng!

401
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,960
Si Feng, don’t leave.
I have something to tell you.

402
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
I’m sorry. I’m busy.

403
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,981
Si Feng. We didn’t meet for four years.

404
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:13,990
I don’t want to leave you like this.

405
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:15,982
We are just strangers.

406
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,399
Stop pestering me.

407
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,680
Don’t get involved with me.

408
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,239
Si Feng!

409
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,560
Don’t touch it!

410
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
What is this?

411
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:49,532
<i>WINE</i>

412
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,680
Are you crying?

413
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,039
Leave me alone.

414
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,959
I have something to tell you.

415
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,279
I could give you an explanation
if you weren’t throwing a tantrum.

416
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,480
Yes. I’m stupid and foolish.
I didn’t see it clearly.

417
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,751
Do you have to act this way?

418
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:11,639
Can’t we talk at all?

419
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,280
- Can you let me finish...
- Zhong Min Yan!

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,159
In your eyes,

421
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,879
aren’t I a stubborn young lady
who always causes troubles?

422
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,773
You look down on me in your heart.

423
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:23,840
Why are you still compromising for me?

424
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,439
I don’t pay attention
to anyone unrelated anyway.

425
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,199
We will both go on our separate ways

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,679
in the future.

427
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,079
- Alright?
- Can’t I say a few words?

428
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,734
You are always like that
since you were young.

429
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,639
You don’t care whenever you got angry.

430
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,039
You don’t show mercy when you were right.
It’s worse if you were wrong.

431
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,599
Do you know what I’m going to say?
It’s fine.

432
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,720
If I have to say,
that Lu Yan Ran is more reasonable.

433
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,799
- At least...
- Great.

434
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,440
You are comparing me with Lu Yan Ran.
I wasted all my time on you.

435
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,559
You are just watching? Help!

436
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,645
It’s useless. Aoyin’s tendon will
grasp firmly on blood and flesh.

437
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,398
It depends on flesh and blood.

438
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,879
We can’t do anything

439
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,800
unless it releases its grasp willingly.

440
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I’ll give you blood if you like them.

441
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,566
Release her and bind me.

442
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,960
Bind me.

443
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,119
It’s not moving.

444
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,358
Yan Ran.

445
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,439
I think the Aoyin tendon
likes Xuan Ji’s blood more.

446
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,119
It’s useless.

447
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,879
I don’t believe it.

448
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,320
Can’t it feel pain? Can’t I cut it?

449
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,728
It’s still not working.

450
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,439
Are you happy?

451
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
If I can’t cut it,
I can cut your hand instead.

452
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
You’ve caused enough trouble.

453
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,782
She’s the one who caused you trouble!

454
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:00,039
Chu Xuan Ji.

455
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,159
You caused such a big trouble.

456
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,079
Why are you smiling?

457
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,708
You’ve noticed it?

458
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,676
I made a mess today.

459
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,919
It’s my bad for smiling.

460
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,199
But you won’t have to leave, right?

461
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,108
- Of course I’m happy.
- I have to leave anyway.

462
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,759
There’s no difference.
Don’t talk about these useless things.

463
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,000
That’s different.

464
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,343
She was trying to cut my hand off,
but you protected me.

465
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:23,959
That means you are worried
and still care about me.

466
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,601
- I’m happy.
- You think too much.

467
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:29,919
I stopped her because it won’t work.

468
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,360
Do you think I want to drag
your dismembered arm along?

469
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,900
Si Feng, let’s not waste our time.

470
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:38,694
Isn’t Xuanyuan Sect nearby?

471
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:41,526
Sect Leader Zhu Shi
is knowledgeable and sophisticated.

472
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:43,101
I’m sure he can
deal with this Aoyin tendon.

473
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,439
That’s our only way.

474
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,959
Everyone is tired today. Rest early.

475
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,000
We will go to Xuanyuan Sect tomorrow.

476
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,839
What about her?

477
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,959
I’m telling you.
Don’t sleep in a room with Si Feng!

478
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,280
You hear me?

479
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,639
Then...

480
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,680
Where should I sleep tonight?

481
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,480
Si Feng.

482
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,134
I am very sleepy.

483
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,840
I can’t sit on the chair any longer.

484
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,239
Sleep.

485
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,719
Si Feng, where will you sleep?

486
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,399
You don’t have to worry.

487
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,320
I will explain to Zhong Min Yan tomorrow.

488
00:29:51,822 --> 00:29:54,262
You have no choice,

489
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,120
but to stay here for the night.

490
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,816
Si Feng, I wanted to ask you.

491
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:01,618
Why is Ling Long so angry

492
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,634
about what happened
to me and Sixth Senior?

493
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,559
She even said Sixth Senior is so bad.

494
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,399
I think Sixth Senior is not bad.

495
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,654
You don’t know what is love.

496
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:13,239
- Don’t think about it.
- Who told you that?

497
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,910
I have someone I like too.

498
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,560
I like Sixth Senior.

499
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,600
Aren’t you sleepy?

500
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,639
Why aren’t you sleeping?

501
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,758
I’m not sleepy now.

502
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,799
I don’t understand.

503
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,799
Although I like Sixth Senior,

504
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,766
Ling Long is just as important
as Sixth Senior.

505
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:35,799
I don’t wish
that either of them is unhappy.

506
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,839
They had a big argument this time

507
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,853
because I like Sixth Senior.

508
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:45,166
Do you think Ling Long
hates and looks down on Sixth Senior?

509
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:48,342
That was why she was angry
when she heard I like Sixth Senior.

510
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:52,279
Si Feng, since you are so smart,
can you help me?

511
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,720
Is there any way to let Ling Long
like Sixth Senior to?

512
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:05,679
I have no time to listen to
the issue between you and Zhong Min Yan.

513
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,726
If you are not sleepy,

514
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,385
just get out.

515
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,720
I’m sleepy.

516
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,278
I haven’t wrote to Senior Hao Chen
about my experience yet.

517
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,285
Si Feng ignores me too.

518
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:38,559
I should write to Senior Hao Chen.

519
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,799
Senior Hao Chen.

520
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,670
I didn’t write to you about my experience

521
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:44,391
because we met a demon recently.

522
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,919
The problem has been solved.

523
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,959
I will report to you about
what happened for the past two days.

524
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,159
First.

525
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,528
I met Si Feng, but he ignores me.

526
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:57,520
He is always trying to leave too.

527
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,839
I’m quite happy now that
he can’t leave at the moment.

528
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,040
I hope I can get back this
important friend of mine this time.

529
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:10,038
Second.

530
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,279
Ling Long and Sixth Senior
had a bad argument.

531
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,192
Ling Long said

532
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,302
her bazi doesn’t match with Sixth Senior’s

533
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,974
so they made up as quickly

534
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:21,039
as they start a new argument.

535
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,391
They always told me not to worry.

536
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,038
It would be better if they can get along

537
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,025
and care for each other.

538
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,350
- Xuan Ji, what are you doing?
- The fire...

539
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:49,806
Si Feng, the fire will shorten the tendon.

540
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:51,280
No!

541
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,806
Si Feng. I told you, right?

542
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,926
This thing will become shorter.

543
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,240
Hand.

544
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:04,014
Si Feng, how is your injury?

545
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,960
Let me take a look at your injury.

546
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,239
Chu Xuan Ji.

547
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,719
Why are you still so reckless?

548
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,079
This is improper.
Aren’t you engaged with Zhong Min Yan?

549
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,639
How could you do that?

550
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,719
I just want to take a look at your injury.

551
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
I don’t need your concern.

552
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,142
This bell...

553
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:57,320
Didn’t you say you threw it?

554
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,910
What does that have to do with you?

555
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,062
It’s a useless thing anyway.

556
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:04,479
I don’t know why it’s still with me.

557
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,840
You never realised
such a big thing on you?

558
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,079
- Don’t you feel anything at all?
- Chu Xuan Ji.

559
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,680
Why do you have so many questions?
How would I know?

560
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,160
You are hungry.

561
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,142
I’ll get you something delicious.

562
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:31,520
Alright.

563
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,240
Delicious.

564
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,439
Si Feng, come closer.

565
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,880
Help me out. I can’t eat it otherwise.

566
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,480
It’s faster this way.
Go to sleep after you eat.

567
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,440
- Si Feng, aren’t you eating?
- Open your mouth.

568
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,774
This is delicious. Try it.

569
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:07,099
It’s fine.

570
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,934
- Try it.
- Shut up.

571
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:10,310
Eat.

572
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,431
Si Feng.

573
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,400
I can’t eat if I shut up.

574
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,800
Are you still eating?

575
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:19,880
I want the soup.

576
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,540
I want that.

577
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
That.

578
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,039
Are you full?

579
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,440
Yes.

580
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,734
Si Feng, look at this.

581
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:20,750
It turned back to normal.

582
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:21,919
Look.

583
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
Stop fooling around. Go to sleep.

584
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,374
Senior Hao Chen.
Nothing special happened.

585
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,759
Grilled fish was delicious.

586
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,982
We ate spicy hotpot.

587
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,800
I’m very happy.

588
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,545
<i>It was fun.</i>

589
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,799
<i>I hope Father will
let us leave the sect more.</i>

590
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,879
Three.

591
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,805
We helped the people of Wangxian
Town deal with the problem of Quru Birds.

592
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,079
The people thanked us.

593
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,638
I’m quite happy.

594
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,479
Zhuyu Grass is so delicious.

595
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,286
It was wasted unfortunately.

596
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:06,439
Oh.

597
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,239
These Quru Birds
were controlled by an Aoyin demon

598
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,725
from sky hall.

599
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:13,613
The Aoyin demon said something
about two stars merging together.

600
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,680
We don’t know what it meant.

601
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,166
Si Feng.

602
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,127
Your shadow looks nice.

603
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:46,414
I forgot. You don’t like people
to praise you.

604
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:49,839
When I told you your smile looked nice,

605
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,828
you got angry all of a sudden.

606
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:55,280
I think you really look nice
when you smile.

607
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,254
But I never see your smile

608
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:01,440
ever since we met again.

609
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,838
I am very worried about you.
I don’t know what happened to you.

610
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,439
I regret it.

611
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,960
I think I missed out a lot of things.

612
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:18,678
Si Feng, I think it’s weird.

613
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,046
I still miss you

614
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:24,280
although you are right in front of me.

615
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Si Feng.

616
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,280
Si Feng.

617
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,080
Si Feng.

618
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,849
Are you asleep?

619
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,920
Si Feng.

620
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,159
Your mask

621
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,447
is different from the one in the past.

622
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,520
Don’t touch.

623
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:36,399
It’s just that

624
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,000
you won’t show me your face ever again?

625
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,959
Can’t we go back to how it used to be?

626
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,479
Finding the Mirror of Origin will fall
into the depths of desire and obsession.

627
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,574
Trapped by the demon within.
It’s bad for cultivating.

628
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:06,879
Sixth Senior always
uses this way to make people happy.

629
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,480
It works every time.

630
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
What’s wrong, Si Feng?
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

631
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:19,720
No.

632
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:24,240
I just think it’s funny.

633
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,040
Funny?

634
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,519
The past.

635
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,160
What happened before.

636
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,160
We can never return anymore.

637
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,600
Chu Xuan Ji.

638
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,301
Why do you still come near me?

639
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
The person I don’t want to see the most

640
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,440
while roaming the world is you.

641
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:50,800
We shouldn’t have met.

642
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,199
Why?

643
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,935
Why?

644
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,560
Tell me.

645
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,400
Why did you choose Zhong Min Yan?

646
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,799
I chose Sixth Senior?

647
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,600
What do you mean?

648
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,480
Why do you

649
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:16,080
like him?

650
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,519
Are you asking why I like Sixth Senior?

651
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,021
I think Sixth Senior is very nice.

652
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,957
I want to see him.

653
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:26,639
I feel happy with him.

654
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,680
I want to be with him forever.

655
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:31,830
He...

656
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:33,840
We also have a secret.

657
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,160
Enough.

658
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,600
Stop it.

659
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,720
I understand.

660
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,240
You asked me for yourself.
Why are you getting angry?

661
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,120
Chu Xuan Ji.

662
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,800
Thanks for telling me all of these.

663
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,840
Si Feng.

664
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,960
- Me and you...
- I’m tired.

665
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,000
It’s getting late.

666
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
I need to sleep.
