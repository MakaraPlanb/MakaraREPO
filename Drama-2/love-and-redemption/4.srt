1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,850
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
<i>EPISODE 4</i>

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,986
Si Feng, leave with him!

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,124
Hurry!

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,639
- Ling Long!
- Xuan Ji!

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,040
Let go of my sister!

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,399
Xuan Ji!

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,679
Xuan Ji!

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,799
Xuan Ji!

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,119
Troublesome girl.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Ling Long!

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,605
Ling Long and Xuan Ji are in trouble!

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,467
Let’s go!

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,599
Chu Ling Long, show
me what you’re capable of.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,882
If you’re the reincarnation
of the God of War or Star of Mosha,

16
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:23,919
you’ll be able to escape this.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,761
If you perish under this spell,

18
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:27,842
that means you’re not
the person we’re looking for.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,160
Ling Long!

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,880
Try and escape!

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
Ling Long!

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,040
Try and escape this!

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
Ling Long!

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,399
- Ling Long, are you okay?
- I’m fine.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
I was so scared!

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
It’s Senior Hao Chen.

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,555
Si Feng!

28
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,559
Are you okay?

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,853
We’re fine.

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,134
What about the merman?

31
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,359
The merman...

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,507
The demons took him away.

33
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:16,679
Hero Yu, I know the Lize Palace
has a different way of doing things,

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,599
and other sects didn’t interfere as well,

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,519
but you brought my fellow juniors
to save that demon.

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,822
I don’t think that’s suitable.

37
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,477
We wanted to save him ourselves.

38
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,027
The merman didn’t harm anyone.

39
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,624
He even helped us in the cave.

40
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,134
How could you pity a demon?

41
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:30,535
You mustn’t have thoughts like that.

42
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,479
But...

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,920
Seniors, thank you for saving me.

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,236
I know my fault now.

45
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,484
It’s fine.

46
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,519
Maybe the demons left some tracks.

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,159
Hao Chen, let’s scout the area.

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,364
Yes.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,040
Si Feng, did the demons
really take him away?

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,948
Follow me.

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
What spell is this?

52
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,319
This is Lize Palace’s spell of deceit.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,069
- It can hide any scent or figure.
- Are you okay?

54
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,319
That’s why no one discovered him.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
Hurry, bring him to the riverside.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Are you in pain?

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,320
I have some medicine here.

58
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,760
Why are you laughing?

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

60
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:57,147
Do we know each other?

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,360
We don’t know each other in this lifetime.

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,960
But now, we know each other.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,960
You know how to speak?

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,799
You were captured by the demons.

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,021
What did they want to do?

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,272
The entire demon tribe
is gathering at Sky Hall.

67
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,759
They’re trying to find the spirit keys.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,133
Spirit keys?

69
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,919
What are those?

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,399
Your sect leaders will know.

71
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,360
I don’t know about anything else.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,319
You mustn’t speak.

73
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
You’re severely injured.
You need to recuperate in the sea.

74
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,550
Regarding the news that you’ve told us,

75
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,065
I will send an anonymous letter

76
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,426
in order to remind the Five Great Sects.

77
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,134
Do you feel better now?

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
He’s crying?

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Their tears do become pearls?

80
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,439
If you hold a Merman’s Tear
under your tongue, you’ll cry.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,239
And only a few people
know about this secret.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,479
They won’t find out.

83
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,360
That’s great! Xuan Ji won’t need to
stay in Mingxia Cave again!

84
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,862
You can try.

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,359
Ling Long, look!

86
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
- I’m crying! I know how to cry!
- Xuan Ji!

87
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,320
Xuan Ji, this is great!

88
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,159
You two are so silly.

89
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Stop mocking us.
You’re the silly one here.

90
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
He’s thanking us.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,280
Xuan Ji, that’s beautiful.

92
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,613
This is just like how I felt
after I ate some sweet snacks.

93
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,999
It’s sweet. I feel happy.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,152
Si Feng, thank you.

95
00:07:58,153 --> 00:07:59,466
Thank you for the Merman’s Tear as well.

96
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,119
You don’t need to thank me.

97
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
It’s a gift from the merman.

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,663
You said that everything
happens for a reason.

99
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,519
You accumulated good karma
after you saved him.

100
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,813
And this is your reward.

101
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,296
Chu Xuan Ji, if you want
to recover your six senses

102
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:23,839
and acquire genuine tears,
you should collect the shards.

103
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,160
What shards?

104
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,716
Shards of the Mirror of Origin.

105
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,839
Mirror of Origin is the immortal item
of the immortal, Xi Wangmu.

106
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,346
It can reveal the origin
of everything in the world.

107
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,479
Xi Wangmu shattered the mirror
and scattered them in the human realm.

108
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,720
Collect all the shards, and
you’ll recover your six senses.

109
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,989
I found one in the secret ground.

110
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,030
And I recovered my taste.

111
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,119
Is that the Mirror of Origin?

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,719
Did I recover my taste
because of the Mirror of Origin?

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,919
Only the Mirror of Origin
is capable of such feat.

114
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,399
Not only that,

115
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,359
you’ll know your true identity
after you collect all of them.

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,959
My true identity?

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,622
I’m Chu Xuan Ji. Who else can I be?

118
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,279
You are you, yet you are not.

119
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,799
Maybe it’s for the best
if you don’t know the whole truth.

120
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,280
But this is your fate.

121
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,479
Chu Xuan Ji, I wish you luck.

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Maybe we’ll meet in the future.

123
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,159
I think the merman can
swim back to the sea from here.

124
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,680
Speaking of which,
I haven’t seen the sea before.

125
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Si Feng, Lize Palace is
located beside the sea, right?

126
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,839
How about we meet up
with Si Feng in Lize Palace next time?

127
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,599
Sure!

128
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,280
Women are not allowed in Lize Palace.

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,158
I only know that they
don’t accept any female disciple.

130
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,893
But women are not allowed inside?

131
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,719
Are you guys going to stay single forever?

132
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
We won’t be able to marry anyone
after we enter Lize Palace.

133
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,128
Is that why everyone in Lize
Palace needs to wear a mask?

134
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,899
But Si Feng, your mask was removed.

135
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,879
We’ve seen your real face as well.

136
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,080
Don’t tell me the people
who had seen your face need to marry you?

137
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,639
- I’m done for.
- Marry?

138
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,623
I saw your real face.

139
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:24,239
- That means I need to...
- Little Six, you’re overthinking.

140
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,159
All of us saw his real face, you know?

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,719
Besides, Xuan Ji was the first person
to see his real face.

142
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,608
It has nothing to do with you.
Si Feng, am I right?

143
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,279
Such rule doesn’t exist.

144
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,496
It’s just that...

145
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
I’ll owe someone a favour.

146
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,611
Owe someone a favour?

147
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,639
Are you talking about the merman?

148
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,031
- We saved him of our own accord.
- That’s right.

149
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,800
We support each other
through thick and thin.

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,880
Father told me that favours
don’t matter in friendship,

151
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,961
only loyalty matters.

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,569
Friendship.

153
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,759
In the past, no one told
me about these things.

154
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
It was my first time
hearing these strange thoughts.

155
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,679
Why don’t you join Shaoyang Sect?
That way, we won’t be separated.

156
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Maybe we can drink in secret every day.

157
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,320
Come, check out this amazing wine.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,600
The speciality of Mount Lutai, fruit wine.

159
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,226
Since we’re going to be friends forever,

160
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,191
let’s finish this drink together.

161
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,424
- Great!
- Great!

162
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,574
Sure.

163
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,603
Cheers.

164
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,799
Xuan Ji, don’t worry.

165
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,679
We will help you find the shards
of Mirror of Origin.

166
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,599
If we train hard enough
and travel around the world,

167
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,439
I’m sure we’ll find them.

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,538
By then, not only will you taste the wine,
you’ll enjoy the fragrance as well.

169
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,479
And we’ll be able to see
a Xuan Ji who’s afraid of pain.

170
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,095
That’s right. No matter
what’s your true identity,

171
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:06,264
it’s fine because we know who you are.

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,734
After I find the Mirror of Origin,
I’ll be able to recover my six senses.

173
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,960
And I will become like everybody else.

174
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:15,232
No matter what happens in the future,
I just want to

175
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,667
stay together with everyone and be happy.

176
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,028
That’ll be great.

177
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

178
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Chu Ling Long wasn’t
the person we’re looking for.

179
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,479
I will try to test the others
who have the same birth date

180
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,279
as the reincarnations of
the God of War and the Star of Mosha.

181
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,004
We wouldn’t need to go through
all these troubles

182
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:42,109
if you all didn’t lose track
of their reincarnations

183
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,310
at Fenru City 16 years ago.

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,456
It was our fault.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,399
My lord, don’t worry.

186
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,469
I’ll find out the location
of the spirit keys as soon as possible.

187
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,470
I’ll find out where
the Five Great Sects had hidden them.

188
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,789
We’ll save Left Lieutenant and assist
you in retrieving the Divine Weapon.

189
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,561
We’ll summon the Star of Mosha

190
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,562
and dominate the three realms once again.

191
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:07,039
Si Feng,

192
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,039
if we talk about fate, it seems that
you have an affinity with Xuan Ji.

193
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,920
You two were born on the same day.

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,920
Even I couldn’t compare with that.

195
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:21,748
Since you’re twins, why weren’t
you born at the same time?

196
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,119
We’re twins.

197
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,759
But Xuan Ji was a lazy girl.

198
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,010
She didn’t want to come out.

199
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:32,479
She stayed in our mother’s belly
for another night.

200
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,428
That’s why I was born at 9 at night
on the fourth day of the fourth month,

201
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,680
while she was born at 1 in the morning
on the fifth day of the fourth month.

202
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,548
So that’s the case.

203
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,120
You’re hungry again?

204
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,519
You’re hungry?
I’ll catch some fishes and cook them.

205
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,359
Great idea. I’ll join you.

206
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,206
Little Six, you better catch a big fish.

207
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,457
Okay.

208
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,974
Xuan Ji, I thought you had just eaten?

209
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:57,695
I don’t know what’s going on either.

210
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,530
Isn’t this the book you used when
Mother taught us how to write our names?

211
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,790
You kept it with you?

212
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,462
I knew our Xuan Ji wasn’t emotionless

213
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:10,263
even though you couldn’t shed any tears.

214
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,599
Mother told me to write down the names
of those who are important to me.

215
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,478
Can I see who’s included?

216
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,798
Sure.

217
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,199
Father.

218
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,919
Mother.

219
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,241
Ling Long.

220
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,539
That’s all?

221
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,516
Who else do you want to be included?

222
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:37,917
You can write down the name
of the person you like.

223
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,786
These are all the people I like.

224
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,392
It’s not that.

225
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:44,119
I’m not talking about our family.

226
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,536
If you like someone,
you wish to see him every day.

227
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,799
And you want to be with him at all times.

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,959
You’ll share your secrets with him.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,402
And he’ll directly affect
your mood as well.

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,805
He...

231
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,080
Ling Long, do you
have someone you like?

232
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,000
I...

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
I... I’ll check
how they’re doing!

234
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,760
If I like someone, I’ll
share my secrets with him?

235
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,569
I’m so hungry.

236
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,400
Why isn’t Sixth Senior here yet?

237
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,738
Xuan Ji, this is a secret between us.

238
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:53,341
You mustn’t tell anyone else.

239
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,389
So, the person whom I wish
to meet and share secrets with,

240
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,999
that’s the person I like.

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,520
I do have similarities
with other people as well.

242
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,968
Ling Long said I must write his name down.

243
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,653
<i>SIXTH SENIOR</i>

244
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,879
Xuan Ji.

245
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,890
- Sixth Senior.
- We caught many fishes.

246
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,472
- You’ll be able to eat soon.
- Okay.

247
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,631
Oh right, I picked the same gift
for you and Ling Long.

248
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:35,628
But seems like Ling Long doesn’t like it.

249
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,041
I’ll give them to you then.

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,082
Maybe it’s because I’m too dumb.

251
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,803
I always give her something
she doesn’t like.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,959
Maybe it’s because other people
don’t like me as well.

253
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,720
Not at all. Sixth Senior, I like you.

254
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,719
What?

255
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,419
You’re the person that I like.

256
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
Silly girl, what do you know?

257
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,345
Little Six, come here.

258
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:06,266
- Help us with the fishes.
- Coming.

259
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,413
You can cook it with her.

260
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,796
Hurry up.

261
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
- Si Feng.
- What is this?

262
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,024
Sixth Senior gave me this.

263
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,960
Si Feng, what colour is it?

264
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,144
It’s blue.

265
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,160
This is blue?

266
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,763
My favourite colour is blue then.

267
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,560
Is it fragrant and nice?

268
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,200
It’s not, and it’s hideous.

269
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,609
Really?

270
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,249
I’ll be able to feel that for myself
when I recover my six senses.

271
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,123
By the way, Si Feng,
we’ll return to Mount Shaoyang tomorrow.

272
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:01,489
After we meet Father,
I’ll tell you about how

273
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,410
we can avoid the Candle Dragon
and retrieve your mask.

274
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,281
Xuan Ji, actually,
this is dangerous.

275
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,442
Maybe Sect Leader Chu would find out.

276
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:15,021
You don’t need to force yourself
if it’s too hard.

277
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:18,559
Since I didn’t manage to
obtain Gudiao’s horns for you.

278
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,159
It’s no problem. Friends
shouldn’t be so calculative.

279
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,439
I promised you I’ll do so.

280
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,680
That’s why I’ll do anything
to help you retrieve your mask.

281
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,168
Silly girl.

282
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,320
It was hard for you
to escape Mingxia Cave, you know?

283
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,039
Actually, it’s fine even if
I lose the mask.

284
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,520
You don’t need to find it
and you don’t need to return there.

285
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Is it really fine?

286
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,029
It’s fine.

287
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,247
Xuan Ji,

288
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,657
thank you.

289
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,125
Uncle.

290
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,342
Master.

291
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,319
Father.

292
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,659
We’re back.

293
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,380
Who gave you permission to return here?

294
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,781
You’re getting out of control.

295
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,918
Father, please don’t blame Sister.

296
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,639
It’s my fault.

297
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,254
I only understood many things
after I went down the mountain.

298
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:50,224
It was all my fault. I was disobedient.

299
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:53,062
Now, I know the reason
you scolded me in the past.

300
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,918
You did the right thing.

301
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,799
I won’t act like this again.

302
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,160
Father.

303
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,331
Great.

304
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,159
Good girl.

305
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,881
Seems like you understood my intentions.

306
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,039
My effort was not in vain.

307
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,321
I’m sure your mother would
be relieved to hear this.

308
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,028
So, Xuan Ji doesn’t need to
enter Mingxia Cave again.

309
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,709
I feel relieved.

310
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,919
Xuan Ji, this is great!

311
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,075
Xuan Ji, you should return and rest first.

312
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:32,051
Little Six and I will send some
local specialities to the other members.

313
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,919
We’ll find you after that, okay?

314
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,865
- Okay.
- See you.

315
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,152
Little Six, let’s go.

316
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,464
Merman’s Tear is useful indeed.

317
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:44,850
Senior Hao Chen.

318
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,920
Don’t worry. I’m the only one
who knows about this.

319
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,963
Xuan Ji, let me ask you this.

320
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,404
Do you really want to train yourself?

321
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,239
In the past, I had no reason to do so.

322
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,242
But after the incident at Mount Lutai,

323
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:02,440
I realized that I need to train hard
to protect those I want to protect.

324
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,599
That’s good.

325
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,959
Xuan Ji, actually,
you’re as good as anyone else.

326
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,807
If there’s a chance for you
to learn great spells

327
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:15,039
and become a powerful
cultivator, will you grab the chance?

328
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,955
Senior Hao Chen, are you mocking me?

329
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:21,559
I don’t even have the right
to attend the Flower Session.

330
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,820
There’s no rush.

331
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,159
Think about it for now.

332
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,879
We’ll talk about that
after the Flower Session.

333
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,371
Now, we should celebrate
our return from Mount Lutai.

334
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,253
Si Feng doesn’t want me
to retrieve the mask,

335
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,534
but I’ve made a promise with him.

336
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,800
I must keep my words.

337
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,279
I can’t enter the secret ground by myself.

338
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,640
If I use spells, the barrier
will respond to them.

339
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,793
Si Feng!

340
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,239
Si Feng!

341
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,866
Xuan Ji? Why are you here?

342
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,159
I’m here to help you.

343
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,639
Didn’t I tell you not to help me?

344
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,240
You’ll be punished by your father
if he finds out.

345
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,425
But you’ll be punished
if you don’t retrieve your mask.

346
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:10,661
Follow me.

347
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,891
The Candle Dragon is hiding here.

348
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,799
If we alert it, it’ll activate
the protection rock.

349
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,560
It’s fine. There’s a way
we could sneak past it.

350
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,119
Look. We’ll use this.

351
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,339
This Lightning Truncheon can only
teleport one person at a time.

352
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,949
But there are two of us here.

353
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,670
Just treat the two of us
as one individual then.

354
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,880
Don’t move. I’m going to cast the spell.

355
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Look! I told you it would work.

356
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,646
Si Feng.

357
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,080
Let’s find your mask now.

358
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Si Feng, your mask!

359
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
My mask.

360
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,206
Si Feng!

361
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,001
Si Feng, it’s fine.
We can come again tomorrow.

362
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:47,880
We’ll find the other half of the mask
and glue it back together.

363
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,680
Maybe the item broke

364
00:23:58,197 --> 00:23:59,997
while we fought the Candle Dragon.

365
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,459
The masks in Lize Palace can’t be fixed.

366
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,079
Fate has decided for my mask to be broken.

367
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
We’ll just forget about it.

368
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,040
I need to meet my master now.

369
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,460
Do you still have respect for me?

370
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,279
Master.

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,559
Si Feng, you were distracted
by your feelings.

372
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
You even forgot about the 13 Abstinence!

373
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,935
You should return and receive
your punishment for your mistake.

374
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,880
What a great disciple indeed.

375
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600
Master, I’ve let you down.
Please punish me.

376
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,281
Si Feng!

377
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:38,562
Si Feng, are you okay?

378
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,838
Xuan Ji, this is their internal affair.

379
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,160
You mustn’t interrupt.

380
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:47,189
Si Feng, you only said you let me down.

381
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,959
But you didn’t admit your mistake.

382
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
Do you know your mistake?

383
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,800
I removed his mask. You should
punish me instead of him.

384
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,460
Xuan Ji!

385
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,174
My lord, Xuan Ji is young and ignorant.

386
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,490
Please forgive her for her rudeness.

387
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,436
Did I say anything wrong? He didn’t remove
the mask of his own accord.

388
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,598
Moreover, he almost lost his life
trying to retrieve the mask.

389
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,440
Si Feng’s life and the mask,
which is more important to you?

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,321
Such audacity! This is
the internal affair of Lize Palace!

391
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:19,595
You have no right to say anything!

392
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,733
Xuan Ji, this has nothing to do with you.

393
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:24,543
Hurry and apologise to the palace lord.

394
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,798
Lize Palace’s internal affairs
have nothing to do with me indeed.

395
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,159
But he’s my best friend, and
I will do something about this.

396
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,940
You can’t answer my questions,
yet you’re trying to punish Si Feng.

397
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,581
I’m just trying to seek an answer.

398
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,239
I’m envious of Sect Leader Chu
for having a daughter like her.

399
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,537
Si Feng.

400
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,079
This girl is trying so hard to help you.

401
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,785
I’m very surprised.

402
00:25:49,786 --> 00:25:53,440
What? Have you made new friends
after only a few days?

403
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,790
Yes. In the past, I never
knew what a friend was.

404
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,957
But now, I understand the
profound sentiments of friendship.

405
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,520
What? Profound sentiments of friendship?

406
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,423
My lord, the other sect leaders
are waiting for you for the meeting.

407
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:28,024
Please don’t delay this any longer.

408
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,894
My lord, please.

409
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Profound sentiments of friendship.

410
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,680
Si Feng, get up now.

411
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,959
Does it hurt?

412
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,206
I’m fine.

413
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,230
Why did you try to save me
from my master’s punishment?

414
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,519
You’re reckless indeed.

415
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,319
I’m fine. I’m just afraid that
he’ll punish you for my mistake.

416
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,160
Si Feng, will he punish you?

417
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,559
I’ll be fine.

418
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,810
Don’t worry.

419
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,629
That’s good to hear.

420
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,479
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

421
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,614
Everyone, these are the Demon Collars

422
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:29,265
that we found on Gudiao and Tengu.

423
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:33,199
Besides that, we’ve received
an anonymous letter as well.

424
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,160
It states that the demon tribe
is manipulating

425
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,278
both of the beasts mentioned.

426
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,949
And Sky Hall is the name
of the demon tribe’s organisation.

427
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,560
Has anyone heard of this news?

428
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,039
Sky Hall?

429
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,298
It doesn’t ring a bell.

430
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,639
An anonymous letter
without any proves or evidences.

431
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,000
Sect Leader Chu, you don’t need to
take it seriously.

432
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,439
That’s right.

433
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,234
The demon tribe was defeated
in the war 1,000 years ago.

434
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:03,559
Why should we be afraid?

435
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,599
I’m sure it’s only some minor demons
trying to cause a ruckus.

436
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,471
There’s no need for us to worry.

437
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:12,032
I’m afraid things aren’t that simple.

438
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,643
If the content of the anonymous
letter is true, the demon tribe

439
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:21,084
will try to obtain the five spirit keys
that the Five Great Sects are protecting.

440
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,079
Spirit keys?

441
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,459
What are you talking about?

442
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,038
Has anyone ever heard of that?

443
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,102
That concerns the very existence
of our sects.

444
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:33,184
I don’t think we should
discuss it in public.

445
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:36,759
If the content is fake, I’m afraid it
would cause us to turn against each other.

446
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,359
Valley Master Rong is right.

447
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,640
In my opinion,

448
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:43,040
Sect Leader Chu, you should focus on
handling the Flower Session.

449
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,253
Farewell.

450
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:56,695
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

451
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,600
I didn’t expect the sects
to be divided among themselves

452
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,872
after I went for my training.

453
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,357
I hope the other sects
will be ready for this.

454
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:13,870
And act more cautiously.

455
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I hope I’m the one
overthinking here.

456
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,359
Si Feng!

457
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,801
Si Feng!

458
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,355
- Why are you here?
- Si Feng.

459
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:48,719
Why are you here? Is he
still insisting on punishing you?

460
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,639
But why? I’ll argue with him.

461
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,079
You mustn’t. My master has a bad temper.

462
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,599
He won’t let you off.

463
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,319
There’s nothing to fear. At most,
he’ll just give me a beating.

464
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,719
He’s too brave for his own good.
He broke our rules.

465
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,695
You should consider your position
before you try to imitate him.

466
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:04,359
He’s doing this because
he has a strong backing.

467
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,320
Our lord won’t let others off that easily.

468
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,919
Return now.

469
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,639
I’m kneeling here of my own accord.

470
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,945
My master didn’t punish me.

471
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:29,380
Why?

472
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,101
He’ll only be appeased if I do so.

473
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,640
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

474
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,519
Oh right, Si Feng, I brought
you some dried fruits.

475
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,599
They’re very sweet.
Since you’re doing this,

476
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,840
you should have some sweet stuff
in order to ease your pain. Here.

477
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,707
Is it delicious?

478
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,559
I’ll take this for now.

479
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,079
You should leave.

480
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,467
Remember to eat them.

481
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,170
Look. The Flower Session
hasn’t even started,

482
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,220
yet Chu Lei is trying to show that
he’s the leader of the Five Great Sects.

483
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:34,501
Don’t tell me Shaoyang Sect
will be the champion again?

484
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,507
Ask Shi Feng to prepare himself.

485
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:40,423
We need to be the champion no matter what.

486
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:44,246
The Xuanyuan Sect should be
the leader of the Five Great Sects!

487
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,437
Yes.

488
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,237
Follow me.

489
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,905
Master.

490
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,195
Master?

491
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,719
Isn’t friendship the only thing you need?

492
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,533
You don’t need me anymore.

493
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:20,799
I don’t dare to do so.

494
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,440
I’ve broken the rules.
I’m willing to accept my punishment.

495
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:27,129
Those who can’t keep
their true nature in check

496
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:29,586
will be judged by the elder council.

497
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:32,449
And receive the 13 Punishments
in Lianyu Pagoda.

498
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,786
I’m afraid you can’t
endure all of the punishments.

499
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,719
As your head disciple,
I should be a role model for others.

500
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,952
- I won’t escape.
- You!

501
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,640
Look at you now.

502
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,472
You are the most outstanding disciple

503
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,912
I had in Lize Palace
for the past few hundred years.

504
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,300
You said you wanted to
become a role model,

505
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:03,420
but have you ever considered my feelings?

506
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,023
Listen carefully.

507
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,519
I won’t allow you to
give up on your future.

508
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,720
You must be the champion
of the Flower Session.

509
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,919
And maybe, I could protect you
from the elder council.

510
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:24,650
In the future, if you embarrass
me again, I won’t let you off.

511
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,760
Leave.

512
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,767
The Gudiao has massive wings.

513
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:51,758
And its claws are sharper than swords.

514
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,719
I struck it with my sword
and it cried for help.

515
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,083
Sixth Senior is amazing indeed!

516
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,039
We’ll be the champion
for the Flower Session this time!

517
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,759
- That’s right!
- We’ll be number one!

518
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,981
- Right.
- Ling Long,

519
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:06,120
who will win if Sixth Senior and
Si Feng fight each other in the contest?

520
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,632
If Si Feng’s skill
level is as high as this,

521
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,723
Sixth Senior’s skill
level is as low as this.

522
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,331
So low?

523
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:21,439
Si Feng is that strong?

524
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,241
Ling Long, aren’t you
partaking in the contest as well?

525
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:26,079
What about your skill level?

526
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,879
Me?

527
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,120
It’s around...

528
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,599
It’s as high as that.

529
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,902
That high?

530
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,017
How could you partake in the contest
when you can’t even hold a sword?

531
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:44,759
- Idiots will be idiots.
- You called me an idiot? You!

532
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,515
- Ling Long.
- It’s obvious, isn’t it?

533
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,764
Or is it because there are
too many idiots in Shaoyang Sect?

534
00:34:48,765 --> 00:34:50,005
Is that why you don’t understand?

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,199
We must be magnanimous.

536
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,093
No matter how loud a dog
barks, it will always be an animal.

537
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,934
Us humans don’t need to
argue with animals.

538
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,253
- That’s right.
- You know how to speak, huh?

539
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:03,679
But that won’t work in the Flower Session.

540
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,239
I’ll make you kneel
in front of me by then!

541
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,319
We’ll make him kneel
in front of us in the arena.

542
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,319
Don’t worry.
I’ll turn him into a tortoise.

543
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,591
Great!

544
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,646
Let’s wait and see.

545
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,319
Look. How about that spot?

546
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,906
It provides a clear view
and it’s windy as well.

547
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:32,839
It’s the best spot.

548
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,999
Only your amazing Sixth Senior
can find a spot like that.

549
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,480
I noticed that spot long ago.
We don’t need you.

550
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,565
The Dianjinggu Sect has arrived.

551
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,426
<i>VALLEY MASTER OF DIANJINGGU SECT</i>

552
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:02,231
Ling Long.

553
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:05,199
It’s the sect of the rude Wu Tong.

554
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,480
Their sect won’t be the champion
since they have a disciple like him.

555
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,603
The Xuanyuan Sect has arrived.

556
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,520
Ling Long, why are there so
few people in the Xuanyuan Sect?

557
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,146
Xuanyuan Sect was
the best sect 100 years ago.

558
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:45,187
But their sect is
getting weaker and weaker.

559
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,169
And their sect leader isn’t here.

560
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
The Lize Palace has arrived.

561
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,816
It’s Si Feng’s sect.

562
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,840
Si Feng!

563
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:22,756
Si Feng!

564
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,987
Quiet down.

565
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,340
They hate to associate themselves
with outsiders.

566
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,399
You are causing trouble
for him by shouting his name.

567
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,599
Unlike you, he’s the sect leader’s
favourite disciple.

568
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,401
Hey, Master likes me as well.

569
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,880
The Lord and Madam
of Fuyu Island have arrived.

570
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,479
Ling Long.

571
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,040
What is everyone staring at?

572
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,533
- They...
- We’re staring at Madam Dong Fang.

573
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:10,094
Madam Dong Fang is the
most beautiful woman in the world.

574
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,119
Xuan Ji, you can’t tell
what’s beautiful and what’s not.

575
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,599
Look.

576
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,639
His eyes are popping out.

577
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,080
I... That’s not true.

578
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,835
The sect leader of Shaoyang Sect
has arrived.

579
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,276
- Father is here.
- Father.

580
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,600
The Flower Session has been
held for a few hundred years.

581
00:38:57,187 --> 00:39:02,188
The Five Great Sects
held this event every year

582
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,989
in order to promote justice
and righteousness.

583
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:09,199
The winner of this contest will be
the leader of the Five Great Sects

584
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,320
for the next four years.

585
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
Everyone here must treat this
as a spar and learn from others.

586
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,719
If anyone here disregards the rules
and harms others on purpose,

587
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,400
the five sect leaders will
have no mercy on them.

588
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,122
The Flower Session
will begin now.

589
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,560
Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace
will face Tu Ren from Fuyu Island.

590
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,599
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng! You can do it!

591
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,905
Si Feng!

592
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,612
Who’s that?

593
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,397
Looks like he’s over 30 years old.

594
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:08,651
Why is he in the contest?

595
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:10,199
That’s Senior Tu Ran from Fuyu Island.

596
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,198
My sword skills are ruthless.
I won’t show any mercy.

597
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,199
You won’t suffer if you surrender now.

598
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,360
Senior, please show me no mercy.

599
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,654
Dear, you don’t need to worry.

600
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:23,015
Tu Ran will definitely win.

601
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,163
Seems like Senior Tu Ran is quite strong.

602
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:39,724
Can Si Feng defeat him?

603
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,399
It’s more than that.

604
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,319
Senior Tu Ran was the favourite
candidate four years ago.

605
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,079
But he missed the contest because
he wanted to train his Lightning Sword.

606
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,586
Look at the lightning contained
within his sword.

607
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:56,737
I’m sure he has mastered it.

608
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:59,159
Even an experienced warrior
might not be able to

609
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,919
win against him easily.

610
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,080
Si Feng is facing a tough opponent.

611
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,440
- Si Feng! You can do it!
- Si Feng! You can do it!

612
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,902
Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace is the victor!

613
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:46,943
- Si Feng won!
- This is great!

614
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,737
- Si Feng, you’re amazing!
- Yes!

615
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,440
That disciple from Lize
Palace is outstanding indeed.

616
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,078
It seemed like he didn’t even
give his best.

617
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,146
Little Six, if you face
Si Feng in the future,

618
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:09,239
you should just give up.

619
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,839
You should surrender.

620
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,161
My Yaohua sword moves
aren’t that weak, you know?

621
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:14,415
Next round,

622
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:17,816
Wu Tong from Dianjinggu Sect
will face Lin Feng from Xuanyuan Sect.

623
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,849
I didn’t expect him
to be that powerful.

624
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,340
He’s too much!

625
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:28,427
He doesn’t need to destroy
the weapon of his opponent!

626
00:43:33,248 --> 00:43:35,968
Wu Tong from Dianjinggu Sect
is the victor!
