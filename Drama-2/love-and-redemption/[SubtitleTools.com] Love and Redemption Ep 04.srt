1
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,850
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>EPISODE 4</i>

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,986
Si Feng, leave with him!

4
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,124
Hurry!

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,639
- Ling Long!
- Xuan Ji!

6
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,040
Let go of my sister!

7
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,399
Xuan Ji!

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,679
Xuan Ji!

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,799
Xuan Ji!

10
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,119
Troublesome girl.

11
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,480
Ling Long!

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,605
Ling Long and Xuan Ji are in trouble!

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,467
Let’s go!

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,599
Chu Ling Long, show
me what you’re capable of.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,882
If you’re the reincarnation
of the God of War or Star of Mosha,

16
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:25,919
you’ll be able to escape this.

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,761
If you perish under this spell,

18
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,842
that means you’re not
the person we’re looking for.

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,160
Ling Long!

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
Try and escape!

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
Ling Long!

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
Try and escape this!

23
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,000
Ling Long!

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,399
- Ling Long, are you okay?
- I’m fine.

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,680
I was so scared!

26
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
It’s Senior Hao Chen.

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,555
Si Feng!

28
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:04,559
Are you okay?

29
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,853
We’re fine.

30
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,134
What about the merman?

31
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,359
The merman...

32
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,507
The demons took him away.

33
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,679
Hero Yu, I know the Lize Palace
has a different way of doing things,

34
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,599
and other sects didn’t interfere as well,

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,519
but you brought my fellow juniors
to save that demon.

36
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,822
I don’t think that’s suitable.

37
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:26,477
We wanted to save him ourselves.

38
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:28,027
The merman didn’t harm anyone.

39
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:29,624
He even helped us in the cave.

40
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,134
How could you pity a demon?

41
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:32,535
You mustn’t have thoughts like that.

42
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,479
But...

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,920
Seniors, thank you for saving me.

44
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,236
I know my fault now.

45
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,484
It’s fine.

46
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,519
Maybe the demons left some tracks.

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,159
Hao Chen, let’s scout the area.

48
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,364
Yes.

49
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,040
Si Feng, did the demons
really take him away?

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,948
Follow me.

51
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
What spell is this?

52
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,319
This is Lize Palace’s spell of deceit.

53
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,069
- It can hide any scent or figure.
- Are you okay?

54
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,319
That’s why no one discovered him.

55
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
Hurry, bring him to the riverside.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,080
Are you in pain?

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,320
I have some medicine here.

58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,760
Why are you laughing?

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

60
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,147
Do we know each other?

61
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
We don’t know each other in this lifetime.

62
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,960
But now, we know each other.

63
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
You know how to speak?

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,799
You were captured by the demons.

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,021
What did they want to do?

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,272
The entire demon tribe
is gathering at Sky Hall.

67
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,759
They’re trying to find the spirit keys.

68
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,133
Spirit keys?

69
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,919
What are those?

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,399
Your sect leaders will know.

71
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,360
I don’t know about anything else.

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,319
You mustn’t speak.

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,880
You’re severely injured.
You need to recuperate in the sea.

74
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,550
Regarding the news that you’ve told us,

75
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,065
I will send an anonymous letter

76
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,426
in order to remind the Five Great Sects.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,134
Do you feel better now?

78
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,520
He’s crying?

79
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Their tears do become pearls?

80
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,439
If you hold a Merman’s Tear
under your tongue, you’ll cry.

81
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,239
And only a few people
know about this secret.

82
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,479
They won’t find out.

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,360
That’s great! Xuan Ji won’t need to
stay in Mingxia Cave again!

84
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,862
You can try.

85
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,359
Ling Long, look!

86
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
- I’m crying! I know how to cry!
- Xuan Ji!

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,320
Xuan Ji, this is great!

88
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,159
You two are so silly.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Stop mocking us.
You’re the silly one here.

90
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
He’s thanking us.

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Xuan Ji, that’s beautiful.

92
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,613
This is just like how I felt
after I ate some sweet snacks.

93
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:57,999
It’s sweet. I feel happy.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,152
Si Feng, thank you.

95
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,466
Thank you for the Merman’s Tear as well.

96
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,119
You don’t need to thank me.

97
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
It’s a gift from the merman.

98
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,663
You said that everything
happens for a reason.

99
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,519
You accumulated good karma
after you saved him.

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,813
And this is your reward.

101
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,296
Chu Xuan Ji, if you want
to recover your six senses

102
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:25,839
and acquire genuine tears,
you should collect the shards.

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,160
What shards?

104
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,716
Shards of the Mirror of Origin.

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,839
Mirror of Origin is the immortal item
of the immortal, Xi Wangmu.

106
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,346
It can reveal the origin
of everything in the world.

107
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:40,479
Xi Wangmu shattered the mirror
and scattered them in the human realm.

108
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,720
Collect all the shards, and
you’ll recover your six senses.

109
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,989
I found one in the secret ground.

110
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,030
And I recovered my taste.

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,119
Is that the Mirror of Origin?

112
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,719
Did I recover my taste
because of the Mirror of Origin?

113
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,919
Only the Mirror of Origin
is capable of such feat.

114
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,399
Not only that,

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,359
you’ll know your true identity
after you collect all of them.

116
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,959
My true identity?

117
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,622
I’m Chu Xuan Ji. Who else can I be?

118
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,279
You are you, yet you are not.

119
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,799
Maybe it’s for the best
if you don’t know the whole truth.

120
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,280
But this is your fate.

121
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,479
Chu Xuan Ji, I wish you luck.

122
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Maybe we’ll meet in the future.

123
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,159
I think the merman can
swim back to the sea from here.

124
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,680
Speaking of which,
I haven’t seen the sea before.

125
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Si Feng, Lize Palace is
located beside the sea, right?

126
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,839
How about we meet up
with Si Feng in Lize Palace next time?

127
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,599
Sure!

128
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,280
Women are not allowed in Lize Palace.

129
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,158
I only know that they
don’t accept any female disciple.

130
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,893
But women are not allowed inside?

131
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,719
Are you guys going to stay single forever?

132
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
We won’t be able to marry anyone
after we enter Lize Palace.

133
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,128
Is that why everyone in Lize
Palace needs to wear a mask?

134
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,899
But Si Feng, your mask was removed.

135
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,879
We’ve seen your real face as well.

136
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,080
Don’t tell me the people
who had seen your face need to marry you?

137
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,639
- I’m done for.
- Marry?

138
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,623
I saw your real face.

139
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:26,239
- That means I need to...
- Little Six, you’re overthinking.

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,159
All of us saw his real face, you know?

141
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,719
Besides, Xuan Ji was the first person
to see his real face.

142
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,608
It has nothing to do with you.
Si Feng, am I right?

143
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,279
Such rule doesn’t exist.

144
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,496
It’s just that...

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
I’ll owe someone a favour.

146
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,611
Owe someone a favour?

147
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:48,639
Are you talking about the merman?

148
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,031
- We saved him of our own accord.
- That’s right.

149
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:53,800
We support each other
through thick and thin.

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,880
Father told me that favours
don’t matter in friendship,

151
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,961
only loyalty matters.

152
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,569
Friendship.

153
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,759
In the past, no one told
me about these things.

154
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
It was my first time
hearing these strange thoughts.

155
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,679
Why don’t you join Shaoyang Sect?
That way, we won’t be separated.

156
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Maybe we can drink in secret every day.

157
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,320
Come, check out this amazing wine.

158
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,600
The speciality of Mount Lutai, fruit wine.

159
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,226
Since we’re going to be friends forever,

160
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,191
let’s finish this drink together.

161
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,424
- Great!
- Great!

162
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,574
Sure.

163
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,603
Cheers.

164
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,799
Xuan Ji, don’t worry.

165
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,679
We will help you find the shards
of Mirror of Origin.

166
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,599
If we train hard enough
and travel around the world,

167
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,439
I’m sure we’ll find them.

168
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,538
By then, not only will you taste the wine,
you’ll enjoy the fragrance as well.

169
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:01,479
And we’ll be able to see
a Xuan Ji who’s afraid of pain.

170
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,095
That’s right. No matter
what’s your true identity,

171
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:08,264
it’s fine because we know who you are.

172
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,734
After I find the Mirror of Origin,
I’ll be able to recover my six senses.

173
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,960
And I will become like everybody else.

174
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,232
No matter what happens in the future,
I just want to

175
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,667
stay together with everyone and be happy.

176
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,028
That’ll be great.

177
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

178
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,800
Chu Ling Long wasn’t
the person we’re looking for.

179
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,479
I will try to test the others
who have the same birth date

180
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,279
as the reincarnations of
the God of War and the Star of Mosha.

181
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,004
We wouldn’t need to go through
all these troubles

182
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:44,109
if you all didn’t lose track
of their reincarnations

183
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,310
at Fenru City 16 years ago.

184
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,456
It was our fault.

185
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,399
My lord, don’t worry.

186
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,469
I’ll find out the location
of the spirit keys as soon as possible.

187
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,470
I’ll find out where
the Five Great Sects had hidden them.

188
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,789
We’ll save Left Lieutenant and assist
you in retrieving the Divine Weapon.

189
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,561
We’ll summon the Star of Mosha

190
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,562
and dominate the three realms once again.

191
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:09,039
Si Feng,

192
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,039
if we talk about fate, it seems that
you have an affinity with Xuan Ji.

193
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,920
You two were born on the same day.

194
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,920
Even I couldn’t compare with that.

195
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:23,748
Since you’re twins, why weren’t
you born at the same time?

196
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,119
We’re twins.

197
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,759
But Xuan Ji was a lazy girl.

198
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,010
She didn’t want to come out.

199
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:34,479
She stayed in our mother’s belly
for another night.

200
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,428
That’s why I was born at 9 at night
on the fourth day of the fourth month,

201
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,680
while she was born at 1 in the morning
on the fifth day of the fourth month.

202
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,548
So that’s the case.

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
You’re hungry again?

204
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,519
You’re hungry?
I’ll catch some fishes and cook them.

205
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,359
Great idea. I’ll join you.

206
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,206
Little Six, you better catch a big fish.

207
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,457
Okay.

208
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,974
Xuan Ji, I thought you had just eaten?

209
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,695
I don’t know what’s going on either.

210
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,530
Isn’t this the book you used when
Mother taught us how to write our names?

211
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,790
You kept it with you?

212
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,462
I knew our Xuan Ji wasn’t emotionless

213
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,263
even though you couldn’t shed any tears.

214
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,599
Mother told me to write down the names
of those who are important to me.

215
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,478
Can I see who’s included?

216
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,798
Sure.

217
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,199
Father.

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,919
Mother.

219
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,241
Ling Long.

220
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,539
That’s all?

221
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,516
Who else do you want to be included?

222
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,917
You can write down the name
of the person you like.

223
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,786
These are all the people I like.

224
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,392
It’s not that.

225
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,119
I’m not talking about our family.

226
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,536
If you like someone,
you wish to see him every day.

227
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:52,799
And you want to be with him at all times.

228
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,959
You’ll share your secrets with him.

229
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,402
And he’ll directly affect
your mood as well.

230
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,805
He...

231
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,080
Ling Long, do you
have someone you like?

232
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,000
I...

233
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
I... I’ll check
how they’re doing!

234
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,760
If I like someone, I’ll
share my secrets with him?

235
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,569
I’m so hungry.

236
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,400
Why isn’t Sixth Senior here yet?

237
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,738
Xuan Ji, this is a secret between us.

238
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,341
You mustn’t tell anyone else.

239
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,389
So, the person whom I wish
to meet and share secrets with,

240
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,999
that’s the person I like.

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
I do have similarities
with other people as well.

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,968
Ling Long said I must write his name down.

243
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,653
<i>SIXTH SENIOR</i>

244
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,879
Xuan Ji.

245
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,890
- Sixth Senior.
- We caught many fishes.

246
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,472
- You’ll be able to eat soon.
- Okay.

247
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,631
Oh right, I picked the same gift
for you and Ling Long.

248
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:37,628
But seems like Ling Long doesn’t like it.

249
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,041
I’ll give them to you then.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,082
Maybe it’s because I’m too dumb.

251
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,803
I always give her something
she doesn’t like.

252
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,959
Maybe it’s because other people
don’t like me as well.

253
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,720
Not at all. Sixth Senior, I like you.

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,719
What?

255
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,419
You’re the person that I like.

256
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
Silly girl, what do you know?

257
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,345
Little Six, come here.

258
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,266
- Help us with the fishes.
- Coming.

259
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,413
You can cook it with her.

260
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,796
Hurry up.

261
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
- Si Feng.
- What is this?

262
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,024
Sixth Senior gave me this.

263
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,960
Si Feng, what colour is it?

264
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,144
It’s blue.

265
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,160
This is blue?

266
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,763
My favourite colour is blue then.

267
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,560
Is it fragrant and nice?

268
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,200
It’s not, and it’s hideous.

269
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,609
Really?

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,249
I’ll be able to feel that for myself
when I recover my six senses.

271
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,123
By the way, Si Feng,
we’ll return to Mount Shaoyang tomorrow.

272
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:03,489
After we meet Father,
I’ll tell you about how

273
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,410
we can avoid the Candle Dragon
and retrieve your mask.

274
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:12,281
Xuan Ji, actually,
this is dangerous.

275
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,442
Maybe Sect Leader Chu would find out.

276
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:17,021
You don’t need to force yourself
if it’s too hard.

277
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,559
Since I didn’t manage to
obtain Gudiao’s horns for you.

278
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,159
It’s no problem. Friends
shouldn’t be so calculative.

279
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,439
I promised you I’ll do so.

280
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,680
That’s why I’ll do anything
to help you retrieve your mask.

281
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,168
Silly girl.

282
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
It was hard for you
to escape Mingxia Cave, you know?

283
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,039
Actually, it’s fine even if
I lose the mask.

284
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,520
You don’t need to find it
and you don’t need to return there.

285
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,680
Is it really fine?

286
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,029
It’s fine.

287
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,247
Xuan Ji,

288
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,657
thank you.

289
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,125
Uncle.

290
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,342
Master.

291
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,319
Father.

292
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,659
We’re back.

293
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,380
Who gave you permission to return here?

294
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,781
You’re getting out of control.

295
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,918
Father, please don’t blame Sister.

296
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,639
It’s my fault.

297
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,254
I only understood many things
after I went down the mountain.

298
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:52,224
It was all my fault. I was disobedient.

299
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:55,062
Now, I know the reason
you scolded me in the past.

300
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,918
You did the right thing.

301
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,799
I won’t act like this again.

302
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,160
Father.

303
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,331
Great.

304
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,159
Good girl.

305
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,881
Seems like you understood my intentions.

306
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,039
My effort was not in vain.

307
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,321
I’m sure your mother would
be relieved to hear this.

308
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,028
So, Xuan Ji doesn’t need to
enter Mingxia Cave again.

309
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:18,709
I feel relieved.

310
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,919
Xuan Ji, this is great!

311
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,075
Xuan Ji, you should return and rest first.

312
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:34,051
Little Six and I will send some
local specialities to the other members.

313
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,919
We’ll find you after that, okay?

314
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,865
- Okay.
- See you.

315
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:39,152
Little Six, let’s go.

316
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,464
Merman’s Tear is useful indeed.

317
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:46,850
Senior Hao Chen.

318
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,920
Don’t worry. I’m the only one
who knows about this.

319
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,963
Xuan Ji, let me ask you this.

320
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:54,404
Do you really want to train yourself?

321
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,239
In the past, I had no reason to do so.

322
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,242
But after the incident at Mount Lutai,

323
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:04,440
I realized that I need to train hard
to protect those I want to protect.

324
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,599
That’s good.

325
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,959
Xuan Ji, actually,
you’re as good as anyone else.

326
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,807
If there’s a chance for you
to learn great spells

327
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:17,039
and become a powerful
cultivator, will you grab the chance?

328
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,955
Senior Hao Chen, are you mocking me?

329
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:23,559
I don’t even have the right
to attend the Flower Session.

330
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,820
There’s no rush.

331
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,159
Think about it for now.

332
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,879
We’ll talk about that
after the Flower Session.

333
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,371
Now, we should celebrate
our return from Mount Lutai.

334
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,253
Si Feng doesn’t want me
to retrieve the mask,

335
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:40,534
but I’ve made a promise with him.

336
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
I must keep my words.

337
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,279
I can’t enter the secret ground by myself.

338
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,640
If I use spells, the barrier
will respond to them.

339
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,793
Si Feng!

340
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,239
Si Feng!

341
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,866
Xuan Ji? Why are you here?

342
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,159
I’m here to help you.

343
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,639
Didn’t I tell you not to help me?

344
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,240
You’ll be punished by your father
if he finds out.

345
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,425
But you’ll be punished
if you don’t retrieve your mask.

346
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,661
Follow me.

347
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,891
The Candle Dragon is hiding here.

348
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,799
If we alert it, it’ll activate
the protection rock.

349
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,560
It’s fine. There’s a way
we could sneak past it.

350
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,119
Look. We’ll use this.

351
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,339
This Lightning Truncheon can only
teleport one person at a time.

352
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,949
But there are two of us here.

353
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,670
Just treat the two of us
as one individual then.

354
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,880
Don’t move. I’m going to cast the spell.

355
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
Look! I told you it would work.

356
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,646
Si Feng.

357
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,080
Let’s find your mask now.

358
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
Si Feng, your mask!

359
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
My mask.

360
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,206
Si Feng!

361
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,001
Si Feng, it’s fine.
We can come again tomorrow.

362
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,880
We’ll find the other half of the mask
and glue it back together.

363
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,680
Maybe the item broke

364
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,997
while we fought the Candle Dragon.

365
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,459
The masks in Lize Palace can’t be fixed.

366
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,079
Fate has decided for my mask to be broken.

367
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,200
We’ll just forget about it.

368
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,040
I need to meet my master now.

369
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,460
Do you still have respect for me?

370
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,279
Master.

371
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,559
Si Feng, you were distracted
by your feelings.

372
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,480
You even forgot about the 13 Abstinence!

373
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,935
You should return and receive
your punishment for your mistake.

374
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,880
What a great disciple indeed.

375
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Master, I’ve let you down.
Please punish me.

376
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,281
Si Feng!

377
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,562
Si Feng, are you okay?

378
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,838
Xuan Ji, this is their internal affair.

379
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,160
You mustn’t interrupt.

380
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,189
Si Feng, you only said you let me down.

381
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,959
But you didn’t admit your mistake.

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,320
Do you know your mistake?

383
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,800
I removed his mask. You should
punish me instead of him.

384
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,460
Xuan Ji!

385
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,174
My lord, Xuan Ji is young and ignorant.

386
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,490
Please forgive her for her rudeness.

387
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:08,436
Did I say anything wrong? He didn’t remove
the mask of his own accord.

388
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:11,598
Moreover, he almost lost his life
trying to retrieve the mask.

389
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,440
Si Feng’s life and the mask,
which is more important to you?

390
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,321
Such audacity! This is
the internal affair of Lize Palace!

391
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:21,595
You have no right to say anything!

392
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,733
Xuan Ji, this has nothing to do with you.

393
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,543
Hurry and apologise to the palace lord.

394
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,798
Lize Palace’s internal affairs
have nothing to do with me indeed.

395
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,159
But he’s my best friend, and
I will do something about this.

396
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,940
You can’t answer my questions,
yet you’re trying to punish Si Feng.

397
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:36,581
I’m just trying to seek an answer.

398
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,239
I’m envious of Sect Leader Chu
for having a daughter like her.

399
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,537
Si Feng.

400
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,079
This girl is trying so hard to help you.

401
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,785
I’m very surprised.

402
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:55,440
What? Have you made new friends
after only a few days?

403
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,790
Yes. In the past, I never
knew what a friend was.

404
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,957
But now, I understand the
profound sentiments of friendship.

405
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,520
What? Profound sentiments of friendship?

406
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,423
My lord, the other sect leaders
are waiting for you for the meeting.

407
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:30,024
Please don’t delay this any longer.

408
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,894
My lord, please.

409
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,120
Profound sentiments of friendship.

410
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,680
Si Feng, get up now.

411
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,959
Does it hurt?

412
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,206
I’m fine.

413
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,230
Why did you try to save me
from my master’s punishment?

414
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:03,519
You’re reckless indeed.

415
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,319
I’m fine. I’m just afraid that
he’ll punish you for my mistake.

416
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,160
Si Feng, will he punish you?

417
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,559
I’ll be fine.

418
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,810
Don’t worry.

419
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,629
That’s good to hear.

420
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,479
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

421
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,614
Everyone, these are the Demon Collars

422
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:31,265
that we found on Gudiao and Tengu.

423
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:35,199
Besides that, we’ve received
an anonymous letter as well.

424
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,160
It states that the demon tribe
is manipulating

425
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,278
both of the beasts mentioned.

426
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,949
And Sky Hall is the name
of the demon tribe’s organisation.

427
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,560
Has anyone heard of this news?

428
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,039
Sky Hall?

429
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,298
It doesn’t ring a bell.

430
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,639
An anonymous letter
without any proves or evidences.

431
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Sect Leader Chu, you don’t need to
take it seriously.

432
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,439
That’s right.

433
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,234
The demon tribe was defeated
in the war 1,000 years ago.

434
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:05,559
Why should we be afraid?

435
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,599
I’m sure it’s only some minor demons
trying to cause a ruckus.

436
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,471
There’s no need for us to worry.

437
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:14,032
I’m afraid things aren’t that simple.

438
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,643
If the content of the anonymous
letter is true, the demon tribe

439
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:23,084
will try to obtain the five spirit keys
that the Five Great Sects are protecting.

440
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:26,079
Spirit keys?

441
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,459
What are you talking about?

442
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,038
Has anyone ever heard of that?

443
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,102
That concerns the very existence
of our sects.

444
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,184
I don’t think we should
discuss it in public.

445
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:38,759
If the content is fake, I’m afraid it
would cause us to turn against each other.

446
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,359
Valley Master Rong is right.

447
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,640
In my opinion,

448
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:45,040
Sect Leader Chu, you should focus on
handling the Flower Session.

449
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,253
Farewell.

450
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:58,695
<i>SHOUYANG HALL</i>

451
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,600
I didn’t expect the sects
to be divided among themselves

452
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,872
after I went for my training.

453
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,357
I hope the other sects
will be ready for this.

454
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:15,870
And act more cautiously.

455
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,640
I hope I’m the one
overthinking here.

456
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,359
Si Feng!

457
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,801
Si Feng!

458
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,355
- Why are you here?
- Si Feng.

459
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,719
Why are you here? Is he
still insisting on punishing you?

460
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,639
But why? I’ll argue with him.

461
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,079
You mustn’t. My master has a bad temper.

462
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,599
He won’t let you off.

463
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,319
There’s nothing to fear. At most,
he’ll just give me a beating.

464
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,719
He’s too brave for his own good.
He broke our rules.

465
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,695
You should consider your position
before you try to imitate him.

466
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,359
He’s doing this because
he has a strong backing.

467
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,320
Our lord won’t let others off that easily.

468
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,919
Return now.

469
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,639
I’m kneeling here of my own accord.

470
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,945
My master didn’t punish me.

471
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:31,380
Why?

472
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,101
He’ll only be appeased if I do so.

473
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,640
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

474
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,519
Oh right, Si Feng, I brought
you some dried fruits.

475
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,599
They’re very sweet.
Since you’re doing this,

476
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,840
you should have some sweet stuff
in order to ease your pain. Here.

477
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,707
Is it delicious?

478
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,559
I’ll take this for now.

479
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,079
You should leave.

480
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,467
Remember to eat them.

481
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,170
Look. The Flower Session
hasn’t even started,

482
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:34,220
yet Chu Lei is trying to show that
he’s the leader of the Five Great Sects.

483
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,501
Don’t tell me Shaoyang Sect
will be the champion again?

484
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,507
Ask Shi Feng to prepare himself.

485
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:42,423
We need to be the champion no matter what.

486
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:46,246
The Xuanyuan Sect should be
the leader of the Five Great Sects!

487
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:47,437
Yes.

488
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,237
Follow me.

489
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,905
Master.

490
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,195
Master?

491
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,719
Isn’t friendship the only thing you need?

492
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,533
You don’t need me anymore.

493
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:22,799
I don’t dare to do so.

494
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,440
I’ve broken the rules.
I’m willing to accept my punishment.

495
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,129
Those who can’t keep
their true nature in check

496
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,586
will be judged by the elder council.

497
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:34,449
And receive the 13 Punishments
in Lianyu Pagoda.

498
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,786
I’m afraid you can’t
endure all of the punishments.

499
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:40,719
As your head disciple,
I should be a role model for others.

500
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,952
- I won’t escape.
- You!

501
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,640
Look at you now.

502
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,472
You are the most outstanding disciple

503
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,912
I had in Lize Palace
for the past few hundred years.

504
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,300
You said you wanted to
become a role model,

505
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,420
but have you ever considered my feelings?

506
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,023
Listen carefully.

507
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,519
I won’t allow you to
give up on your future.

508
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,720
You must be the champion
of the Flower Session.

509
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,919
And maybe, I could protect you
from the elder council.

510
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,650
In the future, if you embarrass
me again, I won’t let you off.

511
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
Leave.

512
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,767
The Gudiao has massive wings.

513
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,758
And its claws are sharper than swords.

514
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:57,719
I struck it with my sword
and it cried for help.

515
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,083
Sixth Senior is amazing indeed!

516
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,039
We’ll be the champion
for the Flower Session this time!

517
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,759
- That’s right!
- We’ll be number one!

518
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,981
- Right.
- Ling Long,

519
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:08,120
who will win if Sixth Senior and
Si Feng fight each other in the contest?

520
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,632
If Si Feng’s skill
level is as high as this,

521
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:17,723
Sixth Senior’s skill
level is as low as this.

522
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,331
So low?

523
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:23,439
Si Feng is that strong?

524
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,241
Ling Long, aren’t you
partaking in the contest as well?

525
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:28,079
What about your skill level?

526
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,879
Me?

527
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,120
It’s around...

528
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:34,599
It’s as high as that.

529
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,902
That high?

530
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,017
How could you partake in the contest
when you can’t even hold a sword?

531
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,759
- Idiots will be idiots.
- You called me an idiot? You!

532
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,515
- Ling Long.
- It’s obvious, isn’t it?

533
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:50,764
Or is it because there are
too many idiots in Shaoyang Sect?

534
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,005
Is that why you don’t understand?

535
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,199
We must be magnanimous.

536
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,093
No matter how loud a dog
barks, it will always be an animal.

537
00:35:58,094 --> 00:35:59,934
Us humans don’t need to
argue with animals.

538
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,253
- That’s right.
- You know how to speak, huh?

539
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:05,679
But that won’t work in the Flower Session.

540
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,239
I’ll make you kneel
in front of me by then!

541
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,319
We’ll make him kneel
in front of us in the arena.

542
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,319
Don’t worry.
I’ll turn him into a tortoise.

543
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,591
Great!

544
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,646
Let’s wait and see.

545
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,319
Look. How about that spot?

546
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,906
It provides a clear view
and it’s windy as well.

547
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,839
It’s the best spot.

548
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,999
Only your amazing Sixth Senior
can find a spot like that.

549
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
I noticed that spot long ago.
We don’t need you.

550
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,565
The Dianjinggu Sect has arrived.

551
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:51,426
<i>VALLEY MASTER OF DIANJINGGU SECT</i>

552
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:04,231
Ling Long.

553
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:07,199
It’s the sect of the rude Wu Tong.

554
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,480
Their sect won’t be the champion
since they have a disciple like him.

555
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:21,603
The Xuanyuan Sect has arrived.

556
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,520
Ling Long, why are there so
few people in the Xuanyuan Sect?

557
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:45,146
Xuanyuan Sect was
the best sect 100 years ago.

558
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:47,187
But their sect is
getting weaker and weaker.

559
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,169
And their sect leader isn’t here.

560
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,480
The Lize Palace has arrived.

561
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,816
It’s Si Feng’s sect.

562
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,840
Si Feng!

563
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,756
Si Feng!

564
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,987
Quiet down.

565
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:34,340
They hate to associate themselves
with outsiders.

566
00:38:34,341 --> 00:38:36,399
You are causing trouble
for him by shouting his name.

567
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,599
Unlike you, he’s the sect leader’s
favourite disciple.

568
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,401
Hey, Master likes me as well.

569
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,880
The Lord and Madam
of Fuyu Island have arrived.

570
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,479
Ling Long.

571
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,040
What is everyone staring at?

572
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,533
- They...
- We’re staring at Madam Dong Fang.

573
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:12,094
Madam Dong Fang is the
most beautiful woman in the world.

574
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,119
Xuan Ji, you can’t tell
what’s beautiful and what’s not.

575
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,599
Look.

576
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,639
His eyes are popping out.

577
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,080
I... That’s not true.

578
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,835
The sect leader of Shaoyang Sect
has arrived.

579
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:29,276
- Father is here.
- Father.

580
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,600
The Flower Session has been
held for a few hundred years.

581
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:04,188
The Five Great Sects
held this event every year

582
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,989
in order to promote justice
and righteousness.

583
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:11,199
The winner of this contest will be
the leader of the Five Great Sects

584
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,320
for the next four years.

585
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,880
Everyone here must treat this
as a spar and learn from others.

586
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,719
If anyone here disregards the rules
and harms others on purpose,

587
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
the five sect leaders will
have no mercy on them.

588
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,122
The Flower Session
will begin now.

589
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace
will face Tu Ren from Fuyu Island.

590
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,599
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng! You can do it!

591
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,905
Si Feng!

592
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,612
Who’s that?

593
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,397
Looks like he’s over 30 years old.

594
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:10,651
Why is he in the contest?

595
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:12,199
That’s Senior Tu Ran from Fuyu Island.

596
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,198
My sword skills are ruthless.
I won’t show any mercy.

597
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,199
You won’t suffer if you surrender now.

598
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,360
Senior, please show me no mercy.

599
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,654
Dear, you don’t need to worry.

600
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:25,015
Tu Ran will definitely win.

601
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,163
Seems like Senior Tu Ran is quite strong.

602
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,724
Can Si Feng defeat him?

603
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,399
It’s more than that.

604
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,319
Senior Tu Ran was the favourite
candidate four years ago.

605
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,079
But he missed the contest because
he wanted to train his Lightning Sword.

606
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,586
Look at the lightning contained
within his sword.

607
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,737
I’m sure he has mastered it.

608
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:01,159
Even an experienced warrior
might not be able to

609
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,919
win against him easily.

610
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,080
Si Feng is facing a tough opponent.

611
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,440
- Si Feng! You can do it!
- Si Feng! You can do it!

612
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,902
Yu Si Feng from Lize Palace is the victor!

613
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:48,943
- Si Feng won!
- This is great!

614
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,737
- Si Feng, you’re amazing!
- Yes!

615
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
That disciple from Lize
Palace is outstanding indeed.

616
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,078
It seemed like he didn’t even
give his best.

617
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,146
Little Six, if you face
Si Feng in the future,

618
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:11,239
you should just give up.

619
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,839
You should surrender.

620
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,161
My Yaohua sword moves
aren’t that weak, you know?

621
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:16,415
Next round,

622
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:19,816
Wu Tong from Dianjinggu Sect
will face Lin Feng from Xuanyuan Sect.

623
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,849
I didn’t expect him
to be that powerful.

624
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,340
He’s too much!

625
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:30,427
He doesn’t need to destroy
the weapon of his opponent!

626
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,968
Wu Tong from Dianjinggu Sect
is the victor!
