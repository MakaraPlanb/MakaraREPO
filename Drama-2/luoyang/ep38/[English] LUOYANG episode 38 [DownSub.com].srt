00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,910
Thank you, sir.

191
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,030
The Baili family

192
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,990
has caused so much trouble.

193
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,710
The famine in Luoyang

194
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,870
was caused by Baili Kuanren.

195
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,750
And yet you're here to buy rice! You're shameless!

196
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,070
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,390
What are you doing?

198
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,270
What do you want?

199
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
The Baili family colluded with Four Season Clan

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,990
and killed my parents.

201
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,270
I want to bring you to justice!

202
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,950
Stop it!

203
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,430
What are you doing?

204
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,830
What Baili Kuanren did

205
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,150
has nothing to do with them.

206
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,510
You are all men, and yet

207
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,550
you're bullying two vulnerable women.

208
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,310
Have you no shame?

209
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,990
Even if they've got nothing to do with it,

210
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,190
the master of the house

211
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,190
is Baili Hongyi.

212
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,910
He's always been eccentric.

213
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,270
If you ask me, the Clan might be established

214
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,910
by him and his brother together.

215
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,670
Yeah, you're right.

216
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,660
Nonsense!

217
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,310
You're all talking nonsense.

218
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,950
Do you know

219
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,230
what Hongyi has done

220
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,910
to destroy Four Season Clan?

221
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,110
The Clan

222
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,110
ruined his family.

223
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,710
He had already gotten his revenge

224
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,670
and could've left you alone.

225
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,190
However, Hongyi

226
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,190
would do

227
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,310
what he thinks is right

228
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,670
at all costs.

229
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,470
That's...

230
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,070
That's the real Hongyi.

231
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,990
None of you

232
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,190
get to speak ill of him.

233
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,230
She has a point.

234
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,500
Baili Kuanren had long been

235
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,590
disconnected from the Baili family.

236
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,190
Those were some nice words,

237
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,110
but what on earth

238
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,270
has Baili Hongyi done?

239
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,350
I heard that

240
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,470
he went to see Her Majesty

241
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,710
and reported his own brother.

242
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,670
That could count as selfless behavior.

243
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,550
Yeah.

244
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,470
Baili Kuanren has been executed.

245
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,310
The famine

246
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,710
has taken a toll on all of us.

247
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,030
What we need to do now is to fight together.

248
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,870
Besides,

249
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,990
the stolen grain

250
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,870
has been found.

251
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,710
Tomorrow,

252
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,630
Her Majesty will open the granaries herself.

253
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,830
Hang in there, folks.

254
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,350
We'll overcome this hurdle together.

255
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,510
Great.

256
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,630
Her Majesty is going to send us grain herself.

257
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,310
We don't need to worry about food anymore.

258
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,030
It's not manly of us

259
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,470
to blame these two ladies.

260
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,150
Yeah.

261
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,270
This is great!

262
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,990
Great!

263
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,670
Great!

264
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,460
Luoyang is experiencing turbulent times.

265
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,940
You should stay home if possible.

266
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,590
I am worried about Hongyi right now.

267
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,790
Hurtful rumors

268
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,950
are spreading.

269
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,350
If he heard these rumors,

270
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,830
he'd feel upset.

271
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,030
He's done

272
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,390
what he should and could do.

273
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,270
He shall ignore all those rumors.

274
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:18,830
Liu Ran,

275
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,510
I have a favor to ask.

276
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,950
What?

277
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,870
Hongyi,

278
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,870
you haven't eaten anything for a whole day.

279
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,430
Have some food, okay?

280
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,590
Liu Ran, sorry I dragged you into all this.

281
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,470
I am fine.

282
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,790
Hongyi,

283
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,630
there is sufficient grain in Luoyang now.

284
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,830
You don't need to worry anymore.

285
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,270
Hongyi,

286
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,510
let's take a trip, shall we?

287
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,350
Didn't you say that

288
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,790
you want to visit

289
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,190

290
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,790
We can go together

291
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,070
and enjoy the beautiful country
 outside Luoyang.

292
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,060

Liu Ran,

I should've taken sole responsibility

295
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,830
for what happened with my brother.

296
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,340
I dragged you into the chaos.

297
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,430
Hongyi,

298
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,230
we are a couple.

299
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,590
It's good that

300
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,750
we can share our burdens.

306
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,790
you built a secret chamber here?

307
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,710
They were sinners.

308
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,750
I can't pay tribute to them in public.

309
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,390

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,390

[Spiritual tablets of Wu Siyue and Wu Youjue's parents]

They were royals,

but they were kind and honest.

318
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,550
Our parents were kind to others,

but others took their kindness

320
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
as their weakness.

321
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,790
They were robbed of fields and houses
 by their own family.

322

How dare they?

I didn't know you've been holding
 so much hatred in your heart.

I don't blame you for not understanding me.

330

It's because you didn't see

331
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,790
how miserable our parents were before they died.

332
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,990
Back then,

You were a baby who needed food and care,

but I couldn't give you anything.

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,470
Siyue, it was at that moment

342
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,750
that I made up my mind

343
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,540
that I'd take revenge for our parents' death.

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,670

How could you have this thought?

Her Majesty trusts you so much.

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,870
She's loved me dearly since I was little.

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,270
because we've been putting our lives at risk.

364
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,390

365
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,710
I need to tell you one more thing.

366
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,390
I am in such poor health

367
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,230
because I poisoned myself.

I went to ask the King of Jin for help,

375
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,230
but he said there was nothing he could do.

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,310
It has to be a good-looking man

379
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,190
from a noble family

380
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,430
who's younger than 17.

381
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,790
Any young man in a nice family

382
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,950
wouldn't risk his life for that job.

383
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,750
You're right.

384
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,630
You want to become a food-testing officer?

385
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,750
Do you know

386
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,150
it's a life-threatening job?

387
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,950
I'd need to test Her Majesty's meals for poison.

388
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,750
I know that.

389
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,980
And yet you still want to do that?

390
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,470
If anything happened to you,

391
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,070
how would Siyue live on her own?

392
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,630
How about this?

393
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,830
I've got several acres of land

394
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,670
in the countryside.

395
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,900
I'll lend them to you.

396
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,150
It should be enough for you two

397
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,870
to make a living.

398
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,150
I want to work for Her Majesty.

399
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,470
Her Majesty wouldn't even notice you

400
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,950
even if you died for her.

401
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,190
I will think of a way to make her notice me.

402
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,750
Have you thought it through?

403
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,030
How old are you?

404
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,110
15.

405
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,110
Do you know that food-testing officers
need to retire at 17?

406
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,070
It's enough.

407
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,750
Okay.

408
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,150
From now on,

409
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,030
I will see you as my brother.

410
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,190
If you were lucky enough

411
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,310
to make it,

412
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,430
do not forget that it was me

413
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,470
that helped you.

414
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,310
Thank you, cousin.

415
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,070
I only had two years.

416
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,230
In two years,

417
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,180
I'd become 17, and too old

418
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,550
to work as a food-testing officer.

419
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,190
In two years,

420
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,790
we'd all die.

421
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,510
I had no other option

422
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,070
but

423
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,790
to take some desperate measures.

424
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,390
In the last month before I was 17,

425
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,070
I swallowed arsenic.

426
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,670
Thank god that

427
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,590
I survived.

428
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,470
After that,

429
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,670
Her Majesty noticed me

430
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,030
and began to trust me.

431
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,550
No.

432
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,710
Why would we die

433
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,430
if you didn't work as a food-testing officer?

434
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,150
It doesn't make sense.

435
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,550
We weren't left with no other option.

436
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,910
We could've endured hardships

437
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,310
and lived an ordinary life.

438
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,670
We had a choice.

439
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,950
But why did you still...

440
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,870
What's the difference

441
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,830
between living a mediocre life and death?

442
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,190
So, this is the ultimate truth, right?

443
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,990
All the things you just said

444
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,870
are just excuses.

445
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,990
They're lies!

446
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,550
You can't stand a mediocre life.

447
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,630
So, you were even willing to impede your health

448
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,150
to fulfill your ambition.

449
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,790
You don't understand me.

450
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,190
You don't get to question me.

451
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,030
After I made that move,

452
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,830
the King of Jin began to back us.

453
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,780
No one dared

454
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,070
bully us ever again.

455
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,830
I took over the Interior Guard Services,

456
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,790
and you

457
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,830
could stay alive

458
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,860
and be treated by Her Majesty
 as her own granddaughter.

459
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,550
I've lived to the expectations of our parents.

460
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,180
[Spiritual tablets of Wu Siyue and Wu Youjue's parents]

461
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,990
So,

462
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,910
it was all part of your plan

463
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,710
from the moment

464
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,550
you became the food-testing officer.

465
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,390
Yes.

466
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,630
What about Li Beiqi?

467
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,110
Was he merely

468
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,270
part of your plan?

469
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,590
I have to ask someone else

470
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,790
to investigate Li Beiqi.

471
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,230
I want to investigate all the interior guards

472
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,470
even if it wasn't for Li Beiqi's sake.

473
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,630
Li Beiqi has only gone missing for a day.

474
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,060
How is he a suspect now?

475
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,900
It's because

476
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,190
he's the closest to us.

477
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,710
Beiqi?

478
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,510
Beiqi sacrificed his life

479
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,430
for you and me.

480
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,430
I owe him.

481
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,230
Sir, you asked for me?

482
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,510
Have a seat.

483
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,190
Well...

484
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:07,950
Sit.

485
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,230
Yes, sir.

486
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,900
I have

487
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,510
an important task.

488
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,070
Only you can do it.

489
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,670
I'll be at your service, sir.

490
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,430
During the Ceremony of Light,

491
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,670
all eyes will be

492
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,990
on the Heavenly Temple.

493
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,670
During that time,

494
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,070
there will be 17 refugees

495
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,230
entering Luoyang.

496
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,750
If anyone stops them,

497
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,310
you need to cover up for them

498
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,350
and make sure they can get in.

499
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,590
Their names

500
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,230
are on the license.

501
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,350
I've put my seal on it.

502
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,670
But as the Ceremony is approaching,

503
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,110
refugees are banned to enter Luoyang.

504
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,230
I think it'll be tricky.

505
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,670
Sir,

506
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,190
are the refugees here

507
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,270
for important matters?

508
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,390
They will go to Hanjia Granary.

509
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,070
They'll place the Thunder

510
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,270
at the Granary

511
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,550
and set it off when the time comes.

512
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,070
By then,

513
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,470
everything will be blown up

514
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,710
and set on fire.

515
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,590
Hanjia Granary will be burned down.

516
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,750
Those 17 refugees

517
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,310
will also perish.

518
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,430
Sir, what are you up to?

519
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,070
Are you from Four Season Clan?

520
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,830
How dare you?

521
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,150
If you have to know,

522
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,870
then I'll tell you.

523
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,070
I am not from Four Season Clan.

524
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,950
The Clan is merely at my service.

525
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,950
All the grain at Hanjia Granary will be damaged.

526
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,550
By then,

527
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,190
the whole capital will be in chaos.

528
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,350
I will take over the Intelligence Services.

529
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,030
The Crown Prince will be punished.

530
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,150
I will become the savior of Luoyang

531
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,430
who destroyed the Clan,

532
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,190
caught Lord of Spring alive,

533
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,750
and found all the grain.

534
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,070
Sir!

535
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,070
Sir, what do you want?

536
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:28,670
You...

537
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,030
Are you going to kill them all

538
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,270
and destroy the Granary?

539
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,710
Do you want to be the emperor?

540
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,190
That can't be it.

541
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,390
Sir, you would never do this.

542
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,350
You'd never do this.

543
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,710
You'd never do this!

544
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,310
Why can't I?

545
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,710
Beiqi,

546
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,550
I raised you.

547
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,230
You've always been loyal to me.

548
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,590
Now, I need you to help me

549
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,670
achieve the greater good.

550
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,790
Will you do it?

551
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,590
I can't.

552
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,590
I don't want to do it! I can't!

553
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,270
Sir,

554
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,780
I can't do it.

555
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,830
Then, you're left with only one option.

556
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,590
Kill me.

557
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,710
You raised me.

558
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,430
I can't kill you.

559
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,030
Sir, don't make me.

560
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,950
Siyue must have no idea of this.

561
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,030
Right, I'll tell Siyue.

562
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,910
We'll report you.

563
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,390
We'll go to the authorities.

564
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,550
We'll report you now!

565
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,030
I've committed treason.

566
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,870
I've committed treason.

567
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,230
All of my family will be killed.

568
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,750
By then,

569
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,390
Siyue will be killed, too.

570
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,310
Whether Siyue lives or dies

571
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,950
is up to you now.

572
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,420
Siyue...

573
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,710
If you don't want to help me,

574
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,350
you have to kill me.

575
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,990
No...

576
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,270
Sir,

577
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,550
don't make me do this.

578
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,110
Beiqi...

579
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,070
He died because of me.

580
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,350
He died because of me.

581
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,630
It was because of me.

582
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,870
There, there, Siyue.

583
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,620
Why did you do that?

584
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,670
Beiqi was like family to us.

585
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,630
Why did you do that to him?

586
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,070
You've been telling me since I was little

587
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,500
that we need to guard the capital.

588
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,180
You taught me that!

589
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,550
However, why have you

590
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,670
become like this?

591
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,700
Why have you become like this?

592
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,750
Why?

593
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,670
Siyue,

594
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,110
can't you see it?

595
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,990
I did teach you all that.

596
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,350
But now?

597
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,550
We're living in a different world now!

598
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,750
All of those officials are corrupt.

599
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,030
Everyone's life

600
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,790
is in her hands!

601
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,430
Is that why you want to rebel

602
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,390
and betray Her Majesty?

603
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,430
She's not virtuous enough to rule the country.

604
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,430
Why can't I replace her?

605
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,630
That's not it.

606
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,710
It's not that Her Majesty is not virtuous enough.

607
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,310
It's not that the world has changed.

608
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,910
It's still the same world

609
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,510
as the one we lived in

610
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,310
when you taught me all those things.

611
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,710
It's you that's changed.

612
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,990
You are not the same person

613
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,830
who'd endure anything

614
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,590
to survive.

615
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,390
To achieve your goal,

616
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,820
you're willing to do anything,

617
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,150
even sacrifice yourself.

618
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,190
The easiest way for you

619
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,750
to replace Her Majesty

620
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,870
is to force the Crown Prince to abdicate.

621
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,870
You must've taken

622
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,710
Princess Lu, right?

623
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,910
Judging by his personality,

624
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,190
the Crown Prince will compromise for sure.

625
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,150
What a perfect plan!

626
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,550
Yes,

627
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,710
that is my plan.

628
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,990
Tomorrow, we'll see how it goes.

629
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,470
Please,

630
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,390
stop everything!

631
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,510
Stop it while you still can.

632
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,270
It's too late.

633
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,430
Everything is in order.

634
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,750
Tomorrow,

635
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,110
Luoyang will be turned upside down!

636
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,550
I will stop you.

637
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,070
No matter what it takes,

638
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,950
I will stop you.

639
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,430
How will you stop me?

640
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,190
By asking Gao Bingzhu

641
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,270
and Baili Hongyi for help?

642
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,630
Tell you what.

643
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,430
They're all under my watch.

644
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,110
I know everything they're doing.

645
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,390
Don't push me!

646
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,590
Please, do not go down this wrong path!

647
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,230
You're the only family I've got left.

648
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,790
I don't want to lose you.

649
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,110
Please don't make me do this.

650
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,750
Are you going to kill me?

651
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,030
Do it!

652
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,670
Kill me, the only family you have

653
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,830
in this world.

654
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,270
Do it for those who murdered our parents

655
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,590
before their spiritual tablets!

656
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,510
Stop it!

657
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,230
Kill me!

658
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,190
Do it!

659
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,350
Don't make me do this!

660
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,550
Siyue,

661
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,590
what I've done

662
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,389
is not just for the two of us,

663
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,670
but for the whole country.

664
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,430
If you can't kill me,

665
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,950
give me the Peony Token.

a lot of new guards lately.

669
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,590
We're at turbulent times right now.

670
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,990
Sir Wu said earlier that

671
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,110
we'd recruit more guards.

672
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:55,870

Sir,

00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,790
per your order,

694
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,350

Okay.

Sir, you're so cautious.

703
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,110
No wonder Sir Wu

704
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,260
could entrust such an important task to you.

705
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,870
Sir, someone from the Baili Mansion is here.

706
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,630

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,550
They've set up a banquet at Dangyang Tavern

710
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,710
and wanted to invite you over.

711
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,310
Okay.

712
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,950

We can finally enjoy some nice food!

717
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,310
The famine in Luoyang was just over.

718
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,070
The Tavern is empty without much food available.

719
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,190
These dishes are barely good enough
 to be rated 'Satisfactory.'

720
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,470
What's wrong with being empty?

721
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,350
I hate the hustle and bustle of the capital.

722
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,230
If you ask me,

723
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,150
no place is better than the Unwelcome Well.

724
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,390
Back then, my friends

725
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,750
longed for life outside the Well.

726
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,070
I'd scold them for that.

727
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,870
I've been thinking these days.

728
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,550
When will the chaos

729
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,830
of Luoyang

730
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,710
be put to an end?

731
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,510
I used to brag

732
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,950
with my friends in the Well.

733
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,110
I said that once they got married,

734
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,310
I'd invite all the entertainers here

735
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,270
to the Unwelcome Well to liven things up.

736
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,350
I'd ask them to sing the famous

737
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,630
Praise the Heavenly Monument.

738
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,110
The Heavenly Monument in the sun

739
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,190
is more graceful than the fairyland.

740
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,510
It's the most magnificent place in Luoyang

741
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,190
where you'll be mesmerized by peonies.

742
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,430
Exactly.

743
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,630
These two jars of wine

744
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,950
aren't of the best quality.

745
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,070
I bought them on the street.

746
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,150
I'll use them

747
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,030
as a humble parting gift.

748
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,630
It was a last-minute decision

749
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,710
to leave Luoyang.

750
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,230
Hongyi said that we should follow our hearts.

751
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,870
Since we felt like it today,

752
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,230
we might as well leave tonight.

753
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,550
It all happened too fast.

754
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,150
I hope you don't mind that

755
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,030
we invited you on such short notice.

756
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,470
I was going to invite Madam Wu

757
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,140
to join us,

758
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,470
but I didn't see her.

759
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,790
Her Majesty is sending out grain tomorrow.

760
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,590
All the interior guards

761
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,470
are up to their necks.

762
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,550
It's fine.

763
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,470
You can treat us to some nice wine

764
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,750
when you come back.

765
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,430
We may not come back.

766
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,750
The Clan is destroyed.

767
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,230
I've avenged my father's death.

768
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,940
I've got nothing to miss

769
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,670
in Luoyang.

770
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,430
I'll drink to you as a thank you.

771
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,910
For what?

772
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,310
You and Madam Wu helped me

773
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,990
avenge my father's death.

774
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,470
I wasn't doing it to help you.

775
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,830
However, you solved the Lianshan Rhyme

776
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,230
and found the Thunder.

777
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,670
You've helped us a lot.

778
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,470
I don't care about your motive

779
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,100
but the result.

780
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,310
Siyue is the one you should

781
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,020
thank the most.

782
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,830
I was in it to get my own revenge,

783
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,150
but Siyue was risking her life

784
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,150
to protect our capital.

785
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,590
There's a saying in the Interior Guard Services,

786
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,630
'Keep order for Her Majesty

787
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,390
and protect Luoyang.'

788
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,430
It sounds so easy,

789
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,470
but prohibitively difficult to do so.

790
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,510
I wonder when we'll meet again
 after we bid farewell tonight.

791
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,510
Do you remember

792
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,230
where we first met?

793
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,030
Tao's Lamb Soup at the south market.

794
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,750
Good memory.

795
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,270
I still owe you the money for the lamb soup.

796
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,270
Keep it

797
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,630
as something to remember me by.

798
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,580
Back then, when I needed help,

799
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,310
I could come to you,

800
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,270
Siyue,

801
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,630
or Mr. Unsightly of the Unwelcome Well.

802
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,310
Now that you're gone,

803
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,950
I'll have one less friend in Luoyang.

804
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,670
I can't stop worrying about the folks in the Well.

805
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,390
Those high-ups in Luoyang

806
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,030
don't care about their lives.

807
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,470
If not for them, I'd leave Luoyang, too.

808
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,070
Hongyi,

809
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,230
always remember that

810
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,630
you've got friends in Luoyang.

811
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,390
Take care.

812
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,270
Take care.

813
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,230
Take care.
