00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,360
the teamwork of the Divine Capital Team.

189
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,659
Also, it seems that you all have such strong personas.

190
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,010
So can three of you

191
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,380
introduce yourselves again

192
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,960
like how the characters in the drama would?

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Can you? Xuan, maybe you first.

194
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,080
Hello, my name is Huang Xuan.

195
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,380
I play the role of Gao Bingzhu in “Luoyang”.

196
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,190
Wow, I think Xuan’s next line would be

197
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,580
“My sword is fast.”

198
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,909
“Be careful.” Then Yibo...

199
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,610
I only trust my sword.

200
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,830
Hello, I’m Baili Hongyi.

201
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,460
A tough guy who doesn’t say much.

202
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,380
Now the brains, Victoria.

203
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,160
Let’s all get out of the way. She'll punch us.

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,310
She'll punch you, right?

205
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,230
Don’t make fun of me. What’s wrong with you?

206
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,130
I’m Yuehua, the imperial guard.

207
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,980
Wow, you guys are really...

208
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,760
Maybe I’m stading closer to them.

209
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,710
Once the three of them got into their roles,

210
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,910
I can already feel

211
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,530
the murderous intent coming toward me.

212
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,060
Now let’s talk more about your roles.

213
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,160
Let’s ask Xuan first.

214
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,610
What’s so special about

215
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,060
the role of Gao Bingzhu?

216
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,110
Compared to the roles you’ve played in the past,

217
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,710
is there anything different?

218
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,830
I feel that he's burdened

219
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,230
by something heavy.

220
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,830
He’s a very eye-catching character.

221
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,180
He starts out as a person

222
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,260
who has no attachment to the world.

223
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,880
He doesn’t even want to live.

224
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,180
He only wants revenge.

225
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,130
In the end, after he meets

226
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,630
his two partners

227
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,060
and after all the things that happened to him,

228
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,360
his heart softens.

229
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,180
He starts to realize there is still something to live for.

230
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,760
And so he can finally

231
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,830
grow from a cold-blooded avenger

232
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,080
to a person who wants only to protect

233
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,060
the Divine Capital.

234
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,660
So it’s a character that I think has a lot of changes

235
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,260
and experiences a lot.

236
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,960
OK then, if you think that Gao Bingzhu

237
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,830
is change and richness for Huang Xuan.

238
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,310
Then I would like to ask Yibo.

239
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,180
If you could use one adjective

240
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,330
to describe the character Baili Hongyi,

241
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,530
how would you summarize it?

242
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,310
I think he’s a technical man.

243
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,030
He’s very serious about

244
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,980
what he likes.

245
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,880
And I think he has his own

246
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,809
3D mind about terrains.

247
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,860
Very smart.

248
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,960
A technical man with a 3D mind in ancient times.

249
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,260
Let’s also look forward to Erlang.

250
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,280
Victoria, I have a question for you.

251
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,679
As the only girl

252
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,610
in the Divine Capital Team,

253
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,030
you seem to have quite a different

254
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,480
presence or role.

255
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,730
What kind of role does she play?

256
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,680
She is a kind of the “guardian”, I guess.

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
Basically, she is either saving someone

258
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,060
or on the way to save someone.

259
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,380
Yes, and I think she is someone with a big heart.

260
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,780
She is a person who wants to protect the divine capital.

261
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,380
But at the same time, she also

262
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,530
received a lot of love from other people.

263
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,660
Her brother.

264
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,730
Many other people

265
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,630
also loves Wu Siyue.

266
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,530
So she is saving others

267
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,210
and is also warmed by the love from everyone.

268
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,880
In fact, Victoria mentioned just now

269
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,810
she’s either saving someone

270
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,760
or on the way to save someone.

271
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,710
In the trailer, it seems that Xuan and Victoria

272
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,160
both have quite a lot of fight scenes.

273
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,430
Xuan, now that you look back at

274
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,610
the many fight scenes.

275
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,630
Which one impresses you the most?

276
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,730
People who have watched the trailer should remember,

277
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,880
there is a fight scene in the opening scene in the carriage.

278
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,580
It’s a rather small space.

279
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,380
When I was shooting, I was thinking

280
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,680
how so I present the fight in a small carriage

281
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,110
for such a grand fight scene.

282
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,680
But I think in the end

283
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,560
it was quite spectacular. The scene was shot in two parts.

284
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,680
Three days for each part, and a total of six days was used to shoot that scene.

285
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,030
That one really impressed me.

286
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,080
Another scene was when Wu Siyue came after me

287
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,280
in Buliangjing.

288
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,030
We had a lot of parkouring.

289
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,110
I think that was very exciting.

290
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,980
Because I think it not only

291
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,530
made the best use of space,

292
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,430
but also there were shots in the water, on land, and in the air.

293
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,360
It was an action packed scene.

294
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,130
So it was a very special fight scene.

295
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,060
Very special.

296
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,280
Victoria is a veteran dancer.

297
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,010
Which one do you think is harder?

298
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,530
Martial arts or dancing?

299
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,730
Both of them are hard, but with different levels of difficulty.

300
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,160
I’m glad I studied dance

301
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,910
so it helped me

302
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,730
when I was doing the fight scenes.

303
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,580
Yeah.

304
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,110
Okay.

305
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,160
Then, were there any fight scenes

306
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,380
that left a deep impression on you?

307
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,560
The opening scene I think, the first scene.

308
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
I can’t say it’s the first scene.

309
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,910
It’s the first fight scene.

310
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,310
It was in the South City.

311
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,130
It was a mix of chase scenes and fight scenes.

312
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,680
I think the whole thing was suppose to be one week.

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,030
But I had to shoot 4 to 5 days

314
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,810
for my part.

315
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,810
4 to 5 days.

316
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,930
Yes. That fight scene was packed with choreography.

317
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,680
Running and chasing, it’s very interesting.

318
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,060
And then there was a fight scene in the bamboo forest.

319
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,980
In the bamboo forest?

320
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,630
Yes, the fight scene in the bamboo forest.

321
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,380
It was snowing outside that day.

322
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,960
I remember it was snowing heavily

323
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,880
and it was a dense bamboo forest.

324
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,830
And the leaves of the bamboo blocked the snow from the outside.

325
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,180
So imagine it was snowing outside.

326
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,010
And then we were doing a chase scene and a fight scene

327
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,630
in the bamboo forest.

328
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,260
The fight scene was very enjoyable.

329
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,130
I see.

330
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,410
I believe that when it goes on air,

331
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,960
everyone will also enjoy it too.

332
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
That part was hard for Victoria.

333
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
Her leg was injured during that shoot.

334
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,130
Injured?

335
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,070
She tore her ligaments. It was not easy for her.

336
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,830
But she insisted on completing the fight scene.

337
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,460
But we just watched

338
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,610
the very exciting trailer just now.

339
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,010
I’m sure you feel it’s worth it.

340
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,360
I hope the audience likes it too.

341
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,580
Just now you two talked a lot about the fight scenes

342
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,660
because you two were the brawns in the drama.

343
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,160
Then our Erlang, Baili Hongyi,

344
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,460
should be the brains in the team.

345
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,830
It seems that you have many

346
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,810
witty moments in the drama.

347
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,430
And one of the pictures,

348
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,210
one of the pictures taken on set was trending online.

349
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,010
Let’s take a look at this photo, shall we?

350
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,580
Yibo, look at this photo.

351
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,760
Have you seen this photo?

352
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,410
Yes.

353
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,810
At that time, many netizens were discussing

354
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,910
what Wang Yibo was holding?

355
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,830
It also became a trending topic.

356
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,280
People even made different PS versions.

357
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,010
Have you seen it?

358
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,010
Did any of the photoshopped pictures leave an impression on you?

359
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,130
I have seen one or two.

360
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,660
Can you remember anyone of them?

361
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,960
I’ve seen the one with a big spoon,

362
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,930
saying that I want to drink a bowl of your soup.

363
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,030
Only one spoonful.

364
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,860
Just one big spoon, right?

365
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,460
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,150
Okay.

367
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,180
Now could you

368
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,460
tell us what it is?

369
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,730
What’s in your hand?

370
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,930
This is actually a

371
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,530
tea set for making tea at home.

372
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,080
Yes, he usually drink tea.

373
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,410
Because he likes to eat a lot.

374
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,810
He likes to taste food.

375
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,630
So it's a tool to make tea.

376
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,010
Okay, speaking of which,

377
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,880
Yibo said that his character likes to taste food.

378
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,930
We can give a little bit of a spoiler here.

379
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,050
In the drama, Yibo is

380
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,860
a very, very professional gourmet.

381
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,930
So you guys can go online to see

382
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,310
is there a part that you guys agree with.

383
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,780
Okay.

384
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,680
I want to ask a question for all three of you.

385
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,110
If we look beyond the drama now,

386
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,360
are there any characteristics in these three characters

387
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,230
that you want to keep?

388
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,410
Or is there anything in each other’s characters

389
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,580
that you want to have?

390
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,410
Xuan, do you have any?

391
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,680
His impressive martial arts skill, I guess.

392
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,760
His martial arts skill.

393
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,780
Later on, Gao Bingzhu

394
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,110
does become a person that's full of love and righteousness.

395
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,860
OK.

396
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,030
Anything from the other two characters?

397
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,260
In their characters.

398
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,150
Probably his character's ability to focus.

399
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,450
I think it’s very good.

400
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,490
Baili Hongyi’s ability to focus.

401
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,080
And Wu Siyue’s sense of responsibility.

402
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,210
For Xuan's character,

403
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,480
it's the freedome in his heart.

404
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
His character is like,

405
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,650
no one else can put restraint on him or something like that.

406
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,070
As for Baili Hongyi, I think it’s his ability to focus too.

407
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,980
The fact that he focuses on his research.

408
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,710
Okay.

409
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,560
Then what does Victoria want to keep?

410
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,330
I want to keep the love that Wu Siyue

411
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,830
receive from the people around her.

412
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,280
Yes.

413
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,530
Because I want to have a big brother.

414
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,380
Want to have a brother.

415
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,810
Because in the drama, Wu Siyue’s brother

416
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,330
really treats her very well.

417
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,380
Yes, I want to have a brother.

418
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
And then.

419
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,010
Gao Bingzhu.

420
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,830
I want his kind of persistence.

421
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,980
I must do it, I must find out.

422
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,030
Must achieve the purpose, that kind of persistence.

423
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,960
And then,

424
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,310
Baili Hongyi, I want his kind of intelligence.

425
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,360
Brains.

426
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,530
Yes, he has the smarts.

427
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,410
When he reads a book...

428
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,480
Okay.

429
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,110
He knows everything.

430
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,280
I look forward to seeing

431
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,130
what kind of interaction

432
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,280
the brains, devotion, persistence and

433
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
being loved by a big brother are like after the drama goes on air.

434
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,860
Having said all that, I feel

435
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,030
the team members have very good teamwork.

436
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,460
But it has to be proven.

437
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,910
Let’s test it on the spot.

438
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,130
So let’s have the staff bring on the props.

439
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,560
Let’s do a test of their teamwork.

440
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,640
Okay, everyone, we’re going to

441
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,260
test the teamwork of the Divine Capital Team.

442
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,480
These are the rules. I will ask questions in turn.

443
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,810
The three of you cannot discuss

444
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,060
nor have eye-to-eye communication.

445
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,730
Raise to say who you think fits the answer.

446
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,910
Okay?

447
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,960
If you guys get it right, there is a reward.

448
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,460
If you don’t have teamwork, then there are penalties.

449
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,430
So you must be alerted.

450
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,910
Let's start off with the first question testing their teamwork.

451
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,160
Among the three of you,

452
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,830
who is the person that breaks character the most on set?

453
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,510
321, please put up your answer.

454
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,330
Yes.

455
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,130
Oh!

456
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,130
Why are you changing?

457
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,980
No, no, no.

458
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,210
I want to point to him.

459
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,960
Unanimously point to Xuan, right?

460
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,660
Good.

461
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,710
Who is the person that breaks character the second most on set?

462
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,330
321, please raise your board.

463
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,780
Oh, I...

464
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,780
I saw them discussing with each other.

465
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,510
This can’t be counted.

466
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,560
We didn’t do any discussion.

467
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,610
This can’t be counted.

468
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,110
No.

469
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,740
Really?

470
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,530
Well.

471
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,110
It’s not so necessary to ask this question now.

472
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,460
But I still want to ask,

473
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,170
who breaks character the least?

474
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,130
321, please raise your board.

475
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,060
There are only three of us.

476
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,580
It’s only me left.

477
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,430
See if it will cause the mess.

478
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,060
How about this?

479
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,680
You guys seem to know each other very well.

480
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,120
But I think we need to

481
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,110
prove it with a video.

482
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,910
That’s why I just said

483
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,230
there’s a reward for a right answer and a penalty for a wrong answer.

484
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,130
Anyway, in the end we're playing the outtakes

485
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,130
for everyone's enjoyment.

486
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,780
Okay?

487
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,060
Actually, we’re tied for first place.

488
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,860
Tied for first?

489
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No.

492
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,080
But the trigger is always Xuan.

493
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,260
Yibo said the two of you would start laughing when you look at each other, right?

494
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,310
At the beginning it maybe happened once or twice.

495
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,230
Later on, we laughed whenever we looked at each other.

496
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,580
Okay, let’s take a look at

497

I wonder if they feel the same way.

738
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,710
Okay, let’s take a look at

739
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,880
the next question.

740
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,560
Who among the three of you

741
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,280
is the best worker on set?

742
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,560
321, please raise your boards.

743
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,660
Don’t look at each other.

744
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Worker?

745
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,860
The best worker.

746
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,060
What does it mean?

747
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,730
Worked really hard

748
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,180
on sets.

749
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, a worker.

750
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,830
They work hard and have many skills.

751
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,460
Well.

752
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,160
We’re all...

753
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,260
We’re all quite versatile.

754
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,980
Let’s not raise the boards this round.

755
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,560
This time it's Xuan's.

756
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,060
Xuan’s outtake, okay?

757
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,960
Why do we say

758
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,180
Xuan is the “strongest worker”?

759
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,430
You will get it after watching this video.

760
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,580
Let’s look at the big screen.

761
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
Musical actor Huang Xuan’s opera tour in Divine Capital]

762
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,430
I’m screwed.

763
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,560
Oh.

764
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,120
Are you crazy?

765
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
[Crazy]

766
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,280
Are you?

767
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,960
[I can’t understand it, but I’m blown away]

768
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,000
Actually, if it’s true,

769
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,360
make it more surreal.

770
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
In fact, I’d like to add a dance.

771
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,720
What dance?

772
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
Don’t forget I’m a musical actor.

773
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
[Give it a try]

774
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,320
[You’ve finally found the meaning of life]

775
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,920
[Please enjoy the surreal version of “Luoyang”]

776
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,280
[I finally understand]

777
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,920
[Chun Qiu Dao is the scourge]

778
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,480
[No friends]

779
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,080
[No relatives]

780
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,320
[Off-site assistance]

781
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,600
[Where are you, Chun Qiu Dao]

782
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,520
[I must find you]

783
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,880
[If I don’t get rid of you, the scourge]

784
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,360
[What’s the point of me living?]

785
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,600
[I must destroy Chun Qiu Dao]

786
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,640
[Go on]

787
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,400
[Chun Qiu Dao is our common enemy]

788
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Let’s end the show together.

789
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
And then a panoramic view comes.

790
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,240
[Stage director and choreographer]

791
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,840
Everyone.

792
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120
[Singing, dancing and choreographing]

793
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
And then bang.

794
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,240
[SLAY]

795
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,840
[I’ve never shot anything so high before. Applauding like crazy]

796
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,560
[In my eyes, this is the positive]

797
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,830
That's why you're the hardest worker.

798
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,480
You find extra work to do.

799
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,360
Can I understand it like this?

800
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,780
What’s wrong with me?

801
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,160
You find extra work for youself.

802
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
You want to add music and dance too.

803
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,460
So are you the most hardworking person?

804
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,660
No, no.

805
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,980
I think there was a need to

806
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,160
lighten up the atmosphere.

807
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,930
Because Gao Bingzhu was really too bitter.

808
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,510
He looks like he is always troubled.

809
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,810
It’s my instinct to create some fun.

810
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,130
He needed some side work.

811
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,710
Some side work.

812
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,030
What about the two of you?

813
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,860
Did you guys have a side projects on set?

814
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,080
Yibo, did you do anything

815
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,280
that was funny?

816
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,260
For example, when the three of you

817
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,110
were on set?

818
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,110
Xuan might sing and dance.

819
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,080
Do you two have anything

820
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,210
funny you can share with us on the set?

821
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,910
Breaking character seems the funniest, I guess.

822
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,080
Yibo was working out at that time.

823
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,560
Working out.

824
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,680
How about Victoria?

825
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
Did you have something you did?

826
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,730
One of them worked out while the other sing and danced.

827
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,930
Me.

828
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,930
I made clothes for the kitty.

829
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,160
Tailoring.

830
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,060
They are the loving trio. The three of them are pretty funny.

831
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,710
Then our next question is

832
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,610
who was the “craziest” on set?

833
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,960
You’re allowed to have

834
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,080
your own interpretation, okay?

835
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,460
No prior discussion. Now look ahead.

836
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,210
321. Who is the “craziest”, please raise your boards.

837
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,040
The “craziest”.

838
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,920
Then,

839
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,480
Xuan first, tell us what kind of crazy Victoria was.

840
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,160
What kind of crazy? And why is she the craziest?

841
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,180
She kept talking to everything around her.

842
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,980
Talking to herself.

843
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,460
So she seems a little crazy.

844
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
Yibo chose Xuan.

845
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,830
Why?

846
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,460
The video just now tells everything.

847
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,560
It explains everything.

848
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,730
What about Victoria?

849
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,760
He’s hasty.

850
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,580
He’s just very hotheaded in the show.

851
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes, he is always in a hurry.

852
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,460
He comes and goes very quickly.

853
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,180
If there's something to discuss,

854
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,960
he'll rush off before your words are finished.

855
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,360
OK, this is the “crazy” you’re talking about.

856
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,760
In fact, I think

857
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,330
each of you has your own interpretation of “crazy”.

858
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,530
Because we also have a collective footage of

859
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,830
the whole team

860
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,210
to see what kind of “crazy” each person has.

861
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,280
Please watch the outtake.

862
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,720
[I can’t stand to see it]

863
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
I think I take a pile of snot.

864
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
[Hahahahaha]

865
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,000
[Let me explain]

866
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,320
I may haven’t put enough of it just now.

867
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,480
And I made it too sticky.

868
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,400
I feel a little…

869
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,280
[It’s funny]

870
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
[Laughs*2]

871
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,520
[Shutdown]

872
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
[Laughs*3]

873
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
What’s wrong?

874
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
[I’m sorry I couldn’t hold it in]

875
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,160
Come on, stop.

876
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,960
I’m sorry.

877
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,000
[Amusingly aroused]

878
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,280
Action.

879
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
[Laughter*N]

880
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,010
Victoria is holding back so hard.

881
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,330
I tried so hard not to laugh.

882
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,960
Cut.

883
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Director

884
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
[Help me, help me, help me]

885
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,680
is holding back so hard that his face turns red.

886
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,560
[Why is it so funny?]

887
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
[No, I can’t laugh]

888
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,180
Look at the director’s face.

889
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,440
[Hahahaha]

890
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,480
[You guys wake up]

891
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
[I can’t laugh. I can’t laugh.]

892
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,480
[Fairies don’t laugh]

893
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,280
[What is never expected is ......]

894
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,600
I heard

895
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
you’re very good at the art of alchemy.

896
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,840
[Start laughing]

897
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,520
[Want to laugh]

898
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,040
[You hold back]

899
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,600
[Can’t help it]

900
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,880
[What’s wrong with you? Who am I? Where am I?]

901
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,160
[I can’t help myself]

902
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,630
You really couldn't help yourself.

903
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,080
[Completely abandon]

904
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,320
Stop for a moment.

905
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,640
Why?

906
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,440
[I want to be quiet]

907
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,840
I’m not looking at him.

908
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,680
Come on.

909
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,680
Shoot it.

910
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,120
[I can do it. I can do it.]

911
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
Three, two, one, action.

912
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,400
[Here’s a perfect shot]

913
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,040
Cut.

914
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,440
[Be careful with the jokes today]

915
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
[Today it’s easy to get a laugh]

916
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,080
[Hahahahahahahaha]

917
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,360
OK. It seems that you three

918
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,410
have similar humor.

919
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,760
Basically, one person laughs

920
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,160
and the other two people can’t help it.

921
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,210
Yeah.

922
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,530
That’s why I said he was the trigger.

923
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,680
It’s true that Xuan laughed first every time.

924
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,130
Since their humor are so similar

925
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,810
they must be destined to team up.

926
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,580
So about the interpreted “The Divine Capital of Fate”.

927
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,680
Mr. Xu Kang,

928
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,410
do you think their teamwork

929
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,160
and humor

930
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,410
is a good interpretation of

931
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,660
“The Divine Capital of Fate” riddle?

932
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,560
They are so fated.

933
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,780
We were laughing so hard we were crying.

934
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,530
Okay,

935
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,560
our mystery-revealing is completed.

936
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,160
Next, we’ll have the staff

937
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,880
help us hang the puzzle card in Mr. Xu Kang’s hand

938
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,980
on the blessing lantern

939
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,260
and help us light up the first blessing lantern.

940
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,610
Our “The Divine Capital of Fate”.

941
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,630
Okay, our first blessing lantern

942
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,510
has been lit up.

943
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,210
Then it’s time to reveal

944
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,010
our second riddle.

945
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,660
The answer to the second riddle

946
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,380
is in the hands of Ms. Dai Ying.

947
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,480
Ms. Ying Dai,

948
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,680
how do you think this YYDSD can be interpreted?

949
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,230
What kind of divine capital is it?

950
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,910
I really don’t need to think.

951
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,280
I have the answer.

952
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,880
Well, tell us the answer.

953
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,330
But I think we can…

954
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,660
Because Yibo is a native of Luoyang,

955
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,680
we can let Yibo read it in his native dialect.

956
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,910
Yibo, give it a try.

957
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,180
How do I say this?

958
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,660
How do you say it in your hometown dialect?

959
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Elegant Divine Capital.

960
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,010
Elegant Divine Capital.

961
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,170
Almost.

962
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,530
Can you do it again?

963
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,580
Elegant Divine Capital.

964
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,330
Elegant Divine Capital.

965
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,310
Okay, then, Elegant Divine Capital.

966
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,430
We still have to explain it.

967
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,130
Just now we talked about the elegance of the divine capital.

968
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,210
In fact,the peonies in Luoyang,

969
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,230
and everything is elegant.

970
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,360
In this round, we want the three of you

971
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,780
who are all elegant people

972
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,180
with individual elegance in the drama,

973
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,430
to show it to us.

974
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,260
Lets start with Xuan.

975
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,530
I heard that Xuan has practiced

976
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,810
calligraphy, right?

977
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes, I usually write calligraphy.

978
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,910
So today,

979
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,830
can you show us your calligraphy for the lantern ceremony?

980
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,620
Sure.

981
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,130
Okay, Xuan has agreed. Bring the props.

982
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,730
I will grind the ink for you.

983
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,780
Eh, okay.

984
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,260
Yes, let Victoria grind the ink.

985
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,460
Let's see what words Xuan will give us

986
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,360
for the Lantern Burning Ceremony?

987
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,630
Wow, very well written.

988
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,480
Hold up the first word.

989
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,730
Please show us.

990
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,580
Luo.

991
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,159
It’s a “Luo”.

992
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,880
Okay, how many are you writting?

993
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,260
Three, I think.

994
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,010
Okay.

995
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,630
Looking at the three of them like this,

996
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,880
it's as if they are back in the drama.

997
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,960
Nicely done. The second word is

998
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,880
“Divine”.

999
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,659
“Divine”.

1000
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,510
Okay. Let's wait for the third word.

1001
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,659
Victoria takes out the paper

1002
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,230
and then Yibo puts away the finished ones.

1003
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,530
I feel they’re really good at working together.

1004
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,880
I’m really flattered.

1005
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,380
Xuan is satisfied.

1006
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,530
The word “wish” is written in one go.

1007
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,210
Show us.

1008
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,480
“Wish”.

1009
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,730
Each of you, take one

1010
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,210
and show us together. Okay?

1011
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,810
The three words are

1012
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,260
“Luo”, “Divine”, and “Wish”.

1013
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,710
How nice.

1014
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,560
Xuan, tell us

1015
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,860
what you want to express

1016
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,910
with these three words.

1017
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,110
The word “Luo” represents Luoyang.

1018
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,680
It’s the theme of our entire drama.

1019
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,560
And “Divine” stands for the divine capital,

1020
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
the divine capital that we have been guarding.

1021
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,260
That’s “Divine”.

1022
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,830
And then “wish” means

1023
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,710
our wish in the drama to guard the divine capital.

1024
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,760
To guard Luoyang.

1025
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,930
And it also represents my wish.

1026
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,580
I hope more viewers can watch “Luoyang”

1027
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,960
and love “Luoyang”.

1028
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,130
That’s a good point, it’s not only Xuan’s wish

1029
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,110
but also our wish.

1030
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,010
Now let’s have the staff

1031
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,230
help us to put these three words

1032
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,160
away properly.

1033
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,760
Meanwhile, let’s move on to the next segment.

1034
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,160
Okay, everyone, let’s move on to

1035
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,530
our “Elegant Interactive Session”.

1036
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,480
Yibo has a lot of delicacy in front of him.

1037
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,710
But I want to ask Yibo,

1038
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,730
does this thing in my hand look familiar?

1039
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,280
Yes, it does.

1040
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,060
What is it? Tell us about it.

1041
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,780
“Shangke”.

1042
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,360
What does “Shangke” mean?

1043
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,010
It means not bad.

1044
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,110
It means not bad.

1045
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,280
What special meaning does "Shangke"

1046
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,780
have in the drama?

1047
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,130
It means if I find dishes

1048
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,780
in a restaurant is not bad,

1049
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,980
I’ll give it a "Shangke".

1050
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,380
So your "Shangke" in the drama

1051
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,560
is a very significant "Shangke".

1052
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,280
Right.

1053
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,880
Okay, so is it true that if a business has

1054
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,430
your “Shangke”, they would become proud?

1055
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,980
I guess so.

1056
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,680
Okay, then.

1057
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,110
Now there are 12 kinds of Luoyang food in front of you.

1058
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,930
Yibo, could you mark the three foods you like

1059
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,630
with “Shangke”, okay?

1060
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,360
The three you like the most.

1061
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,530
Can Yibo introduce them to us?

1062
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,580
I think I’ve only eaten eight treasure rice out of these three.

1063
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,880
I’ve never heard of the other two.

1064
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,830
Could you introduce them?

1065
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:10,730
The Pasty Noodles have a sour taste. Yeah.

1066
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,460
Though it’s considered a noodle dish,

1067
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,230
it’s eaten with a spoon.

1068
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,210
Yes, it’s thick.

1069
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,210
It's stewed for a long time.

1070
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,430
Yes.

1071
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,460
It’s mushy.

1072
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,260
Anyway, it’s delicious.

1073
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,780
It's even better with some crunchy stuff.

1074
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,530
Various condiments.

1075
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,630
The eight treasure rice is sweet, right?

1076
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,230
Yes, it’s sweet. I ate it when I was a kid.

1077
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,080
And then there’s the water meatballs.

1078
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,510
The meatballs

1079
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,610
must be taken quickly.

1080
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,380
And eat them

1081
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,660
as they gain the crunchy texture.

1082
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,710
It sounds so good. I want to go to

1083
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,860
Luoyang to have a taste.

1084
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,330
Is there any Luoyang food

1085
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,430
that Xuan and Victoria like?

1086
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,930
Their eyes

1087
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,510
are almost on the board.

1088
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,460
I want to eat them all.

1089
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,780
Which one do you want to eat?

1090
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,630
Have a look.

1091
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,230
I want to eat them all.

1092
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,280
But I’ve never seen this.

1093
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,460
What is “braised goods”?

1094
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,880
I do not know.

1095
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,410
It’s a…

1096
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,760
What? It’s like a stewed dish.

1097
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,610
Braised dish, like braised dish.

1098
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,080
The steamed meat is also delicious.

1099
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,960
Delicious.

1100
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,260
Yes, I’ve had steamed meat before.

1101
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,660
I haven’t seen many of them.

1102
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,330
I have never tried them.

1103
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,280
Except for the eight treasure rice.

1104
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,660
Yibo, why don’t you recommend

1105
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,880
one each for Xuan and Victoria, okay?

1106
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,180
I think Xuan can have the steamed meat.

1107
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,460
To go with liquor.

1108
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,060
Yes, to go with liquor, and for Victoria…

1109
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,630
Recommend them all to me, give them all to me.

1110
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,710
I think you’ll like the eight treasure rice.

1111
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,610
Because it’s a sweet dish.

1112
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,260
Okay, we hope

1113
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,010
we can go to Luoyang to have a taste

1114
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,010
of these delicacies.

1115
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,380
Okay, let's move on.

1116
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,930
Yibo’s food review

1117
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,830
ends here.

1118
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,780
Let's move on to the

1119
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,710
elegant interactive segment.

1120
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,580
This part has to do with Victoria’s beautiful

1121
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,260
makeup.

1122
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,450
Please bring on the props.

1123
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,460
Okay, everyone.

1124
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,280
Now we’ll move on to Victoria’s

1125
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,680
elegant interactive segment.

1126
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,260
I heard that the women in the divine capital

1127
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,030
all look good in makeup.

1128
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,580
And their makeup

1129
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,030
vary a lot.

1130
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,710
Every single piece, such as the "Huadian" makeup.

1131
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,810
Even though it's a minor detail,

1132
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,810
there are many different ways of drawing it.

1133
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,980
So today, Victoria, could you show us

1134
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,180
the 4 different "Huadian" makeups?

1135
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:12,910
Okay.

1136
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,710
Draw them first and not show the audience.

1137
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,710
When it’s done, turn around.

1138
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,130
I’m starting.

1139
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,230
Victoria is rolling up her sleeves.

1140
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,630
Six eyes on the stage staring at one hand.

1141
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,780
Wow, this is beautiful!

1142
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,960
This is like a logo printed on it.

1143
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,330
We are now finishing the third one.

1144
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,380
We will show all of it to everyone later.

1145
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,910
Victoria is very serious about her drawing.

1146
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,280
She seems to have entered

1147
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
the world of "Huadian" makeup.

1148
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,080
It’s so beautiful, okay.

1149
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,830
I'll leave it as is.

1150
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,830
It’s perfect. Put it up like this.

1151
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,630
Then we’ll turn them around.

1152
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:52,460
Let's show it to everyone. Okay.

1153
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,080
Here we are.

1154
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,430
Let’s give a round of applause first, okay?

1155
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,310
Victoria, could you tell us

1156
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,710
what kind of design is in each of them?

1157
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,410
I actually drew the first one in the drama.

1158
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,710
It’s similar.

1159
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,080
So is the second one.

1160
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,630
I drew a similar one in the drama.

1161
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,860
Like bunny ears.

1162
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,930
And this one I remember,

1163
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,610
Miss Liu wore a similar one.

1164
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,580
This looks like maple leaves.

1165
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,230
Yes, it is a relatively simple.

1166
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,880
And this is my random drawing.

1167
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I drew it randomly.

1168
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,560
I think this looks well designed.

1169
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,210
I’ve seen it before.

1170
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,680
But I don’t remember clearly.

1171
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,880
I’m not sure what it looked like.

1172
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,260
But it seems to be something like…

1173
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,180
This is what it looks like.

1174
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,060
In your mind, but after it’s done,

1175
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,560
I said to Xuan that it looks like

1176
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,680
it’s printed. It’s all one.

1177
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,960
It’s very textured.

1178
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,080
Victoria, choose one

1179
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,160
you like the most, okay?

1180
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,310
Then I'll choose

1181
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,370
the one I had previously.

1182
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,220
Let's hear from Xuan.

1183
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,390
Which one do you think is the cutest?

1184
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,920
What do you think of her painting skills?

1185
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,730
I really

1186
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,000
prefer the one

1187
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,450
on the side.

1188
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,600
It's simple

1189
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,330
and mysterious.

1190
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,390
Its curves are very special.

1191
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,840
Yibo, what about you?

1192
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,460
In fact, I also prefer this one.

1193
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,820
Because when she drew the first two strokes,

1194
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,270
I thought it was a question mark,

1195
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,120
and then she added the last stroke.

1196
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,160
So it looks like that.

1197
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,160
It's very different.

1198
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,270
I think these four are great.

1199
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,020
I hope that

1200
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,410
the "Huadian" makeup

1201
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,800
of our actresses

1202
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,830
in the drama

1203
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,130
is loved by everyone.

1204
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,310
OK. Next,

1205
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,510
let's hear from Ms. Dai Ying.

1206
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,510
What do you think of

1207
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,010
our introduction to "Elegant Luoyang"

1208
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,790
in this segment?

1209
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,100
Did they qualify?

1210
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,980
Perfect.

1211
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,170
Perfect. OK.

1212
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,410
We can light up

1213
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,920
the second blessing lantern.

1214
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,780
Someone please get

1215
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,020
the token of "Elegant Luoyang"

1216
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,640
from Ms. Dai Ying's hand

1217
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,800
and helps us

1218
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,740
light up

1219
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,900
the blessing lantern.

1220
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,580
OK.

1221
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,950
The blessing lantern has been lit.

1222
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,100
Ms. Dai Ying is also satisfied with

1223
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,300
"Elegant Luoyang".

1224
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,900
Let's go on

1225
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,950
announcing

1226
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,880
the third answer.

1227
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,860
Let's ask

1228
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,040
Mr. Ma Boyong.

1229
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,980
What's the answer?

1230
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,170
The answer is "Dazzling Luoyang".

1231
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,590
"Dazzling Luoyang".

1232
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,030
You three are going to show

1233
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,700
how dazzling you are.

1234
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,330
How about displaying

1235
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,370
your dazzling skills?

1236
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,160
To be honest,

1237
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,880
the three characters in the drama are dazzling.

1238
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,230
You three are also very dazzling.

1239
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,840
Let's show it

1240
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,610
here.

1241
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,920
In my opinion,

1242
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,450
the acting skills of Xuan are really dazzling.

1243
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,970
Because the role of Gao Bingzhu

1244
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,980
from…

1245
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,050
Is this a spoiler?

1246
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,230
I will give a little bit away.

1247
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,900
He changed

1248
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,530
his identity from a Buliang's Official

1249
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,210
to other ones.

1250
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,060
Therefore, his state of mind

1251
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,520
were always changing.

1252
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,440
I think

1253
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,930
his lines we watched in the trailer just now

1254
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,110
were also amazing.

1255
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,910
So let's have Xuan

1256
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,440
show us

1257
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,740
his lines

1258
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,090
in different states.

1259
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,560
Do you accept the challenge?

1260
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,090
OK. Come on.

1261
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,650
Let's go.

1262
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,910
Show the lines to Xuan.

1263
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,390
Show us

1264
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,170
the original version of those lines first, OK?

1265
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,900
The normal version of Gao Bingzhu.

1266
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,250
All I want is revenge.

1267
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,860
But I'm like

1268
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,940
a lonely ghost.

1269
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,640
I don't even believe in my shadow.

1270
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,050
I only believe in my sword.

1271
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,490
Do you feel

1272
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,700
goosebumps all over?

1273
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,190
I only believe in my sword.

1274
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,120
Okay.

1275
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,030
The next one would test

1276
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,310
his dazzling skills.

1277
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,640
We want a version in Henan dialect.

1278
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,170
Xuan.

1279
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,180
I'll read the lines in the way I feel.

1280
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,010
OK. OK.

1281
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,870
Yibo, help me out later.

1282
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,330
All I want is revenge.

1283
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,810
But I'm like

1284
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,950
a lonely ghost.

1285
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,650
I don't even believe in my shadow.

1286
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,910
I only believe in my sword.

1287
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,620
I only believe in my sword.

1288
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,410
Yibo, what do you think of it?

1289
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,360
OK. OK.

1290
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,060
Give it a score.

1291
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,320
Can he get more than 80 points?

1292
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,210
It's about my level.

1293
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,400
That's perfect.

1294
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,550
It's about my level.

1295
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,640
OK. The second version

1296
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,330
should be tender and sweet.

1297
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,550
-A soulful one?
-Yes.

1298
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,840
If need be,

1299
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,620
you can ask someone

1300
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,690
to act with you.

1301
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,590
I will read them myself.

1302
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,360
OK. Tender and sweet version.

1303
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,950
All I want is revenge.

1304
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,200
But I'm like

1305
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,390
a lonely ghost.

1306
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,930
I don't even believe in my shadow.

1307
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,260
I only believe in my sword.

1308
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,470
I'm so touched.

1309
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,670
Xuan can really

1310
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,040
change the mood of the whole place

1311
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,570
in about 20 seconds.

1312
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,490
It's nothing.

1313
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,610
The music changed.

1314
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,850
What style

1315
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,490
do you want in the third version?

1316
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,860
The keyboardist will try to keep up with you.

1317
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,410
Pick something you want to try.

1318
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,700
Whatever you like.

1319
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,800
Oh, ladies and gentlemen.

1320
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,110
All I want is revenge.

1321
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,470
But I'm like

1322
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,980
a lonely ghost.

1323
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,010
I don't even believe in my shadow.

1324
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,710
I only believe in my sword.

1325
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,180
Oh, that's wonderful.

1326
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,330
The dubbed film version is also great.

1327
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,780
So is this part

1328
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,500
dazzling?

1329
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,940
This part

1330
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,210
is so dazzling.

1331
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,260
Next up

1332
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,660
the dazzling part of Yibo.

1333
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,490
In this part,

1334
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,350
Yibo needs to show his hands-on skills.

1335
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,930
Fetch some props over here.

1336
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,700
These are

1337
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,540
Lu Ban Locks.

1338
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,310
Baili Hongyi

1339
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,190
in the drama

1340
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,530
was very good with his hands.

1341
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,180
Yibo,

1342
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,580
why don't you choose one

1343
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,430
to challenge?

1344
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,210
Open and close it in five minutes.

1345
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,050
Oh, OK. I'll choose this simple one.

1346
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,170
All right, let's start the clock.

1347
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,270
All right, here we go.

1348
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,950
Wow.

1349
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,160
Unlock it in one second.

1350
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,420
As long as

1351
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,920
one of them is unlocked,

1352
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,620
the rest will be scattered.

1353
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,800
You still have to put it together.

1354
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,650
This is actually hard.

1355
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,060
It's like walking a maze.

1356
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,750
You have to explore its pattern

1357
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,900
step by step.

1358
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,310
I seem to know

1359
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,480
how to unlock this.

1360
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,990
I can only dismantle it.

1361
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,900
Leave it to Yibo later.

1362
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,980
Wow, it's done.

1363
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,040
Look at the time.

1364
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,990
1 minutes and 20 seconds.

1365
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,290
Wow.

1366
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,830
It only took you a minute and 20 seconds, Yibo.

1367
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,110
This is simple, so it didn't take much time.

1368
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,870
How about this?

1369
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,480
Will you take these two apart

1370
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,380
for us?

1371
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,270
Why don't you put together the one

1372
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,310
I took apart.

1373
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,570
I think this one is a little too difficult.

1374
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,460
I think it's very interesting for him

1375
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,410
to play with this.

1376
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,760
It's a nightmare for me,

1377
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,840
as I'm not good at geometry.

1378
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,360
Each solution is different.

1379
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,040
Oh, it is unlocked.

1380
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,510
How long was that?

1381
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,290
He solved it in 15 seconds.

1382
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,350
Great.

1383
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,210
OK, let's have a round of applause for Yibo.

1384
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,420
This part is indeed amazing.

1385
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,300
His hands-on skills are dazzling.

1386
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,460
This part is finished.

1387
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,470
Next, let's check

1388
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,660
the content of

1389
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,310
Victoria's dazzling part.

1390
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,650
Next it is the time for Victoria

1391
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,660
to show her dazzling skills.

1392
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,320
In this part,

1393
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,510
Victoria should show us her skills in both brainy and brawny activities,

1394
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,320
because Wu Siyue is a role

1395
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
good at both brainy and brawny activities in the drama.

1396
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,060
For the brainy activity,

1397
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,440
you can teach us some etiquette.

1398
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,470
Etiquette?

1399
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,630
I have heard of

1400
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,920
something called fingers crossing salute.

1401
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,240
Please show it to us.

1402
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,270
Just cross your fingers like this.

1403
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,020
Right.

1404
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,050
This is the gesture

1405
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,280
of the Joint Corps.

1406
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,720
What is the Joint Corps?

1407
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,240
They are a mysterious organization

1408
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,700
in the show.

1409
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,100
They know everything and can do everything.

1410
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,420
They know everything and can do everything.

1411
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,820
So Wu Siyue was a female official

1412
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,590
as skillful as their male peers in Luoyang,

1413
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,100
right?

1414
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,590
Yes.

1415
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,400
When I investigated the cases,

1416
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,650
the Joint Corps actually helped me a lot.

1417
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,350
OK. This is a fingers crossing salute.

1418
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,710
There is a hands crossing salute.

1419
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,920
There is a distinction between males and females.

1420
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,190
Teach us the gesture for girls.

1421
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,260
Girls put their right hand outside

1422
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,990
and cross like this.

1423
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,580
First, hold up the thumb

1424
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,510
like this

1425
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,630
and hold it.

1426
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,310
The little finger comes out naturally.

1427
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,320
Cross like this.

1428
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,310
Put it…

1429
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,370
Normally, girls do this gesture

1430
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,990
on their chests,

1431
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,110
but in the TV play, I was…

1432
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,100
What should I say? I was…

1433
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,010
You were a female official

1434
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,940
as excellent as your male peers.

1435
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,660
I was an inner guard,

1436
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,430
so I usually kept

1437
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,870
the same distance as boys.

1438
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,330
A little away.

1439
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,650
I can't show the gesture of boys.

1440
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,320
Their left hands are outside.

1441
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,830
Male left

1442
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,590
and female right.

1443
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,150
Yes.

1444
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,650
My gesture was like this.

1445
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,550
When would you

1446
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,000
use this gesture?

1447
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,900
When you met

1448
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:08,730
or when you said goodbye?

1449
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,650
It works

1450
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,730
in both cases.

1451
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,550
It's a bit like

1452
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,760
saying hello now.

1453
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,590
Yes.

1454
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,920
Would you like to

1455
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,270
greet us in the way

1456
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,470
you make a hands crossing salute

1457
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,230
in the drama?

1458
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,750
Well, greetings from the Capital Team.

1459
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,530
Wow, I felt

1460
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,610
the cultural charm.

1461
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,810
Well, that’s the end of the culture part.

1462
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,340
Now let’s move on to the martial part.

1463
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,340
In the trailer we watched just now,

1464
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,730
there is a scene that you fight in the bamboo forest.

1465
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,200
And we talked about it just now.

1466
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,530
It’s pretty cool.

1467
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,700
So, would you like to

1468
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,840
show us

1469
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,370
several cool fighting poses

1470
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,600
while we play some background music?

1471
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,810
Is that okay?

1472
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,130
In fact,

1473
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,400
as the director said,

1474
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,010
as long as my sword comes out of its sheath,

1475
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,610
I am going to fight.

1476
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,560
I just fight without words.

1477
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,400
I will not draw my sword for trivial thing.

1478
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,560
Yes. I usually start fighting without talking,

1479
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,690
so I’m afraid you will accidentally get hurt.

1480
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,990
It doesn’t matter. Get the sword and wires ready.

1481
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,390
Okay. Please get the wires ready.

1482
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,430
I will make several poses.

1483
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,170
I use several weapons in the show,

1484
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,140
so I will make several poses

1485
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,530
for the audience to guess.

1486
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,220
OK.

1487
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,250
These several poses are for different weapons.

1488
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,240
You may find them

1489
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,070
in the show.

1490
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,180
Music, please.

1491
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,720
This is the first one.

1492
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
It looks a bit like a pose for a sword.

1493
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,880
And this is the second one.

1494
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,080
Cool.

1495
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,370
And this is the third one.

1496
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,840
It looks like a pose for a powerful weapon.

1497
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,800
The fourth one is like this.

1498
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,230
This is my most powerful weapon.

1499
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,090
Most powerful weapon.

1500
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,300
I’ll hide it.

1501
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,980
Keep it. Keep it.

1502
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,560
Everyone,

1503
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,500
those four poses

1504
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
are used for four different weapons.

1505
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,150
Watch the show

1506
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,290
to find out what

1507
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,100
these weapons are.

1508
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,630
OK.

1509
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,330
This is Victoria’s show time.

1510
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,010
Now I’d like to ask Mr. Ma Boyong.

1511
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,800
What do you think of their talents?

1512
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,690
Can they solve a riddle?

1513
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,610
Absolutely amazing.

1514
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,880
Okay. Staff member, please

1515
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,240
take the token from Mr. Ma

1516
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,110
to light up the third blessing lantern.

1517
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:33,180
Congratulations to Divine Capital Team

1518
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
for solving the third riddle.

1519
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,340
There is only one unlit lantern.

1520
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,230
We’ll light it up later,

1521
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,920
because we’re going to

1522
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
play a game.

1523
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,120
Several mysterious guests are invited

1524
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,060
to face the last round of challenges.

1525
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,290
Let’s put our hands together for

1526
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,080
chief director Xie Ze,

1527
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,210
chief playwright Wu Cong,

1528
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,210
actor Jiang Long and actress Liu Enjia.

1529
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,280
Welcome.

1530
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,300
Please.

1531
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,760
Please come to the stage.

1532
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,490
You’re shifting the center.

1533
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,490
Come on. Take center stage.

1534
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,630
Yibo, you just stand there. Don’t be too modest.

1535
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,690
We’ll stand beside the director.

1536
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,250
Okay.

1537
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,560
You’re all very modest.

1538
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,440
Okay, welcome the four of you.

1539
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,640
Please say hello to

1540
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,770
your fans.

1541
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,060
Hello,

1542
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,250
I’m Wu Cong,

1543
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,610
one of the playwrights of “Luoyang”.

1544
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,290
Welcome. Welcome playwright Mr. Wu Cong.

1545
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,630
Hello,

1546
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,900
I’m Xie Ze,

1547
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,390
the director of “Luoyang”.

1548
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,470
Welcome, Director Xie.

1549
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,480
Hello, I’m Liu Enjia.

1550
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,550
I play Qing Ye in “Luoyang”.

1551
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,890
Welcome Liu Enjia who plays Qing Ye.

1552
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,460
Jiang Long.

1553
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,310
Hello, I’m Jiang Long.

1554
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,910
I play Bai Lang, Little White Dragon in Waves

1555
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,910
in “Luoyang”.

1556
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,520
Welcome. Welcome, Jiang Long.

1557
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,310
I have several questions for you.

1558
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,510
Director Xie,

1559
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,750
what do you think

1560
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,450
is the biggest challenge

1561
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,150
during the filming of “Luoyang”?

1562
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,350
The biggest challenge?

1563
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,250
Yes.

1564
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,550
We watched the video just now.

1565
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,150
Breaking character, right?

1566
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,450
I saw

1567
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,780
those blurred out words

1568
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,280
are all from me.

1569
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,590
You said something that can’t be aired.

1570
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,010
Did you try any way

1571
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,240
to solve the problem?

1572
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,300
To calm down their laughter

1573
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,150
on set?

1574
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,550
To try to stop them.

1575
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,470
They stopped laughing when they got tired.

1576
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,990
They stopped when they got tired.

1577
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,530
They stopped laughing when they got tired.

1578
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,610
Okay, I have a question for

1579
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,290
playwright Wu Cong.

1580
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:37,860
In the world full of imagination

1581
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,720
in “Luoyang”,

1582
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,870
which point

1583
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,070
or which story attracts you most?

1584
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,010
First, we made some

1585
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,280
imaginative settings.

1586
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,580
For example, Joint Corps

1587
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,120
is a fictional agency.

1588
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,000
And we also set a scene for

1589
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,740
Buliangjing.

1590
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,640
I think the biggest challenge is

1591
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,830
to complete these basic settings.

1592
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,260
And it is something interesting.

1593
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,840
OK. I believe it will

1594
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,720
be interesting to the audience.

1595
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,820
OK. I also have some questions for Enjia.

1596
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,220
Can you tell us about

1597
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,650
the character Qing Ye in the drama?

1598
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,850
I think Qing Ye is quite complicated.

1599
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,860
We can’t just say she is a good character or she is bad character.

1600
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,860
She has quite good martial skills.

1601
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,560
And she helps Gao Bingzhu

1602
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,990
solve some problems.

1603
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,140
She has

1604
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,360
her own difficulties

1605
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,580
that others don’t understand.

1606
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,560
So I don’t want to be a spoiler.

1607
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,610
Hope you can watch it.

1608
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:30,980
So let’s stop talking about the details.

1609
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,920
Can you share with us

1610
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,390
any wonderful or impressive rival show

1611
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,720
you put on with three members

1612
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,920
of Divine Capital Team?

1613
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,950
I think no matter which one I talk about, I will become a spoiler.

1614
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,390
One rival show is a huge challenge for me.

1615
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,000
When I read the script,

1616
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,720
my hands were shaking.

1617
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,670
I just thought it was very difficult.

1618
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,880
And I said to the director that…

1619
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,140
The rival

1620
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,530
is Xuan.

1621
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,860
And it was huge pressure for me.

1622
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,770
They encouraged and guided me with patience.

1623
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,520
In particular, Xuan helped me all the time.

1624
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,110
At last, we completed it very well.

1625
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,890
It’s also a breakthrough for me.

1626
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:05,980
Thank you, Xuan.

1627
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,650
We’re looking forward to it.

1628
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,680
Well, let’s talk with Jiang Long.

1629
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,660
Jiang Long

1630
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,370
often plays as

1631
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,670
an amusing character.

1632
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,150
Is Bai Lang also such a character?

1633
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,320
Is there any laughing or interesting point?

1634
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,140
There are some,

1635
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,050
but I found that

1636
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,330
I am much inferior to Xuan.

1637
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,820
What does that mean?

1638
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,290
I find that Xuan

1639
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,390
can play a comedian very well.

1640
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,140
On the first day I saw him,

1641
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,710
I thought

1642
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,670
he was charming, mature,

1643
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,750
and elegant.

1644
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,870
I was thinking how to

1645
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,480
play this amusing role well.

1646
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,880
When I stood beside him,

1647
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,170
I thought I was funny already.

1648
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,180
And…

1649
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,610
Xuan also helped me a lot.

1650
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,800
On the first day,

1651
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,950
I was really nervous

1652
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:47,930
and my mouth was trembling.

1653
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,230
My face trembled when I laughed at him.

1654
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,950
On the first day,

1655
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:51,470
we filmed a scene that

1656
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,330
he hit my face. I was so nervous.

1657
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,530
He was quite happy and very nice.

1658
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,700
He is responsible for

1659
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,420
the part presenting

1660
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,730
the profound history of “Luoyang”.

1661
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,720
And I am responsible for the frivolous…

1662
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,050
the superficial part.

1663
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,320
It’s the part that…

1664
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,430
It brings joy to the audience.

1665
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,180
It brings joy to the audience and relaxes them.

1666
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,210
OK. What does

1667
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,200
the role Bai Lang

1668
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,800
attract you most?

1669
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,230
I like its name very much.

1670
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,680
Bai…It means white waves.

1671
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,840
Little White Dragon in Waves. I added some names

1672
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,650
that are suitable for the role.

1673
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,510
And he is Xuan’s errand.

1674
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,450
Usually, Xuan asks him to do things that

1675
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,340
he doesn’t want to do in person. And Bai Lang will support

1676
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,210
and help him without hesitation.

1677
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,740
He is also the only person that Gao Bingzhu trusts

1678
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,450
at the beginning of the story.

1679
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,440
He protects Luoyang,

1680
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,680
while I Gao Bingzhu.

1681
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,780
Wow, it's impressive.

1682
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,950
He protects Luoyang,

1683
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,160
while I Gao Bingzhu.

1684
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,980
We're looking forward to your play.

1685
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:47,880
Well,

1686
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,170
now that several leading creators

1687
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,330
are on the stage,

1688
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,450
let's play a game.

1689
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,880
It seems that they've had a tacit understanding

1690
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,750
and teamwork spirit.

1691
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,830
I'll raise a challenge to them.

1692
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,320
I want to check

1693
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,940
whether it's true.

1694
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,480
It's about a game,

1695
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,640
called "Only I Have".

1696
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,310
Each of you stretches your 5 fingers.

1697
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,010
Let me show you.

1698
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,640
For example,

1699
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,670
I have the right to hold this press conference today,

1700
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,770
while you don't.

1701
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,620
If so, you have to bend one of your fingers.

1702
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,980
It's just an example.

1703
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,690
You seven can play this game.

1704
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,920
After a round,

1705
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,670
we can check who has the most unbent fingers.

1706
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,020
We hope

1707
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,500
you actors and actresses play this game

1708
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,050
according to the roles, such as Baili Hongyi,

1709
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,100
Gao Bingzhu and Wu Siyue.

1710
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,590
Our director and playwright

1711
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,080
also play the game in this way.

1712
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,740
OK?

1713
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,940
Jiang Long, you go first.

1714
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,830
You're just beside me.

1715
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,940
Show your five fingers.

1716
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,140
Do you have anything others don't have?

1717
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,310
I have Gao Bingzhu's trust.

1718
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,300
So do I.

1719
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,180
Oh?

1720
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,030
Gao Bingzhu also trusts himself.

1721
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,280
Does Yibo have it?

1722
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,240
I also have it later.

1723
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,330
So do I.

1724
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,290
Really?

1725
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,980
I think Gao Bingzhu also trusts director and playwriter.

1726
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,970
OK, I announce you all have Gao Bingzhu's trust in this round.

1727
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,940
Jiang Long has to bend one of his fingers.

1728
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,260
You made a trap for yourself.

1729
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,050
Well, Enjia.

1730
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,940
I have the secret passage map of
Chun Qiu Dao.

1731
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,520
Do you have it?

1732
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:15,710
No.

1733
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,630
Bend one of your fingers. Wu Siyue, do you have it?

1734
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:19,260
No.

1735
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,160
Bend one of your fingers.

1736
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,510
Do I have it in the end?

1737
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,440
Do I?

1738
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,780
You give it to me.

1739
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:25,890
Then I have it.

1740
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,330
Mr. Xie must have it.

1741
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,780
He has everything.

1742
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,390
You have to deduct a point.

1743
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,570
So do Mr. Wu.

1744
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,640
You think Mr. Wu also has everything.

1745
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,560
Mr. Wu, don't be nervous.

1746
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,770
You have the map

1747
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:38,720
as it was fabricated by you.

1748
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,370
Why did you bend one of your fingers?

1749
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,430
Stretch your finger.

1750
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,170
Well,

1751
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:43,950
Victoria.

1752
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,980
I have the Empress' Behest.

1753
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,450
Do the others have it?

1754
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,190
What's that?

1755
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,670
Do I have it? What's that?

1756
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,480
Bend one of your fingers.

1757
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,710
Just do it.

1758
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,790
Xuan directly bent one of his fingers.

1759
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,970
Do I have it later?

1760
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:58,850
No.

1761
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,260
Didn't you give me one?

1762
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,580
No, I didn't.

1763
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,480
OK.

1764
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,700
Do you have it, Mr. Xie?

1765
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,430
Mr. Xie thinks he has everything.

1766
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,620
Yes.

1767
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,590
He has everything.

1768
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,010
Mr. Xie, do you really have it?

1769
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,390
Answer yourself. We want to listen to your answer.

1770
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:15,980
He has it.

1771
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,270
The Empress' Behest is a token that

1772
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,400
can bring others convenience.

1773
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,810
I have it.

1774
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,270
What about Yibo?

1775
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,020
Did you bend one of your fingers silently?

1776
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,500
He doesn't have it.

1777
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,300
OK, let's go on.

1778
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,930
Xuan,

1779
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,720
do you have anything others don't have?

1780
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,660
I lay in a coffin.

1781
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,880
You lay in a coffin during the shooting of the play.

1782
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,650
I think Mr. Xie and Mr. Xu also have to lose this time.

1783
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,930
Jiang Long, did you do that?

1784
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,670
I lay in the coffin he used.

1785
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,600
In this play?

1786
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,240
I designed it in the play,

1787
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,460
but it wasn't shot.

1788
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,590
Do you believe it?

1789
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,060
What? That's incredible.

1790
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,700
Well, you won this time.

1791
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,770
Did you do it, Enjia?

1792
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,240
No, I didn't. I saw it.

1793
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,200
It doesn't count.

1794
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,050
Well, bend one of your fingers.

1795
01:01:59,070 --> 01:01:59,960
What about Victoria?

1796
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:02,050
No, I didn't. Then bend one of your fingers.

1797
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:02,940
You thought to have a try.

1798
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,420
Mr. Xie bent one of his fingers.

1799
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,920
I leaned against that coffin.

1800
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,080
You leaned against that coffin but didn't lie in it.

1801
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,200
What about Yibo? You didn't lie in it.

1802
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,660
OK. Mr. Wu also didn't lie in it.

1803
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:11,450
OK.

1804
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,290
Mr. Xie, it's your turn. Show your trump card.

1805
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,290
I have a strong man coat of small size…

1806
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,910
Do you know

1807
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,060
who made us laughed the most?

1808
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,500
Him.

1809
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,000
I don't know the inside jokes

1810
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,460
you guys have.

1811
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,270
So you guys decide whether you need to bend one of your fingers.

1812
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,150
I bend one of my fingers.

1813
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,050
We don't have it…

1814
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,040
All of you?

1815
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,830
We don't have it.

1816
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,210
OK.

1817
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,860
Wow. Yibo.

1818
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,010
You have only one unbent finger.

1819
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,450
Well,

1820
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,130
let me see whether you can secure yourself

1821
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:46,880
and win them in this round.

1822
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,140
I have "Shangke".

1823
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,440
Oh.

1824
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,310
I don't think others have it.

1825
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,740
Right. Bend one of your fingers.

1826
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,190
OK, it's Mr. Wu's turn.

1827
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,920
I've collected his…

1828
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,630
Prop.

1829
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,450
You've collected the prop.

1830
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,390
What about others?

1831
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,960
You were already out.

1832
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,410
Can you play a bit longer?

1833
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,600
Let me think whether I took away any prop.

1834
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,650
OK, just give up.

1835
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,430
What about Xuan?

1836
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,550
I have fingers left.

1837
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,920
Will you bend one of your fingers?

1838
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,970
You also have no prop.

1839
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:22,840
I already bent a finger.

1840
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:23,900
OK. You didn't bend your finger.

1841
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,800
I did it.

1842
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,650
You leave your little finger unbent.

1843
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,260
Mr. Xie, bend your finger.

1844
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,910
Yibo has it. I won in this round?

1845
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:29,490
Yes.

1846
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,690
Because it's your prop.

1847
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:30,980
OK.

1848
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,570
Now Mr. Wu leaves his little finger unbent.

1849
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:36,380
Yibo has one finger left.

1850
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,300
Mr. Xie has two fingers left.

1851
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,020

1852
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,120
Well, OK.

1853
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,930
Then let me announce who the winner is.

1854
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:48,020
Mr. Xie has two fingers still up.

1855
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:48,570
OK.

"Eternal…"

1870
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,080
Did they interpret it well? Are you satisfied?

1871
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,760
Yes.

1872
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,230
Very well.

1873
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,690
If so, can we light up another lantern?

1874
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,350
Yes.

1875
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:27,590
Please help us light up the lantern with the token "Eternal Luoyang",

1876
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:31,410
which was interpreted well in President Xiaohui's opinion.

1877
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,280
"Eternal Luoyang".

1878
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,330
Good. To interpret "Eternal Luoyang" well,

1879
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,260
