00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,340
I think you left Luoyang

192
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,530
several years ago.

193
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,460
I did.

194
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,780
I remembered the envoy from Daishan

195
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,370
came here at the beginning of that year.

196
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,260
They brought two lions

197
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,420
as gifts.

198
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,930
We went to see them together.

199
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
I never forgot

200
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,690
what you told me

201
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,020
on our way back.

202
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Lions in the cage

203
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,780
are no longer intimidating.

204
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,410
What a disappointment!

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,100
Although I'm from a prestigious family,

206
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,100
I never aimed for achievements in politics.

207
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,620
That's why I was always told off by my family.

208
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,340
What you said that day

209
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,820
was true wisdom

210
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,300
and suddenly enlightened me.

211
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,370
Did you leave home

212
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,650
and do business in the West

213
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,260
because of what I said?

214
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,740
I felt like a lion in the cage

215
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,490
at that time.

216
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,900
Later on, I left Luoyang

217
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
and went to the West

218
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,410
like a lion going back to the mountains.

219
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,050
I no longer

220
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,060
live within those frames.

221
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,820
What I said

222
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,210
was to myself.

223
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,860
Hongyi,

224
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,770
there should be

225
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
a lot of changes here

226
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,180
after I left.

227
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,940
Indeed.

228
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,620
I have things to do today.

229
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,060
You can go to the Baili Mansion

230
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,650
and stay there.

231
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,660
Thanks a lot.

232
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,460
I need to go back home first

233
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,860
to meet my uncle and my sister.

234
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,770
Liu Xiang

235
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,140
passed away already.

236
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,820
Your sister

237
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,890
is in the Baili Mansion as well.

238
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,180
What do you mean?

239
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,700
We got married.

240
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,370

241
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,860
Yes.

242
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,220
Find all the documents here

243
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,500
concerning Four Season Divine.

244
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,410
Bring anything related here.

245
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,620
Yes, sir.

246
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,010
Are you Li Ji?

247
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,640
[Li Ji, Member of the Royal Family]

248
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,650
I am.

249
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,060
Baili Hongyi sent me here.

250
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,300
Gao Bingzhu is back.

251
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,260
He immediately went to the Hall of Skills.

252
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
He is investigating Four Season Divine.

253
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,100
Ask him to see me.

254
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,020
Did he find

255
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,860
the real murderer?

256
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,810
I said this before.

257
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,740
I didn't kill

258
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,090
Kang Zhanbi.

259
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm here for the truth.

260
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,090
Tell me,

261
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,220
what happened exactly

262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,170
when Kang Zhanbi died?

263
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,610
Don't miss a single detail.

264
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,300
Sorry, I booked this room

265
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,660
a long time ago.

266
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,210
My guests will soon arrive.

267
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,020
Please let us have this room.

268

Get out.

269
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,020
If you're unhappy about this,

270
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,100
I can pay for

271
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,380
these dishes.

Get out!

What's going on?

275
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,010
What happened?

276
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,820
Did you say a woman

277
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,170
was sitting next to him?

278
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,340
Yes, I saw her.

279
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
The manager of Tianxiang House

280
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,940
and some waiters

281
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,850
saw her as well.

282
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,460
What about the wine cup

283
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,620
she put on the table?

284
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,540
Where did it go?

285
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,450
How could anybody know that?

286
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,850
The 16th Night is dead.

287
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,890
I thought you would never come back.

288
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,050
The 16th Night was gone,

289
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,540
but Four Season Divine is not.

290
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,170
As long as it exists,

291
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,980
there will be another 16th Night.

292
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,900
There will be more people

293
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,210
losing their lives.

294
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,420
Four Season Divine is the real trouble.

295
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,290
If we don't destroy it,

296
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,210
there won't be any peace.

297
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,090
Seems that your mind remains clear.

298
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,210
It's never been clearer.

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,940
We already found the mole.

300
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,460
The Services should go back to normal.

301
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,020
Should I learn

302
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,090
the cipher used in the Services?

303
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,530
You don't study music.

304
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,460
You can't.

305
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
Have you finally decided

306
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,980
to take the responsibility
as the Halberdier?

307
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,260
Then,

308
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,690
I hope you can follow

309
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,220
our rules first.

310

Don't do anything

311
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,180
like meeting the 16th Night on your own

312

without authorization.

313

He doesn't look like

the Gao Bingzhu I know.

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,140

Somehow, he lost his purpose in life.

You really changed a lot.

383
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,050
I almost didn't recognize you.

384
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,690
I could say the same to you.

385
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
You still remember

386
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,140
what I looked like!

387
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,980
Then, do you remember

388
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,170
that we went to the riverside...

389
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:11,940
Yunzhi,

390
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,810
give me a break!

391
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,340
Where is my sister?

392
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,700
There.

393
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,380
In the kitchen?

394
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,010
How dare they ask her

395
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,850
to keep an eye on servants herself?

396
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,450
Liu Ran!

397
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,700
Liu Ran!

398
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,170
Liu Ran!

399
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,580
Liu Ran!

400
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,020
Liu Feng?

401
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,300
Liu Ran.

402
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,060
Liu Feng!

403
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,380
When did you come back?

404
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,620
My little brother,

405
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,010
you finally came back!

406
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,180
Why didn't you

407
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,060
send us a letter

408
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,300
all these years?

409
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,410
When did you become so tall?

410
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,180
Let me have a look.

411
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,980
Here.

412
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,340
Why does

413
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,930
your face look dirty?

414
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,740
When did you come back?

415
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,330
How have you been these years?

416
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,140
-Liu Ran.
-Yunzhi!

417
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,220
You can't stay in the Baili Mansion.

418
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,020
Come home with me.

419
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,460
Liu Feng.

420
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,490
Liu Feng,

421
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,900
why is it?

422
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,260
Why can't I stay here?

423
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,410
When did we ever mistreat you like this

424
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,490
when you were at home?

425
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,060
You even cook now!

426
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,700
Liu Feng, come here.

427
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,460
I'll be honest with you.

428
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,010
I do these

429
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,860
because

430
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm willing to do so.

431
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,700
I don't have much to do

432
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,740
every day here.

433
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,770
I kind of enjoy doing this.

434
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,740
Yunzhi,

435
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,170
take him to the hall

436
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,650
and get his favorite food for him.

437
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,540
I'll be there...

438
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,250
Liu Ran, listen to me.

439
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,210
You have to come with me.

440
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,820
Liu Feng.

441
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,850
You can't stay here!

442
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,740
Come with me.

443
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,580
Liu Feng, stop it!

444
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:09,940
Stop it!

445
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,730
Let's go!

446
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,420
Stop.

447
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,900
Let's go.

448
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,820
Liu Feng!

449
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,860
Liu Ran!

450
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
Wait for me in the hall.

451
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,250
Liu Ran!

452
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,570
Wait outside.

453
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,540
Yunzhi,

454
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,490
here.

455
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,810
You go stay with Liu Feng.

456
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,180
Bring some food he likes

457
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,210
and make some tea.

458
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,140
Go talk to him.

459
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,340
I'll be there when the soup is done.

460
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,050
Yes.

461
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,260
Careful.

462
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,020
The black market?

463
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,010
My lord,

464
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
I grew up with you

465
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,920
in the Baili Mansion.

466
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,100
I don't even know

467
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
the entrance of the black market,

468
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,850
let alone the people inside.

469
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,220
I didn't ask you to find it.

470
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,410
Do you know where it is?

471
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:54,930
I don't,

472
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,940
but someone does.

473
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,570
Have a look!

474
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,980
Don't miss this opportunity!

475
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,460
Give it a try!

476
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,900
The glazed double-gourd vase for 30 coins.

477
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,530
The five-colored porcelain vase for 50 coins.

478
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,260
Also...

479
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,020
The most precious

480
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Changsha red porcelain vase.

481
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,370
I, Bai Lang,

482
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,900
swear on my life that

483
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,460
as long as you throw an arrow into a vase,

484
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,100
I will give you it for free!

485
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,650
Good!

486
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,580
Go on.

487
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,420
Come here, sir.

488
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,900
Bro,

489
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,900
can I win any of these

490
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,900
as long as

491
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,770
I throw an arrow into it?

492
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,580
You can, once the arrow is in the vase.

493
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,580
Okay.

494
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,930
I'll start with 5 arrows first.

495
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,940
One coin for one arrow.
You have to buy at least ten.

496
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,220
Okay, ten arrows then.

497
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,700
Great!

498
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,170
Here you go.

499
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,500
Okay.

500
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,010
Throw an arrow in the vase,

501
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,010
and the vase will be yours!

502
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,780
Bravo!

503
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,220
You threw it too hard.

504
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,700
You need to throw harder.

505
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Can you do it?

506
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,690
I can do it!

507
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,970
Relax.

508
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,970
Isn't this too difficult?

509
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,970
I don't think anyone can do it.

510
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,260
I'll give you another one for free.

511
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,730
No, that's enough.

512
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,860
Try this closer one.

513
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,940
You did it!

514
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,540
It's in!

515
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,820
It's in!

516
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,530
Well done!

517
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,220
It's in!

518
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,530
No!

519
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,410
That one doesn't count.

520
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,940
You said I can take it.

521
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,340
You...

522
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,890
I...

523
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,060
Bro!

524
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,850
Well done!

525
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,900
Well done!

526
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,540
Here you are. Thanks.

527
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,420
Thank you.

528
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,460
Okay.

529
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,300
Thanks for your help.

530
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,980
Bai Lang,

531
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,170
I've been practicing that

532
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,140
for years!

533
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,450
Is this what I get?

534
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll give you another one for free.

535
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,500
No, that's enough.

536
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,210
Try this closer one.

537
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,810
I'm done with it.

538
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,020
Your techniques were amazing,

539
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,730
but that happy expression on your face

540
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,060
was too much.

541
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,180
I can only give you these.

542
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,930
Take it or leave it.

543
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,660
I can find others next time.

544
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,530
Okay, I'll take it.

545
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,570
Good.

546
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,650
You're smart!

547
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,330
Bai Lang,

548
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,700
did you fool people again?

549
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,050
My vase!

550
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,090
Let's go

551
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,300
to the Henan Prefecture.

552
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,860
Bro,

553
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,020
destiny let us meet.

554
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,770
Please take this

555
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,980
and pretend we've never met.

556
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,660
Bro?

557
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,530
Lang,

558
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,100
you made a lot in such a short time.

559
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Give it back.

560
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,420
Shen Fei!

561
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,460
Wait.

562
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,780
Okay.

563
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,140
What happened, Shen Fei?

564
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,540
Lord Hongyi heard that

565
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,610
you know someone
from the black market well.

566
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,460
He wants you

567
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,780
to find something about an outlander
named Kang Zhanbi

568
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,060
and his companion Kang Jin.

569
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,140
Please help us

570
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,300
and see if anyone there

571
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,330
made fake identity documents for them.

572
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,500
If anyone met them before,

573
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,780
please tell us the details.

574
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,460
Beg me!

575
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,540
Don't you wanna help?

576
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,530
Then I'll take you

577
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,170
to the Henan Prefecture.

578
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,980
You'll stay in prison

579
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
for three to five months

580
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,010
considering the money you've earned.

581
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,570
Let's go.

582
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,980
Shen Fei, I'll help you.

583
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,860
I'll do it now.

584
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,660
I'll do it now.

585
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,580
The money...

586
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,060
Okay.

587
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,900
Let's make it clear, though.

588
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,060
You have to pay for this vase.

589
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,090
It's extremely valuable.

590
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,780
I know this.

591
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
A red porcelain vase
made in the black market.

592
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:43,970
Am I right?

593
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,850
Five coins each.

594
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,820
Right, I'll pay.

595
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,730
-Here.
-It...

596
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,210
Bai Lang,

597
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,050
this is for your vase.

598
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,930
Good.

599
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,180
I'll wait for your good news then.

See you next time!

[Tianxiang House]

604
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,460
Isn't Tianxiang House open today?

605
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,530
Since I opened my stall,

606
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,700
their door has been closed

607
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,610
for a whole day.

608
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
When did you come here?

609
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,900
Before dawn.

610
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,140
Several days ago,

611
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,450
a man died there

612
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,610
and they were still doing business.

613
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,220
It's quite strange.

614
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,980
Move!

615
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,380

Sir,

618
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,970
did anything happen to Tianxiang House?

619
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,740
Last night,

620
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,220
their manager's house was on fire.

621
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,180
All seven people

622
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,260
perished in that fire.

623
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,260
What caused the fire?

624
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,250
We looked into it.

625
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,690
They didn't put out

626
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,570
the fire in the kitchen.

627
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,700
The fire then spread

628
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,540
to the main hall.

629
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,370
They were all sleeping

630
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,700
and were burned to death.

631
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,850
What about his other relatives

632
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,700
and the staff?

633
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,420
Did you talk to them?

634
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,410
Anyone suspicious?

635
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,450
It's their family business.

636
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,500
All people working there

637
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,370
were his relatives.

638
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,210
They all died.

639
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,340
Someone wanted to silence them for good.

640
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,290
Bai Lang confirmed that

641
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,140
someone in the black market

642
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
saw Kang Zhanbi.

643
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,060
They came here

644
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,580
with a caravan.

645
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,540
That caravan

646
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,420
had more than 10 people.

647
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Any information about the caravan?

648
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,620
That's the strange part.

649
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,020
They didn't get their documents

650
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,780
forged in the black market.

651
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,660
Not in the black market?

652
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,180
Did they find

653
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,500
legal ways to do this?

654
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,300
The caravan

655
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,290
went to the black market several times,

656
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,220
but neither for identity documents

657
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,170
nor for businesses.

658
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,140
Nobody knew

659
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,100
why they were there.

660
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,860
If they had legal documents,

661
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,300
why did they
keep their whereabouts as a secret?

662
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,660
Why were they killed by rattle poison?

663
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,460
Rattle poison?

664
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,660
The one that killed Master Baili?

665
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,690
This caravan

666
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,140
must be hiding something.

667
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,900
Where are we going now?

668
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,700
Home.

669
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,020
So, our uncle's death

670
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,610
had something to do with Baili Hongyi!

671
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,420
How could you not blame him?

672
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,530
Liu Feng,

673
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,010
I've said this before.

674
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,490
Our uncle

675
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,300
did things wrong first.

676
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,220
Hongyi was just trying to

677
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,540
find out the truth.

678
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,340
Liu Ran,

679
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,860
what spell has he cast on you?

680
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,810
Even if he is a genius,

681
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,570
still, you should tell right from wrong!

682
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,940
He was the one

683
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,980
who killed our uncle!

684
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,130
Liu Feng,

685
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,300
stop this nonsense!

686
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,250
This isn't nonsense!

687
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,170
Liu Feng,

688
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,980
you just came back.

689
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,500
Don't argue with me.

690
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,210
Have some soup first.

691
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,930
If you have anything to say,

692
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,410
wait until you finish this.

693
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,100
Here.

694
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,180
Liu Ran,

695
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,340
you're no longer the person I know.

696
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,780
Have some soup.

697
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,220
What do you think?

698
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,010
What is this?

699
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,580
Beef soup.

700
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
Beef soup?

701
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,580
Is it good? Should I add more salt?

702
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,650
It's good.

703
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,100
Such a relief.

704
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,850
Wait.

705
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,340
You always like strong flavors.

706
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,820
If you find it tasty,

707
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,890
it must be

708
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,140
too salty for Hongyi.

709
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,040
Not good.

710
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,610
Yunzhi,

711
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,740
let's go back to the kitchen.

712
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,370
Liu Ran!

713
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,090
Liu Ran!

714
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,580
Welcome home, my lord.

715
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,460
Baili Hongyi!

716
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,620
Liu Feng

717
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,740
should be in the mansion.

718
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,690
Bring him here.

719
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,660
Liu Feng?

720
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,460
Did he come back?

721
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,460
When?

722
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,540
Baili Hongyi!

723
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,300
Baili Hongyi!

726
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,930
I'll make you pay...

727
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,500
What do you want?

728
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,570
One of us will die today!

729
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,700
Don't you move!

Baili Hongyi!

731
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,180
Show some respect!

733

Baili Hongyi!

734
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,450
You killed my uncle

735
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,660
and abused my sister!

736
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,060
I will kill you today!

737
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,540
Are you crazy?

738
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:42,860
Baili Hongyi!

739
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,540
Liu Feng!

740
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,420
Shut up!

741
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,540
Feng, stop!

742
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,980
Don't you move!

743
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,490

744
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,900
You!

745
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,090
What are you doing?

746
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,850
Liu Ran!

747
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,620
Liu Ran!

748
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,380
Hongyi,

749
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,180
are you alright?

750
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,820
Liu Ran.

751
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm fine.

752
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,020
He just came back

753
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,180
and he knew nothing.

754
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,740
Liu Ran!

755
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,740
Save it!

756
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,570
Hongyi.

757
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,130
Liu Feng, stop!

758
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,060
What are you doing?

759
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,900
Liu Feng, what are you doing?

760
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,930
Liu Feng!

761
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,810
We are from a prestigious family,

762
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,530
a family of scholars.

763
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,580
How could you become

764
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,850
such a rascal?

765
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,700
You finally asked

766
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,090
what I've been through these years.

767
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,020
You're right.

768
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,780
I didn't read a single book.

769
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,090
I traveled to different places

770
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,380
with merchants from the West.

771
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,820
If you think

772
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,450
I am a disgrace to the Liu family,

773
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,620
I can leave.

774
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,780
I won't care about

775
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,260
your marriage anymore.

776
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,810
Liu Feng, where are you going?

777
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,340
Wait!

778
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,820
Wait!

779
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,260
-You spent a long time in the West.
-Come back!

780
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,660
Have you heard about
caravans from the Ke Tribe?

781
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,330
Feng.

782
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,490
There were two outlanders

783
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,780
in this caravan from the Ke Tribe.

784
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,980
One is called Kang Zhanbi.

785
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,850
The other is Kang Jin.

786
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,890
Have you heard of them?

787
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,530
Why would I tell you?

788
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,580
Liu Feng,

789
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,290
please tell him if you know anything.

790
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,410
Liu Feng.

791
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,580
Kang Zhanbi died.

792
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,570
Kang Jin is missing as well.

793
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,820
It's none of my business.

794
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,060
I didn't do it.

795
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,100
We don't know where they were from

796
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,300
or where they had been.

797
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,860
If you know something

798
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,300
but keep it from us,

799
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,740
I'll report you immediately

800
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,260
and let the offices do the investigation.

801
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,210
Hongyi.

802
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,290
The Grand Court is known for its torture.

803
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,900
The Interior Guard Services is better,

804
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,410
but it'd be a living hell for you.

805
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,140
Hongyi.

806
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,180
And the Henan Prefecture as well.

807
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
I've heard that

808
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,490
no one has ever come out alive.

809
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,500
Baili Hongyi,

810
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,540
you're a monster.

811
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,060
Hongyi, he just came back.

812
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,220
He has no idea of what's going on.

813
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,060
Liu Ran, don't beg him.

814
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,460
Hongyi!

815
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,060
Liu Ran!

816
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,690
Liu Feng!

817
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,260
Do you see these?

818
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,580
I've been through everything.

819
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,180
Don't use this to threaten me!

820
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,540
I'm not afraid of torture.

821
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,460
Aren't you going to report me?

822
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,660
Go for it!

823
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,900
No? You are a coward!

824
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,890
[The Interior Guard Services]

825
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,020
Madam.

826
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,740
He was transferred to the Henan Prefecture.

827
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,700
Why?

828
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,020
Li Ji is a royal member.

829
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,900
That's why he was kept here.

830
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,260
As you said,

831
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,860
there are some reasonable doubts.

832
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,260
So, I immediately sent him there

833
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,970
for a reinvestigation.

834
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,340
When did he leave?

835
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,780
About two hours ago.

836
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,100
Anything wrong?

837
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,540
People who met that woman at Tianxiang House

838
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,730
all died mysteriously.

839
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,100
I think someone wants Li Ji dead, too.

840
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,900
Sir.

841
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,100
What happened?

842
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,090
Why didn't you tell me

843
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,580
about what you've suffered?

844
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,100
I was threatening him before.

845
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,220
It no longer hurts.

846
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,130
It's fine.

847
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,700
Here you are.

848
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,010
What's this?

849
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,340
It removes your scars.

850
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,330
It's good for you.

851
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm a man.

852
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,140
Take this!

853
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,170
Liu Ran,

854
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,980
actually, I know

855
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,500
the two men he asked about.

856
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,410
I just didn't want to tell him.

857
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,260
Liu Feng,

858
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,420
I know.

859
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,500
What you did just now

860
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,900
was not for our uncle,

861
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,050
but for me.

862
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,260
You are afraid that

863
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,740
they don't treat me well.

864
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,460
You met

865
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,290
Kang Zhanbi and Kang Jin?

866
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,179
Where?

867
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,460
On my way back to Luoyang,

868
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,100
a sand storm came

869
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,100
while we were in Gaochang.

870
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,420
More than 10 caravans stayed in an oasis

871
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,980
called Crescent Lake.

872
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,820
The caravan where Kang Zhanbi

873
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,500
and Kang Jin stayed was there as well.

874
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,739
What goods

875
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,580
were they carrying?

876
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,500
How could I know?

877
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,820
Liu Feng, think harder.

878
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,980
You said this before.

879
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,100
This caravan acted

880
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,340
secretly.

881
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,659
They kept a close eye

882
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,620
on the goods they carried.

883
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,860
Apart from

884
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,300
exchanging food or medicine,

885
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,180
they never talked

886
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,620
to other people.

887
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,700
What else?

888
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,090
Can you think of anything else?

889
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,940
Tell him all the details.

890
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,860
Don't hide anything.

891
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Your sister's right.

892
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,100
Think harder.

893
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,810
Liu Feng, think harder.

894
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,300
It seemed that they need to arrive

895
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,260
before a certain date.

896
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,300
So, they had set off

897
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,780
before the storm ended.

898
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,570
A certain date?

899
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,340
That's it.

900
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,220
This is all I know.

901
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,140
I'll go if you don't have other questions.

902
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,930
Wait.

903
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,250
What does Kang Jin look like?

904
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,170
Move!

905
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,810
Move!

906
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,690
Move!

907
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,930
Move!

908
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,010
Are you sure that he fell and died?

909
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,820
Madam.

910
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,170
It is said that

911
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,900
he jumped out to run away

912
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,140
and died here.

913
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,930
Did you see it with your eyes?

914
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,380
Madam,

915
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,810
he was driving the carriage

916
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,930
and I was following behind.

917
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,780
I heard someone hit the door twice.

918
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,940
He had jumped out

919
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,170
and died on the road

920
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,700
before I realized something was wrong.

921
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,140
How can't you keep a man safe?

922
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,140
Please forgive us.

923
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,420
Don't get angry with them.

924
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,490
Li Ji is important to us.

925
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,930
All the clues are gone now that he's dead.

926
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,810
Did he run

927
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,580
out of fear

928
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,220
and die?

929
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,210
What a coincidence!

930
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,700
The whole family of the manager
 of Tianxiang House died.

931
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,100
Now Li Ji died as well.

932
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,450
It seems that

933
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,330
he was targeted a long time ago.

934
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,050
They didn't find the chance

935
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,780
to kill him

936
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,890
as he was in our prison.

937
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,420
It's not right.

938
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Sir Wu decided to transfer Li Ji at the last minute.

939
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,220
How could someone

940
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,250
know much about this?
