00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,650
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,970
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,729
Baili Kuanren, the leader of Four Season Clan

6
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,250
has been sent to the dungeon.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,300
Well done, Youjue.

8
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,570
You've done such a great job.

9
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,009
How shall I reward you?

10
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,940
I dare not ask for any reward.

11
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,460
Your Majesty,

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,530
I made a wrong decision back then

13
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,330
and saved Baili Kuanren.

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,560
Luoyang was brought into such chaos
 because of me.

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,320
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,060
Everyone knows that

17
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,820
you are the big hero

18
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,540
that destroyed the Clan.

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,640
If I punish you now,

20
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,320
those fools

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,880
will criticize me for being incompetent.

22
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,520
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,760
Alright.

24
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,030
Although you made a mistake,

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,300
you did earn merit for Luoyang this time.

26
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,170
I'll deduct your salary for a year

27
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,810
as punishment.

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,290
Thank you for sparing my life, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,230
Let me ask you.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
Have you found the grain
 stolen from Hanjia Granary?

31
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,520
We've found all of it

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,670
and sent it to civilians

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,550
and shops.

34
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,440
Our people can now buy grain

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,450
at the market again.

36
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,720
I would like to invite Your Majesty

37
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,090
to hold an opening ceremony for the granaries
 on an auspicious day to boost morale.

38
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,190
Set it up.

39
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,030
As soon as possible.

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,329
Your Majesty, our country is blessed by your grace

41
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,010
and will be forever prosperous.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,740
Your Majesty, our country is blessed by your grace

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,329
and will be forever prosperous.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,300
Did you check everywhere?

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,190
Yeah.

46
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,860
You can't find them?

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,240
No.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,660
Did you find them?

49
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,290
No.

50
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,760
It's...

51
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,200
Sir!

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,960
-Sir!
-Sir!

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,880
We've checked everywhere.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,510
All the records

55
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,270
on the attack of the King of East River are gone.

56
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,070
I don't know

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,870
who took them.

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,980
What about records
 of the explosion of Hanjia Granary?

59
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,880
Many people saw the explosion.

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,430
There should be many testimonies.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,440
Not really.

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,150
We asked many people,

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,120
but they said they didn't know anything.

64
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,230
Was our Services penetrated by yet another mole?

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,880
Sir Wu.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,850
Agent Gao, you came.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,030
Have a seat.

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,720
The tea was harvested in autumn in Huzhou.

69
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,870
Southerners like to use boiling water

70
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,960
to brew tea leaves,

71
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,930
so it tastes different from boiling tea directly.

72
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,190
Have a try.

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,560
The tea set is not from Qianmu Chamber.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Good eye!

75
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,740
I brought the tea set myself.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,880
I brought them all with me

77
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,730
since I'll be staying here in the near future.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
I asked you to see me today

79
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,310
because I know that

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,870
there have been bad feelings between us.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,760
However, we're all serving the Court now,

82
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,030
so, I want to solve the problems between us.

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
I don't understand.

84
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,070
You should, though.

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,300
I know all about

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,640
you and Siyue.

87
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,000
However, you're now the Halberdier
 of the Intelligence Services.

88
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,640
You should know the rule here.

89
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,980
One shall forfeit the right to love.

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,260
What should Siyue do in the future?

91
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,490
I am here today to tell you

92
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,670
that rules are made

93
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,400
to be broken.

94
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,810
The rules Lord Chu made

95
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,770
are unnecessary.

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,330
He would never

97
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,710
make the Services more powerful.

98
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,070
You should never

99
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,290
hurt Siyue's heart.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,260
There's one more thing.

101
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,820
This time,

102
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,870
the two Services

103
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,810
found the grain stolen from Hanjia Granary.

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,030
You should send it to the Unwelcome Well

105
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,910
this afternoon.

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,600
The famine is now solved.

107
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,160
Her Majesty is relieved.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,940
She will reward the two Services for sure.

109
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,160
Besides, Her Majesty has issued an order

110
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,270
that she'll visit the south market shortly

111
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,240
to hold an opening ceremony

112
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,920
for the granaries to boost morale.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,810
Her Majesty will be there in person?

114
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,320
Yes.

115
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,510
So, we can't allow anything to go wrong

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
with the grain we've found.

117
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,580
I want to ask you to

118
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,390
safeguard the grain.

119
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,200
Can you do it?

120
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,030
I work for the Intelligence Services.

121
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,430
I'll do my best.

the man behind Four Season Clan

177
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,390

He doesn't value human life at all

179
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,840

Why?

276

There weren't any pear trees in the Well.

277

Every year, I had to wait

278
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,510
till the pears ripened and fell

279
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,400

Lord Pei, what's this?

383
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,100
It's a search warrant.

384
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,450
We're searching the entire city

385
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,050
[Grand Court]

386
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,170
for Yuwen Peipei, an entertainer at Hong Xiao Fang.

387
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,140
Her sketch is on the poster.

388
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,230
Keep an eye on her

389
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,150
when you're on patrol.

390
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,090
Report to me if you find anyone suspicious.

391
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,190
Listen up, fellas!

392
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,710
She's extremely dangerous!

393
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,090
Do not act on your own!

394
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,100
Yes, sir!

395
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,650
Greetings, sister.

396
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,310
The patrol officers are on a break.

397
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,400
No one will see you.

398
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,560
Hong Xiao Fang was shut down.

399
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,210
I have become a wanted person.

400
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,550
So...

401
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,900
I could only report to you in this way.

402
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,000
His Lordship said you've done a good job.

403
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,250
But I didn't kill the King of East River,

404
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,150
I...

405
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,290
His Lordship said that

406
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,520
it doesn't matter if he dies or not.

407
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,030
What matters is that

408
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,550
the assassination has made the evil Empress

409
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,320
distrust Lord Chu.

410
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,500
Without the King of East River,

411
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,510
the Intelligence Services

412
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,240
will not be able to fulfill its duty to supervise.

413
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,270
His Lordship is wise.

414
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,900
I've learned a lot.

415
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,180
It's just that...

416
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,240
If you need anything, just tell me.

417
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,540
I will pass it to His Lordship.

418
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,370
His Lordship helped me to get a new life,

419
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,420
and for that, I am deeply grateful.

420
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I'm willing to sacrifice my life to repay him.

421
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,920
I'd like to ask His Lordship to show grace.

422
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,890
After I complete my mission,

423
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,600
please, let me leave Luoyang.

424
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,090
You want to leave Luoyang?

425
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,730
Where do you want to go?

426
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,610
I haven't thought about it.

427
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,100
But over the years,

428
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,170
I've been dealing with all kinds of people

429
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,070
in that brothel.

430
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,270
I feel exhausted.

431
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,760
Now,

432
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,820
all I want is to leave Luoyang.

433
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,100
I could travel around the world

434
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,240
or live a reclusive life in the mountains.

435
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,110
I just don't want to come back ever.

436
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,460
It's natural that you want to leave here.

437
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,370
I will pass it to His Lordship.

438
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,300
You've made great contributions, after all.

439
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,770
I don't think

440
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,710
His Lordship will go hard on you.

441
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,990
Thank you, sister.

442
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,300
Sir.

443
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
The cleansing mud

444
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,280
is a royal product.

445
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,380
We waited a long time for this new batch.

446
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,740
After your fair lady

447
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
uses this product,

448
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,470
she'll look radiant,

449
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,980
beautiful and young forever.

450
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,710
Alright, I'll take three.

451
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,630
Okay.

452
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,640
Go wrap them up.

453
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,410
Liu...

454
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,630
Liu...

455
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,030
Liu Feng!

456
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,260
Chunhe, don't you know me?

457
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,600
I am Liu Feng!

458
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,810
♫Ignite those colorful dreams♫

459
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,510
What Chunhe?

460
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,710
I don't know anyone with that name.

461
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,980
♫When we bid farewell♫

462
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,590
♫We shall leave silently♫

463
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,430
I don't care if you're an assassin,

464
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,990
or Peipei of Hong Xiao Fang,

465
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,840
to me, you'll always be Chunhe.

466
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,520
♫Falling down♫

467
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,550
I can take you anywhere

468
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:16,340
♫In the air♫

469
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
in this whole wide world.

470
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,960
We'll never come back.

471
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,460
♫Waiting for the wind to bring you here♫

472
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,520
♫Waiting for the wind♫

473
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,570
Liu Feng!

474
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,050
♫Waiting for the wind♫

475
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,530
♫Waiting for the light to shine on me♫

476
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,640
He's right ahead.

477
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,600
♫Shine on me♫

478
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,910
♫In the air♫

479
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,550
♫Waiting for the dream to end♫

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,410
♫Waiting for it to end♫

481
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,500
Sorry.

482
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,080
♫Waiting for it to end♫

483
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,380
♫Stay here♫

484
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,820
Leave.

485
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,120
Yes.

486
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,760
How long has it been

487
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,310
since the last time we played chess together?

488
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,460
Do you remember what it was like back then?

489
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,390
You disobedient son!

490
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,280
You've been talking nonsense
 in public all the time.

491
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,580
If I don't teach you a lesson,

492
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,640
you'll get yourself in grave trouble!

493
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,440
Master!

494
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,830
Lord Kuanren is still young and has much to learn.

495
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,470
He knew he made a mistake, right?

496
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,350
I did nothing wrong!

497
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,610
The Empress now

498
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,210
talks about appreciating talents all the time,

499
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,510
-but she misuses cruel officials.
-Lord Kuanren, careful with your words!

500
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,430
They get to decide

501
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,480
who become officials!

502
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,530
They get to decide

503
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,960
who is talented!

504
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,840
Master!

505
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,280
What?

506
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,990
Master,

507
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,000
the interior guards are here

508
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,260
to investigate the article

509
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,230
Lord Kuanren wrote the other day.

510
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,480
Greetings, Sir Wu.

511
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,450
Lord Baili.

512
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,910
I've read Kuanren's article.

513
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,290
It was a bit extreme,

514
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,760
but it was well-written.

515
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,530
My son is a fool.

516
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,420
If he wrote anything inappropriate

517
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,510
or said anything wrong,

518
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,650
it was because I didn't teach him well.

519
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,310
Please, Sir Wu, do not punish him.

520
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,480
Sir Wu,

521
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,320
we didn't find it.

522
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,420
You didn't find it?

523
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,030
So, it must be a rumor, then.

524
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,800
However, since we've been tipped off,

525
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,860
we have to be extra diligent.

526
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,990
Keep looking.

527
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,660
Yes.

528
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,580
Lord Baili,

529
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,050
I want to

530
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,940
talk to Kuanren in private for a minute.

531
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,790
Please, Sir Wu.

532
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,040
Kuanren, you've always been good at chess.

533
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,880
Let's have a game, shall we?

534
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,810
You are good at chess.

535
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,820
On that day, however,

536
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,750
you were completely

537
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,390
defeated by me.

538
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,790
Kuanren,

539
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,260
you were talented back then.

540
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,110
But you were too young.

541
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,830
You didn't know what to do.

542
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,680
So,

543
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,200
you could only write
 useless poems and articles.

544
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,000
Weeds are all over the fields.

545
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,620
Set fire to them.

546
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,220
Nature has its order.

547
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,780
Separate the wheat from the chaff.

548
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,850
The nature of the four seasons

549
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,030
lies in Heaven and the Earth.

550
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,130
There was a rebel at North Sea Academy

551
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,060
called Lord Freedom.

552
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,120
He deceived many people,

553
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,630
recruited a lot of disciples,

554
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,060
and established Four Season Clan.

555
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,530
Kuanren,

556
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,260
you're one of his disciples, aren't you?

557
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,830
If you want to arrest me,

558
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,840
why didn't you do it earlier?

559
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,480
You think you can change your fate

560
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,740
by writing articles?

561
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,840
Why can't I?

562
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,600
As long as I can find

563
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,190
enough like-minded people,

564
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,160
even Her Majesty

565
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,630
will be able to hear what I've got to say.

566
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,930
I know what you're thinking.

567
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,700
You've always thought you're talented,

568
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,760
but you were born with an extra finger.

569
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,270
You're regarded as a misfit

570
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,320
and cannot be an official.

571
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,670
You're engulfed in anger.

572
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,280
However, you can't change anything,

573
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,420
because you're insignificant.

574
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,740
If there are weeds all over the fields,

575
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,050
we should set fire to them.

576
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,310
But what is fire?

577
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,700
It's power!

578
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,560
Her Majesty is the most powerful person

579
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,350
in the country.

580
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,570
If you can't overthrow her,

581
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,270
no one will ever

582
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,790
care about how enraged you are.

583
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,340
Now, the fire

584
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,730
is about to burn Her Majesty.

585
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,260
We once swore that

586
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,570
we'd turn this world upside down.

587
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,630
For all these years,

588
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,020
we've been enduring hardships

589
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,250
and taking risks.

590
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,640
Now, the old regime will be burnt down

591
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,330
by the fire we set

592
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,880
and a new one will be born!

593
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,790
Weeds are all over the fields.

594
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Set fire to them.

595
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,870
It's my honor to

596
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,620
see you,

597
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,270
Lord Phoenix!

598
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,100
The conversation

599
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,690
we had years ago

600
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,120
enlightened me.

601
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,470
I've kept your words in mind.

602
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,510
If you want to rule a country,

603
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,770
you need to win over the people.

604
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,240
To win over the people,

605
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,500
you need to win their hearts.

606
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,120
We've gone through

607
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,630
the darkest time in life.

608
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,950
We've endured all the ignorance

609
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,880
and humiliation.

610
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,060
Everything will change

611
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,750
from this moment on.

612
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,400
You promised me that

613
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,040
when you revise historical records,

614
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,220
you'll list me as the top
 of all nobles and officials.

615
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,500
All future generations

616
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,390
will read about my struggles, my rage,

617
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,390
my ambition, and my talent!

618
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
This day

619
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,950
will come soon.

620
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,310
Chunhe!

621
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,680
Chunhe!

622
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,680
Chunhe!

623
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,570
[Interior Guard Services]

624
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,370
Brother!

625
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,780
Brother, please don't be like this.

626
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,880
You're suffering.

627
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,720
I don't want to see you like this.

628
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,310
Siyue,

629
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,910
I am fine.

630
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,600
I'm doing this for us.

631
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,130
This is the only way

632
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,600
to prevent others

633
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,780
from bullying us.

634
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,290
Brother!

635
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,180
Brother!

636
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,250
Leave!

637
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,810
Brother, it's me.

638
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,730
Why are you here?

639
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,060
I want to keep you company.

640
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,800
Water.

641
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,520
Water.

642
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,820
Water.

643
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,280
Here.

644
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,110
Siyue,

645
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,510
don't worry about me!

646
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,860
I am fine.

647
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,550
Go back and have some rest.

648
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,739
Brother,

649
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,030
do you harbor any resentment?

650
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,650
Resentment?

651
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,590
Towards what?

652
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,820
Me.

653
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,780
You're the only family I've got

654
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,989
in this world.

655
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,389
Why would I harbor resentment towards you?

656
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,520
You got ill

657
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,010
because of me.

658
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,690
I know you became a food-testing officer

659
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,280
so that you could provide for me.

660
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,840
It had nothing to do with you.

661
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,870
Since we were kids,

662
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,390
we've been relying on each other.

663
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,540
I know how hard

664
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,850
it is for us distant relatives of the Wu family

665
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,190
to gain a foothold in the Court.

666
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,540
So,

667
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,140
you took the job as a food-testing officer.

668
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,910
Food-testing officers

669
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,630
need to try food
 for Her Majesty to make sure it's safe.

670
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,810
Only by this

671
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,210
could you earn Her Majesty's trust...

672
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,520
Enough.

673
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,660
Stop.

674
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,200
I know that

675
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,880
you care about me.

676
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,660
But you must remember

677
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,760
not to tell anyone

678
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,160
about this ever again.

679
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,400
You have to get rid of this thought.

680
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,780
When everything is back to normal in Luoyang,

681
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,860
you can leave all this behind

682
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,820
and focus on recovery

683
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,750
and getting better.

684
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,640
Didn't you say that

685
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,400
you want to travel to Jiangnan?

686
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,170
I'll go to Jiangnan with you,

687
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,840
alright?

688
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,830
Now,

689
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,720
I need to shoulder the burden

690
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,110
of managing both Services.

691
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,900
I won't be able to get away any time soon.

692
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,820
Didn't I give you the ring puzzle?

693
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,550
Have you worked it out?

694
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,850
Hongyi,

695
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,870
I yelled at you at the study.

696
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,130
Don't be mad at me.

697
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,310
You won't even

698
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,490
greet your own brother?

699
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,770
I remembered that you hadn't reached my shoulder
 when I left home.

700
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,160
Hongyi,

701
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,840
do you not think of me as your brother anymore?

702
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,570
Go back.

703
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,720
I will meet Father soon.

704
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,620
I will ask for his forgiveness.

705
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,000
Baili Kuanren, the leader of Four Season Clan,

706
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,970
who calls himself Lord of Spring,

707
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,520
is vile and cruel. He's killed innocent people

708
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,540
and destroyed Hanjia Granary,

709
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,930
bringing Luoyang into grave chaos.

710
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,660
According to Her Majesty,

711
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,140
he is vicious and should be despised by all.

712
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,030
He shall be executed

713
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,540
publicly at the market

714
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,270
[South Market]

715
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,430
today at noon.
