[Episode 28]

4
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,700
Since when do we

5
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,900
take orders from you?

6
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,690
Hold on!

7
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,700
Do as he says!

8
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,740
What genius plan do you have?

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,580
I am all ears.

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,700
I don't think

11
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
you can figure out where Baili Hongyi is kept

12
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,090
just by watching over here.

13
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,530
We need to find a way

14
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,540
to let Hongyi know

15
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,340
we are here.

16
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,490
Well, what way?

17
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,420
Zhang, make something nice!

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,660
No problem.

19
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm off!

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,730
[Hanjia Granary, Luoyang]

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,450
His Highness and I are here to check inventory

22
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,820
of the Granary by order of Her Majesty.

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,340
Sir Wu, thank you

24
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,410
for escorting us here.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,930
Madam Yang, it's my pleasure.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,450
It is the interior guards' job

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,930
to protect you and His Highness.

28
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,370
Besides,

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,020
you're here by order of Her Majesty.

30
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,930
So, we shall be extra diligent.

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,450
Youjue, is this the first time

32
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,420
for you to visit Hanjia Granary?

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,170
I passed it by when traveling
 between Luoyang and Chang'an.

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,460
This is the first time I've ever set my foot in here.

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,300
I've long heard that

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,980
Hanjia Granary is the livelihood of Luoyang.

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,050
Now that I've seen it,

38
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,580
I am more convinced that it's true.

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,340
Indeed.

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,820
The crops enough for 200,000 households
 and millions of people

41
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,290
are all stored in the Granary.

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,940
No wonder Her Majesty

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,180
thinks of it as crucial.

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,540
Her Majesty cares about
 the wellbeing of the people.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,900
We all feel utterly grateful

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,460
to be able to serve her.

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,300
Indeed.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,820
Your Highness, Her Majesty let you

49
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,010
take charge of inventory.

50
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,780
It shows her high expectations for you.

51
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,300
Hongyi,

52
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,690
ever since we got married,

53
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,610
I've done nothing to help you.

54
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,060
All I did was to get you in trouble.

55
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,380
We are here because of me...

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,050
Liu Ran,

57
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,970
we are married.

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,650
We are supposed to

59
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,930
be each other's rock.

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,420
Ever since we got married,

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,180
you've always been understanding.

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,770
Our life has been in harmony.

63
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,820
I feel quite nice about it.

64
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,500
I knew it!

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Hongyi, you went to

66
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,380
18 cosmetic stores in Luoyang to find me

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,940
and you drew a portrait for me.

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,940
You must care about me.

69
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,850
I'm glad you like it.

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,100
Thank you, Hongyi.

71
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,540
Anyway, I'll never leave your side

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,250
for the rest of my life.

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,370
Zhang!

74
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,540
Coming!

75
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,580
What's for dinner?

76
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,100
I made hoto noodle soup.

77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,180
Come on, open it.

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,820
Have a look!

79
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,540
Is this even human food?

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,420
Well, they can have it.

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,010
I won't eat any.

82
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,020
Open the door.

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,260
See you!

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,930
Hongyi,

85
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,450
did they send you food?

86
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,570
You should eat first, Liu Ran.

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,340
I am not hungry.

88
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,700
Hongyi, have some food, please.

89
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,300
Or I'll keep worrying about you.

90
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,940
Okay.

91
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,170
Let's eat together.

92
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,420
Weren't you worried that

93
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,170
I didn't get your hint?

94
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,020
Sir!

95
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,620
Sir!

96
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,770
Where were you

97
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,940
sending the food?

98
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,460
I was

99
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,900
delivering food for the Taoist priests

100
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,610
in the house ahead.

101
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,660
Do you do it every day?

102
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,100
Not really.

103
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,690
That house was empty,

104
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,420
but not long ago, some Taoists came.

105
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,380
I happen to live downhill,

106
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,930
so it's quite convenient for me

107
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,970
to deliver meals for them.

108
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,010
When you were there today,

109
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,850
did you see

110
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,820
a young couple?

111
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,700
No.

112
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,140
Sir,

113
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,420
I want to make a deal with you.

114
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,340
What deal?

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,460
Do you know how to make hoto noodle soup?

116
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,540
Of course.

117
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:41,940
Liu Ran.

118
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,820
I am here.

119
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,050
I've got a plan.

120
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,180
Wait for me here.

121
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,580
Hongyi, where are you going?

122
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,540
Hongyi, be careful!

123
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,300
Hello?

124
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,370
I want to see Taoist Tiantong!

125
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,460
Do you think you're a distinguished guest?

126
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,010
How can you see Master Tiantong as you wish?

127
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,580
There is a special ingredient missing
 in his formula.

128
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,180
He'll never figure it out.

129
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,100
Take me to him

130
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,340
and I will tell him.

131
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,500
Hongyi is out.

132
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,460
What is he doing?

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,060
He's trying to tell us

134
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,900
where Liu Ran is.

135
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,060
Move! Why are you standing there?

136
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,580
I've been inside for a whole day.

137
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,620
I was just stretching.

138
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,050
Now that we've known where they are kept,

139
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,020
let's save them right now!

140
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,260
It's not time yet.

141
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,650
Tell me, then.

142
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,860
When shall we take action?

143
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,370
Wait.

144
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,220
Add more wood.

145
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,180
Fan the flames.

146
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes.

147
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,210
Add ice after the fire gets bigger

148
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,140
to balance the temperature in the furnace.

149
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,090
Control the heat.

150
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,300
Master.

151
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,740
Who told you to bring him here?

152
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,060
Well, it's good that you came.

153
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,340
I've figured out the secret.

154
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,650
The key is the heat.

155
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,730
Now that you're here,

156
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,260
you can witness my success.

157
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,840
The key to making elixirs is not the ingredients,

158
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,250
but the heat.

159
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,860
If others hear you say it,

160
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,020
you'll become a laughingstock.

161
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,020
Adding ice will only
 make the fire intensified.

162
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,780
You need to add some apatite of cooling nature

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,810
to balance the heat.

164
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,220
Apatite?

165
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,770
If I do that,

166
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,420
the furnace will explode for sure.

167
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,580
I've been practicing alchemy for ages.

168
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,050
Do you think I'll believe

169
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,370
a rookie like you?

170
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,180
Although you've been doing it for ages,

171
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,620
it was me that told you

172
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,660
to keep the fire from getting too big.

173
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,770
It's commonsense that

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,340
apatite can fan the flames,

175
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,890
which may cause the furnace to explode.

176
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,340
However, few people know that,

177
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,420
as recorded by Ge Hong in The Baopuzi,

178
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,410
apatite has a cooling nature.

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,420
With the right proportion,

180
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,370
it can cool down the furnace

181
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,420
and keep the heat balanced.

182
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Nonsense!

183
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,460
I've tried it myself.

184
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,820
You can simply try it

185
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,300
and see if I am lying.

186
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,540
However, if you succeed,

187
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,050
you must release Liu Ran and me.

188
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,890
Master,

189
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,500
he's acting so mysteriously.

190
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,740
Do not believe him!

191
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,620

197
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,770

200

Don't worry!

214

Where is Liu Ran?

224
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,780

227

Yes, I am.

231
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,860
It's over. Let's go home.

232
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,940
Where is Gao Bingzhu?

233

Where did he go?

241
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,980
He just went into the cave.

242
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,900
I think it's copper from Mount Lian.

243
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,540

It's called the Thunder.

This is, after all,

287
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,410
I didn't mean anything.

00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,860
I'll move the rock

385
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,730
so you can get it out.

386
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,220
Come on!

387
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,900
Lift your leg a bit.

388
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,770
Hang in there.

389
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,420
Alright.

390
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,060
This will stop the bleeding for now.

391
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,740
What was inside the box?

392
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,850
How come it's so powerful?

393
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,970
Now is not the time to discuss this.

394
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,620
I'll go and find an exit.

395
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,330
Gao Bingzhu!

396
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,300
Gao Bingzhu, careful!

397
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,860
Anyone there?

398
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,420
Help!

399
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

400
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
May Your Majesty be blessed with longevity

401
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,220
and infinite glory.

402
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,260
Youjue, you're here.

403
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,580
You're in poor health.

404
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,290
There's no need for formalities.

405
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,060
Do you know why I asked to see you?

406
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,730
The case of the informers is not closed yet.

407
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,460
I didn't do my job well.

408
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,490
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

409
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,700
You've been working hard for me.

410
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,170
Why would I punish you?

411
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,540
Sir Wu of the Interior Guard Services,
 please take the order.

412
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,620
I am all years, Your Majesty.

413
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,290
Sir Wu is an outstanding member of the Wu family

414
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,810
and a reliable talent of the country.

415
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,410
Although he is in poor health,

416
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,290
he still fulfills his duty to protect the country.

417
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,850
Therefore, he shall be granted
 the title of Duke of Ying.

418
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,140
He'll be rewarded a fief of 300 households,

419
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
effective immediately.

420
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,170
Thank you, Your Majesty.

421
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,650
It must hurt badly, right?

422
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,260
All the interior guards knew

423
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,250
that I went to look for you.

424
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,570
I believe that they'll come and find us

425
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,980
since we have

426
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,260
gone missing for so long.

427
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,260
Yes.

428
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,900
You're right.

429
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,060
They will come and find us for sure.

430
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,260
Siyue,

431
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,020
our top priority right now

432
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,010
is to save energy

433
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,100
and wait for them,

434
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,530
okay?

435
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,580
Don't worry!

436
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,020
Recently,

437
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,810
I've been busy working on the case.

438
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
I couldn't remember the last time

439
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,460
I've sat quietly like this.

440
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,460
I feel relieved, actually.

441
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,940
You handled the Crown Prince situation well.

442
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,660
The Interior Guard Services has been thriving

443
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,260
under your leadership.

444
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,380
I've been saving the title of Duke of Ying for you

445
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,140
for a long time.

446
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,500
I am deeply grateful

447
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,580
for your grace, Your Majesty.

448
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,610
I only wish for Your Majesty to live long

449
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,380
and forever!

450
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,700
Forever?

451
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,850
Outsiders can say this

452
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,660
all they want.

453
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,220
We're family.

454
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,010
What's the point of fooling ourselves?

455
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,700
I am old.

456
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,090
Who knows how long I'll live?

457
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,570
The Heaven Project

458
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,180
is my only wish that hasn't been realized.

459
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,540
It's been 20 years.

460
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,730
Finally,

461
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,580
it's due for completion.

462
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,530
I want to paint the statue of Buddha gold
 in the Heavenly Temple

463
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,540
and light a candle myself.

464
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,460
On the day of the Ceremony of Light,

465
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,540
I want you

466
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,140
to be in charge of security.

467
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,060
I will do my best.

468
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,140
I won't let you down, Your Majesty.

469
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,090
My lord.

470
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,230
[Dragons and snakes slither around,
 looms are hidden outside the capital by Baili Kuanren]

471
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,090
[Dragons and snakes slither around,
 looms are hidden outside the capital.]

472
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,490
[Stars are buried underground,
 mountains overlook the crowd by Baili Kuanren]

473
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,700
[Stars are buried underground,
 mountains overlook the crowd by Baili Kuanren]

474
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,420
Brother,

475
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,050
The Nine-Linked Rings puzzle
 is too difficult to solve.

476
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,050
I've tried everything,

477
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,290
but they're still separate rings.

478
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,900
I can't make a loop out of them.

479
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,660
Do you think

480
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,780
my brother is still alive?

481
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,810
My lord!

482
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,400
[The Interior Guard Services]

483
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,650
I was trying to

484
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,060
secure the position of Minister of War for you.

485
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,900
However, Her Majesty never said yes.

486
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,010
To be honest,

487
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,060
to be Duke of Ying

488
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,060
is an honor, indeed,

489
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,890
but it's nothing more than a title.

490
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,820
The Minister of War, on the contrary,

491
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,340
holds real powers.

492
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,890
In fact, I am happy enough to be able to

493
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,810
shoulder burdens

494
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,450
for Her Majesty and you, Your Highness.

495
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,700
We're cousins. No need for these nice words.

496
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,460
Don't get upset yet!

497
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,570
Her Majesty

498
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,490
asked you to take charge of the Ceremony of Light.

499
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,970
If you do a great job,

500
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,420
Her Majesty will most likely reward you.

501
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

502
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,340
It's a pity that

503
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,010
Her Majesty might let go of the Dai Zhou case.

504
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,220
She only grounded the Crown Prince
 for self-reflection.

505
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,650
What a pity!

506
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,300
Your Highness,

507
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,450
we are at Her Majesty's service.

508
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,730
All we need to do

509
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,450
is to share Her Majesty's burdens.

510
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,890
You need to be discreet

511
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,060
on certain matters.

512
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,220
Sir Wu!

513
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,700
Sir Wu!

514
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,620
How dare you!

515
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,699
Please forgive him, Your Highness.

516
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,060
What?

517
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,500
My lord!

518
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,460
My lord!

519
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,449
Uncle!

520
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,130
The interior guards are here.

521
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,540
Baili Hongyi!

522
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,020
Baili Hongyi!

523
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,330
Siyue has gone missing.

524
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,370
I don't even know if she's alive.

525
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,409
I was told that

526
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,690
when she went missing,

527
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,900
a loud noise came from the North Mountain.

528
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,060
It was deafening!

529
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,500
It must have something to do with her missing.

530
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,690
What do you know?

531
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,530
Tell me!

532
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,540
Come on! Tell me!

533
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,500
Was the North Mountain House

534
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,090
destroyed by interior guards?

535
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,370
It was my fault.

536
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,650
I was being

537
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,730
negligent.

538
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,460
Someone!

539
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,780
Cut off his hand.

540
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,330
Yes.

541
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,020
Please don't!

542
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,860
I...

543
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,700
I've figured out

544
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,940
-the secret of the Thunder!
-Wait.

545
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,140
Brother,

546
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,570
who knows if he has

547
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,490
really made it?

548
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,340
Maybe, he's just trying

549
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,460
to make up some excuses.

550
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,380
I say, we just cut off his hand.

551
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,820
We can try it and see if he's telling the truth.

552
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,380
If he's lying,

553
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,530
we can still cut off his hand later.

554
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,810
If he's telling the truth,

555
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,320
are we going to make the Thunder

556
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,900
by ourselves if his hand is cut off?

557
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I still haven't figured out

558
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,380
what exactly the Thunder does.

559
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,820
I only know it's extremely powerful.

560
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,810
It can even blow Tiantong's furnace into pieces.

561
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,020
How dare Tiantong

562
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,860
use that against Siyue?

563
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,770
If I guessed right,

564
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,300
that thing is extremely explosive.

565
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,890
It needs to be kept away from light.

566
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,740
It's likely that Tiantong hid it

567
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,050
in some shady area in the North Mountain.

568
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
Everyone! Go to the North Mountain with me!

569
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,650
I'll come with you.

570
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,980
No need.

571
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,010
Siyue got herself in danger because of you.

572
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,780
If she's safe, I'll spare you.

573
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,060
If she's not,

574
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,780
I'll kill you.
