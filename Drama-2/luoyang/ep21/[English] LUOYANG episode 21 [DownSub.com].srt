00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,440
and put aside for three days

194
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,410
before the funeral services.

195
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
If I guessed right,

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,010
Kang Zhanbi's body

197
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,120
is here

198
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
right now.

199
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,410
Well...

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,090
Sir!

201
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,090
You finally avenged your friends' death.

202
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,680
All your sufferings

203
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,810
are worthwhile.

204
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,240
It's worth celebrating.

205
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,840
We can get drunk today.

206
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,720
You're working for the Intelligence Services.

207
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,680
You could've lived in a better place.

208
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,730
Why are you still staying here?

209
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Is it not nice here?

210
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,440
I quite like this place.

211
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,080
Actually, I don't like to

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
be surrounded by people.

213
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,890
I'm afraid of vitality.

214
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,920
Roadside flowers

215
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,730
and people of all kinds

216
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,930
are right around me

217
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,400
but they have nothing to do with me.

218
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,080
Those things are like

219
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,690
a constant reminder that

220
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm living like an underdog.

221
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,890
This place is good.

222
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,360
No one is here.

223
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,480
It smells like death.

224
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,130
I feel at ease here.

225
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,560
Well,

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
you aren't even close to an underdog.

227
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,520
My life is worthless.

228
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,810
The only reason I stay alive

229
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,570
is to get revenge.

230
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,680
It is the sole purpose

231
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,960
of my life.

232
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,280
Now it's done.

233
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,599
Rattle poison.

234
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:13,690
It's him.

235
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,680
Get him.

236
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,280
Go.

237
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,530
How did he get in?

238
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,430
We are closed.

239
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,930
He broke in.

240
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,520
I think

241
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
we should report to the officers.

242
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,770
Those constables badgered us

243
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,410
because Kang Zhanbi

244
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,440
is dead.

245
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
Do you still want to report to them?

246
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,620
[Manager Qin, Guanglin Inn]

247
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,760
Lord Hongyi, it's you!

248
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,390
My lord,

249
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,130
what are you...

250
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,840
I was thinking

251
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,880
about inviting you

252
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,320
to try our dishes

253
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,320
and give some comments.

254
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,570
Surprisingly,

255
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,570
you just showed up

256
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,400
today.

257
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,080
There you go.

258
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,920
Try some.

259
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm not here for the food.

260
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,410
My lord, do you not like

261
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,160
these cold plates?

262
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:58,890
How about

263
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,280
I ask the cooks

264
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,720
to make some hot dishes now?

265
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm really not here to dine.

266
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,690
It's fine, my lord.

267
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,090
Could you please

268
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,650
have a look and see

269
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,000
if there are two characters missing?

270
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,280
Kang Zhanbi died at Tianxiang House.

271
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,290
Why did you

272
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,490
take his body back here?

273
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,680
It's the inn's rule.

274
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,890
If customers die

275
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,800
in accidents,

276
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,170
our inn will be responsible

277
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,410
for disposing of the bodies

278
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,960
and waiting for their family to collect them.

279
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,210
If a body isn't collected,

280
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
we will have it buried.

281
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,490
You're quite kind.

282
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,080
It has been two days since he died.

283
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,160
Didn't his family or friends come?

284
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,880
Well, he was an outlander

285
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,010
and stayed here alone.

286
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,050
He didn't have family or friends.

287
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,440
No one asked about him

288
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,290
in the past two days.

289
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,810
What did he do?

290
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
He didn't mention it,

291
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,600
so we didn't ask.

292
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,840
Where are his belongings?

293
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,450
People from the authorities came here

294
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,330
and took them away as evidence.

295
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,920
Which room did he stay?

296
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,920
I want to stay there for one night.

297
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,250
I don't think it's appropriate.

298
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,360
The person who stayed there died

299
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,010
and it hasn't been deeply sanitized.

300
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,960
Madam.

301
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,890
What happened?

302
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
Sir Li illegally imprisoned Lord Hongyi.

303
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,880
He is being punished.

304
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
Come with me to Merits Casino.

305
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Sir Wu asked me to

306
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,120
be on my knees

307
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,920
for 24 hours.

308
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,080
You did it for me.

309
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,050
He should've punished me.

310
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,570
I'll explain to him later on.

311
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,280
Let's go.

312
00:19:59,330 --> 00:19:59,690

313
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,770
was released by Sir Wu.

314
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,890
I couldn't stop him.

315
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,760
Where did he go?

316
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,170
Lady Liu Ran picked him up.

317
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,760
I guess they went back home.

318
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,280

320
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,360
and then tell the Grand Court

321
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,400
to close the casino.

to bring this here

he wrote it?

you can stay here for as long as you wish.

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,400
You and your friends

575
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,080
used to mess around every day.

576
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,720
You deserved it.

577
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,490
Now my friends are all dead

578
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,480
and I'm the only one alive.

579
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,690
You're my only family

580
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,480
in the Ghetto.

581
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,690
Not true.

582
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,290
Are you not looking

583
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,480
for your sister Tan anymore?

584
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,040
It's been five years.

585
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,480
I searched everywhere in Luoyang.

586
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,960
There is no way I can find her.

587
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:45,810
Mr. Unsightly,

588
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,409
If I hadn't brought my friends to Luoyang,

589
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,080
they would have been alive like these people.

590
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,960
A bunch of underdogs.

591
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,570
Bingzhu,

592
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,650
you're more traveled than me.

593
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,010
Do you think our people

594
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,960
are really that bad

595
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,050
when they are outside the Ghetto?

596
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,010
Of course not.

597
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,080
We are like rats

598
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,800
living in the Ghetto.

599
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,720
We live in the shadows.

600
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,640
I know

601
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,950
you wanted them

602
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,600
to lead a decent life.

603
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,610
You didn't kill your friends.

604
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,690
You don't have to be

605
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,080
so hard on yourself.

606
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,360
You are overthinking everything.

607
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,570
Mr. Unsightly,

608
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,120
I spent so many years

609
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,490
looking for my enemy.

610
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,610
I never stopped doing that.

611
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
Now it's all done.

612
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,520
I can finally have

613
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,600
a peaceful mind to think.

614
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,690
The 16th Night killed my friends

615
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,810
but she was only

616
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,080
a puppet.

617
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,800
The puppeteer

618
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,050
is still in hiding.

619
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,080
What?

620
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,410
Do you think killing her

621
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,290
isn't enough to soothe your pain?

622
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,560
To me, Wang Dengcheng

623
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
and the 16th Night

624
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,290
did evil things

625
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,410
to benefit themselves.

626
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,530
I don't feel sorry for them.

627
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,680
However, the people behind them

628
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,840
are using them to achieve

629
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,050
what they want

630
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,120
at all costs.

631
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,200
They are worse.

632
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,770
They will end up being punished.

633
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,090
I don't think they can get away with it.

634
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,080
You've done

635
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,520
what you should do.

636
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,810
You can leave the rest

637
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,120
to more capable people.

638
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,360
Anyway,

639
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,200
forget about it.

640
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,610
You've got your revenge.

641
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,600
You can come home.

642
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Home?

643
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,290
How ungrateful you are!

644
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,450
How could you forget your home?

645
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:13,970
Listen,

646
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,650
the Ghetto will always be your home

647
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,640
no matter how

648
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,520
the folks here have condemned you.

649
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,770
I will keep on going

650
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,050
at least for my home.

651
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,360
Does it mean you got over it?

652
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,970
At least I realized

653
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,850
that my life is still purposeful.

654
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,480
Yao became the 16th Night

655
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,160
and killed so many people.

656
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,410
Wang Dengcheng betrayed the Ghetto

657
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,560
and nearly destroyed our home.

658
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,320
There must be a conspiracy behind all this.

659
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,600
The things I care about

660
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,120
could be destroyed in the future.

661
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm still useful.
