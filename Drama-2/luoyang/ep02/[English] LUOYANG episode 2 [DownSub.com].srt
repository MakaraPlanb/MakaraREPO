[Episode 2]

4
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,610
Master Gao.

5
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,270
Master Gao.

6
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,470
He is Baili Erlang,

7
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,470
the second son of Baili Yan,

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,470
the Minister of Ministry of Works.

9
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,190
Court of Judicial Review has nothing to do with the Ministry of Works.

10
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,020
Why are you here then?

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,350
In the chaos yesterday,

12
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,670
a pair of father and daughter was killed.

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,950
I would like to look at their bodies.

14
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,590
What do you think the Court of Judicial Review is?

15
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,030
These are the bodies of an important case.

16
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,190
You can't see them as you like.

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,789
Master Gao.

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,230
The identities of these two are in doubts.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,590
I hope to see them with my own eyes.

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,310
Do you have any important clues?

21
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,070
No.

22
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,470
I need to interrogate a criminal.

23
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,660
Please leave.

24
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,590
Is it Gao Bingzhu?

25
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,030
I hope I can observe it.

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,860
Ridiculous.

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,670
Send him off.

28
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,590
Yes sir.

29
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,190
Baili Erlang.

30
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,230
Please.

31
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,590
Gao Bingzhu,

32
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,950
why did you kill him?

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,350
Since you have killed him,

34
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,550
why did you turn yourself in?

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
There are traps everywhere.

36
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,710
I can't escape.

37
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,110
What do you know about

38
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,430
the assassination of the South City?

39
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,110
Yuehua!

40
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,380
This is the Court of Judicial Review,

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,750
not the Inner Guards' Office.

42
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,670
It's not your job to interrogate.

43
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,830
Master Gao.

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,150
This person has killed

45
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,270
the suspect of the assassination of the South City.

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,510
It is about the safety of the royal family.

47
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,300
Of course the inner guards have the rights to interrogate.

48
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,310
I allow you to watch,

49
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,990
I'm already doing the Imperial Attendant a favour.

50
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,910
Don't push your luck.

51
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,430
Guards.

52
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,070
Put him in jail.

53
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,590
Yes sir!

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,190
Wait a minute!

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,630
There's still some doubt in this case.

56
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,390
If there is any doubt,

57
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,430
we will investigate.

58
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
Allow me to ask two more questions.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,910
The written instructions from the empress.

60
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,470
Announcement from the official of the Court of Judicial Review, Gao Sheng,

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,829
and the inner guard, Yuehua,

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,750
see the empress in the palace at once.

63
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,950
At the empress' command.

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,900
[Xianju Hall]

65
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,390
[Xianju Hall, Taichu Palace]

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,510
Regarding the assassination in the South City,

67
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,710
does the Court of Judicial Review have any conclusion?

68
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,710
This case...

69
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,790
is still under investigation.

70
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,190
It is still unsolved.

71
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,870
I heard that the only captive

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,250
[A noble: Yang Huan]

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,430
was killed in the jail in the Court of Judicial Review?

74
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,630
Is that true?

75
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,470
Please forgive us, empress.

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,310
It was due to my oversight.

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:34,990
Luckily...

78
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,990
Luckily, the...

79
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,070
The killer...

80
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,030
The killer who killed the captive

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,909
was caught.

82
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,310
He is Gao.

83
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,830
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,150
The killer Master Gao mentioned,

85
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
since he has killed someone,

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,590
why would he turn himself in?

87
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,390
There are many doubts in this case.

88
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,550
It's definitely not as simple as

89
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,310
just the assassination of the princess.

90
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,950
I'm afraid there's a greater conspiracy behind it.

91
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,670
Master Gao should not close the case in haste.

92
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,830
Hope Your Majesty understanding.

93
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,070
He just turned himself in

94
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,550
this morning.

95
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,670
We haven't asked him about the situation.

96
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,950
Please give me some time.

97
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,910
I will investigate and find out the truth.

98
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,270
You simply get a person

99
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,870
and give a lame excuse.

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,670
Your position as the official of the Court of Judicial Review

101
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,510
is such a comfortable job.

102
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,110
I'll find out the truth,

103
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,750
and give Your Majesty,

104
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,470
and also the princess Yongchuan

105
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,630
an explanation.

106
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,270

107
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,230
the murderer was here for the informer.

108
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,030

Informers who entered the capital were killed.

No wonder...

114
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,830
since the first year of the Taicheng period,

115
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,660
it's been years since

116
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,430
I last saw any informers.

117
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,830
All have been killed.

118
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,990
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,350
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

120
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,990
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,270

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,030
The case of the informer,

131
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,590
are you able to find the truth?

132
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,750
Yes, I can.

133
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,110

whoever sees this behest,

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,310
must obey your orders.

140
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

141
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,350
With it,

142
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,950
no one can hold you back.

144
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,390
Find out the truth as soon as possible.

145
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,670
Give me an explanation.

147
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,430
Anything else?

148
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,190
I...

149
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,750
I'd like to request for an imperial edict.

150
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,140
Wu Siyue.

151
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,510
Don't think that

152
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,430
his majesty always spoils you,

153
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,790
so when you are in the court of officials,

154
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,070
you think you can go against the official of Court of Judicial Review

155
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,710
in front of so many people?

156
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,630
This time, the empress

157
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,710
didn't blame you.

158
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,490
[The Imperial Attendant of The Inner Guard: Wu Youjue]

159
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,030
It doesn't mean that in the future,

160
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,950
she won't find you guilty.

161
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,540
I know.

162
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,230
The empress told you alone to stay back.

163
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,270
Is there any assignment?

164
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,590
The empress told me to continue investigating

165
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,230
the death of the informer.

166
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,570
[Decree]

167
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,309
This is an extremely tricky case.

168
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,549
What are you going to do?

169
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,820
I'd like to go to the Court of Judicial Review,

170
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,950
bring back Gao Bingzhu, the suspect,

171
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,750
to the Inner Guards' Office for interrogation.

172
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,180
You just had a conflict with Master Gao.

173
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,470
Let Lu Zhi and the rest go

174
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,790
and bring him back for interrogation.

175
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,340
It should be fine.

176
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,990
Yes.

177
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,390
I, Baili Yan, together with my son, Baili Hongyi,

178
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,550
is here to pay homage to the ancestors.

179
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,630
The Baili family comes from a reputable lineage.

180
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,030
We have prospered for five generations.

181
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,270
Today, I am the Ministry of Works,

182
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,870
ranked among the famous families in the capital.

183
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,110
Blessed by the ancestors,

184
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,030
my son, Baili Hongyi,

185
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,030
is now a grown man.

186
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,060
He's about to get married, the continuation of the family name is something to look forward to.

187
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,750
And the construction of Heave Palace

188
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,990
will be completed.

189
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,740
I pray that all ancestors,

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,390
bless my son.
