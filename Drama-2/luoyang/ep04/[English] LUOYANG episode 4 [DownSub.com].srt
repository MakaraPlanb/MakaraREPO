00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,940
Raise your head.

195
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,530
Raise your head.

196
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,060

197
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,140
kneel down.

198
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,860
No, I didn't.

199
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,740
Raise your head.

200
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,450
Raise your head.

201
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,820
Why do you look at it for so long if you have never seen him?

202
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,210
He has a decent look,

203
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,730
of course I have to take a look.

204
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,540
Is Mr. Pei being jealous?

205
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,580
Do you want to take a look

206
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,500
at my room?

207
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,300
Raise your head.

208
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,850
Official Pei.

209
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,220
You lead me here,

210
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,290
I'm sure you do it on purpose.

211
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,860
We have many people outside,

212
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,420
do you think you can escape?

213
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,170
Who locks the Unwelcome Well?

214
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,100
There are continuous murder cases in the capital.

215
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,330
Three third-grade official died yesterday night.

216
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,140
Chief Minister Gao can't find you,

217
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,330
of course he has to vent his anger at the Unwelcome Well.

218
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,940
In the eyes of you officials,

219
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,220
people's lives are subordinate to the officials.

220
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,660
All this happened because of you.

221
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,700
If not you

222
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,780
who escaped from the Court of Judicial Review,

223
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,290
how could the Unwelcome Well be in trouble?

224
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,290
Let me be frank to you.

225
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,010
So long as you don't surrender yourself,

226
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,050
the Unwelcome Well

227
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,620
will not be unlocked.

228
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,460
Official Pei.

229
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,940
These few years, from the dead bodies,

230
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,540
I managed to find some clues for you.

231
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,930
For Liu Qi's case,

232
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,140
you said that you owed me a favour.

233
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,220
Do you remember?

234
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,900
You lead me here

235
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,300
just to tell me all these?

236
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,890
Please help me to take care of

237
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,820
the people from the Unwelcome Well.

238
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,140
Food and medical supplies,

239
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,420
please provide sufficient supplies for them.

240
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,460
In few days' time,

241
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,010
I will arrest the culprit

242
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,140
and send him to the Court of Judicial Review.

243
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,580
You're not the culprit.

244
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,380
In ten days' time,

245
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,220
if I didn't manage to arrest the culprit,

246
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,010
my head is yours.

247
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,300
Everyone knows that

248
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,460
Managing Clerk Pei from the Court of Judicial Review

249
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,740
is principled,

250
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,420
and never goes back on his words.

251
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,180
How could I believe in you?

252
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,930
The whole the Unwelcome Well

253
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,930
is under your control.

254
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,850
I will not take

255
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,860
their lives and risk them.

256
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,650
Goodbye, Official Pei.

257
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,580
Ten days?

258
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,930
Even the Court of Judicial Review

259
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,700
couldn't solve the problem,

260
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,140
you promised them for ten days?

261
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,330
That's a very cruel and dangerous criminal.

262
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,780
The Court has no way to deal with it.

263
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,370
What ways could you have?

264
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,050
You don't have to ask about my business.

265
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,860
It'll not be good for you.

266
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,660
Now that you're taking over this case,

267
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,890
if you

268
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,930
have been murdered by the criminal...

269
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,860
How do I deal with it?

270
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,970
You don't have to care.

271
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,260
I'm begging you.

272
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,740
You don't have to care about this.

273
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,420
I've put the Unwelcome Well in trouble,

274
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,220
of course I have to settle it.

275
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,220
Five years ago,

276
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,780
I was supposed to die

277
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,890
in their hands.

278
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,170
Why is that so?

279
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,860
I know...

280
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,730
we promised each other to not ask.

281
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,260
But it's been five years already,

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,580
you have never mentioned

283
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,650
what happened last time.

284
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,610
Now that you have rescued me again.

285
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,410
Thank you so much.

286
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm leaving.

287
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,570
You're trying to repudiate the debt.

288
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,020
Sir.

289
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,090

We work on the ships.

293
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,730
The most important thing is our credibility.

294
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Please give me a half day.

295
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,780
Wait until our master's funeral is over,

296
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,730
I'll go and ask for my salary.

297
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,740
Then together with interest,

298
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,300
I'll pay it to you.

299
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,050
A half day?

300
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,660
Which master?

301
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,660
Madam,

302
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,410
it's the Minister of Works, Master Baili.

303
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,020
If not because he was murdered in a sudden

304
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,860
yesterday night,

305
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,060
we would have

306
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,700
requested for the salary already.

307
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,660
What nonsense is that?

308
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,660
How could you fool me?

309
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,610
You blame a dead person.

310
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,060
You want me to ask for the debt from the king of hell?

311
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,970
As a gambler, I swear

312
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,490
there's nothing fake.

313
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,660
If you can't believe it,

314
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,940
then the goods from the Baili's mansion

315
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,740
are still on our ships.

316
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,140
I can pledge the goods to you.

317
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,740
You can't repudiate the debt,

318
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,890
so now you're trying to put it on credit.

319
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,410
Take them out and beat them.

320
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,290
Yes.

321
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:37,900

322
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,700

Close the coffin.

327

Wait for a moment.

328
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,650
Erlang, what happened?

329
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,260
What is this?

330
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,060
Perhaps the weather is too hot,

331
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,420
so these are the rashes.

332
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,020

Walk faster.

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,900
Those in front please move faster.

336
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,660
It's so slow.

When the Court of Judicial Review carried out autopsy,

348
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,690
they have never mentioned about rashes.

349
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,860
The wound was in the chest,

350
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,340
the blood would have splashed very high.

351
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,380
But the wall in father's study room

352
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,570
didn't have any blood stains.

Except if before he got stabbed,

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,090
the blood was already solidified.

and who killed your father?

362
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,180
You should investigate it on your own.

363

My father was not stabbed to death.

This is not corpse spots,

365
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,260
