00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,380
Anything?

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,340
I don't understand some family matters.

200

203
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,260
He will call in Uncle Wu

204

Bass is best for its fillet.

211
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,380
Making it soup is not good.

212
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,940
Then I'll have the kitchen make bass fillet.

213
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,900

If a man is burnt alive, there will be signs of struggle.

386
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
The corpse will be twisted.

387
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,460
From Huang An's corpse, it looks like

388
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,980
he was killed before.

389
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,060
Burning the body

390
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,540
is just to cover up the truth.

391
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,260
Sister-in-law!

392
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Sister-in-law!

393
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,660
My brother's death

394
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,020
is really not an accident?

395
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,460
I beg you to find out the truth.

396
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,500
I'll try my best.

397
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,290
I'll talk.

398
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,060
This is disrespectful

399
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,820
towards our dead brother.

400
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,900
That's right.

401
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,450
Let him do his job.

402
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,620
I'm just doing based on the signals given.

403
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,100
Where the signal is,

404
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,260
I'll deliver the copper there.

406
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,980
Then what about this token?

407
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,940
This is given by my boss

408
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,180
for the purpose of trading.

[A cosmetic shop from South City: Tulip oil from Persia]

410
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,140
What trading?

411
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,380
I haven't been informed.

412
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,210
What are you doing?

413
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,740
How dare you!

414
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,060
You are being disrespectful!

415
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,380
The casket is still here.

416
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,300
How can you do that?

417
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,260
My brother's soul will be

418
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,140
watching you from above.

419
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,060
You're insulting my brother.

420
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,940
What hair oil do you use?

421
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,300
This is a clue.

422
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,380
A cosmetic shop from South City.

423
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,700

00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,660
used to love these things.

427
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,620
My husband bought it for her.

428
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,900
Huang An has a concubine?

429
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,210
Where is she?

430
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,820
A few months ago,

431
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,340
my husband chased her away.

432
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,140
Why?

433
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,780
She was stealing something to eat,

434
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,340
and accidentally spilled a soup.

435
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,600
[Huang's mansion]

436
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,900
The tulip oil from Persia costs a fortune.

437
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,900
If Huang An is willing

438
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,540
to buy it for her,

439
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,300
why would he chase her out

440
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,100
just because of a bowl of soup?

441
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,980
What you're saying is

442
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
there must be something fishy here.

443
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,740
Did I say that?

444
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,140
Then what you said just now

445
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,020
means...

446
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,900
I need to check out the cosmetic shop.

447
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,620
Erlang...

448
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,540
It is getting dark.

449
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,100
By the time we get to South City,

450
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,250
it will be totally dark.

451
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,770
Then we will depart tomorrow morning.

Call me brother.

Brother.

456
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
I'm wrong.

457
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,100
You don't have to rush to apologize.

458
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,140
If not for the joint corps

459
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,300
calling out to Master Song who's nearby

460
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,220
and got there on time,

461
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,580
I won't be able to see you again.

462
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,900
It was an emergency.

463
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,340
I didn't have time to return and report.

464
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,090
Brother.

465
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,660
What happened to the workers last night?

466
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,180
Master Song has sent them

467
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,260
to the inner guards.

468
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,460
Did they find anything?

469
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,340
Go back quick.

470
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,940
Get changed and rest.

471
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,780
-Don't meddle in this matter anymore. 
-Brother.

472
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,820
They're all people

473
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,700
from Chuiliu Corporation.

474
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,300

they have been swapping the copper for years.

476
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,820
This case is defined as Baili Yan's corruption.

477
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,780
Case closed.

478
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,180
Brother.

479
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,580
Baili Yan is dead.

480
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,460
Why the corruption?

481
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,820
This matter is not that easy.

482
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,450
This has been decided.

483
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,620
Case closed.

484
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
I would like to ask you.

485
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,140
Who allowed you

486
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,540
to use the Empress' Behest as collateral

487
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,100
to guarantee Gao Bingzhu's innocence?

488
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:29,860
Brother.

489
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,700
Gao Bingzhu is innocent.

490
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,340
If he's dead,

491
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,220
the leads that I have

492
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,060
will be losing one.

493
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,740
He killed Lu Zhi and the other two inner guards.

494
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,900
Just because of this,

495
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,180
he's definitely not innocent.

496
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Master Baili's case

497
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,820
involved Chunqiu Divine.

498
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,380
He's just like me.

499
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,250
He simply wants to find out who's behind all this.

500
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,380
If this case is closed simply,

501
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm afraid...

502
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,020
Wu Siyue.

503
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,660
Mind your words.

504
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,260
Chunqiu Divine.

505
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,650
It's the empress' big taboo.

506
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,140
It's fine that you're mentioning it

507
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,500
here at my place.

508
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,420
If this news is spread,

509
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,370
it will be a huge issue.

510
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,700
If I can find the truth,

511
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,820
protect the capital,

512
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,820
so what if it becomes a huge issue?

513
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Who is this

514
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,940
Gao Bingzhu?

515
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,580
What drug did he give you?

516
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,580
From now on,

517
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,020
don't ever cross paths

518
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,220
with this man.

519
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,740
If I find out,

520
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,060
don't blame for being heartless.

521
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,140
Have you heard about the things in the palace?

522
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,250
Master.

523
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,860
Wu Youjue is trying to calm things down.

524
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,900
This case has been declared as

525
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,740
Baili Yan's corruption.

526
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,820
With such declaration,

527
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,180
the joint corps is innocently involved.

528
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,300
Not exactly innocently.

529
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,980
We did have our faults.

530
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,740
The empress holding us responsible is sensible.

531
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,540
It's just that…

532
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,860
I'm still worrying about that matter.

533
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,060
Whether it's the informer and his daughter being killed,

534
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,460
or the copper being swapped,

535
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,940
those people have a way

536
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,780
to avoid the joint corps' watching eyes.

537
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,980
What you mean is…

538
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,460
The joint corps

539
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,140
does have a spy.

540
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,060
I'm just doing based on the signals given.

541
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,260
Then what about this token?

542
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,420
This is given by my boss

543
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,540
for the purpose of trading.

544
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,500
Gao Bingzhu?

545
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,220
You're not dead?

546
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,580
I thought that night…

547
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,780
I've been looking for you.

548
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,340
Do you know?

549
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,660
You've been looking for me,

550
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,300
or you've been out scamming?

551
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
You heartless man.

552
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
I was even looking for you.

553
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,180
Fine. As long as you're not dead.

554
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,580
What are you doing with this wooden talisman?

555
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,540
You recognize this talisman?

556
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,020
Isn't this the talisman for trading

557
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,060
at the black market?

558
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,090
The black market?

559
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,620
Right. This is the one.

560
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,060
The black market

561
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,900
has a variety of expensive goods,

562
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,580
so their trade is done cautiously.

563
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,850
This wooden talisman is small and unique.

564
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,020
Even if it's found,

565
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,580
you can say it's an accessory.

566
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,740
The patterns on the talisman

567
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,780
looks like it's from the Chuiliu Corporation.

568
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,860
Chuiliu Corporation again.

569
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,100
Looks like I have to go there again.

570
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,500
You are a wanted man.

571
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't wander around, can you?

572
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,260
When you go alone,

573
