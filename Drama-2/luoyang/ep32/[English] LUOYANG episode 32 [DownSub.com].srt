Baili Hongyi even said our Services
can't be wholly trusted,

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,350
You can find a good husband...

194
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,350
You wanted to kill me from the start, right?

195
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,350
How did you know that?

196
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,630
You said you've been living here

197
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,670
with your father,

198
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,830
but when I asked you for water,

199
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,030
you didn't even know where the water tank was.

200
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,350
You are not familiar with this house.

201
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,670
Any water?

202
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,550
The herbs you're drying by the window
are called Atractylodes.

203
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,310
They are shade-loving plants.

204
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,710
A girl who picks herbs for a living

205
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,230
should know that for sure.

206
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,070
No wonder my senior, the 16th Night,

207
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,630
died at your hands.

208
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,310
You...

209
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,470
Tell me,

210
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,790
where is Four Season Palace?

211
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,470
Tell me where Four Season Palace is!

212
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,510
You'll be dead tonight.

213
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,230
Are you okay?

214
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,910
Yeah.

215
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,430
Are you crazy?

216
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,430
Follow me.

217
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:30,750
Run.

218
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,710
Run! Run!

219
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,590
Siyue,

220
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,510
did you stay up all night?

221
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,790
Brother, I'm fine.

222
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,300
[With Fortitude And Loyalty]

223
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,230
Li Beiqi took away the deployment map.

224
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,470
We need rearrangement.

225
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,750
Too many people and things are involved

226
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,790
in the Ceremony.

227
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,110
There isn't enough time.

228
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,310
All we can do now

229
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,830
is to check if we've neglected anything

230
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,750
and to deploy more people.

231
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,310
I will not let him have any chance.

232
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,270
Sir Wu,

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,870
someone from the Intelligence Services
 wants to see Madam Wu.

234
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:12,990
This way.

235
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,590
That way!

236
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,500
[Li Beiqi was last seen at Anyuan Freight]

237
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,310
Anyuan Freight?

238
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,990
When establishing the Intelligence Services,

239
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,750
Her Majesty stressed

240
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,510
that we can't meddle in the affairs
 of the Interior Guard Services.

241
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,990
But Li Beiqi can be related to Four Season Clan,

242
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,430
and the Ceremony of Light is being threatened.

243
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,550
So, Lord Chu has to make a compromise.

244
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,190
Madam Wu, I came here to remind you

245
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,070
not to tell others about this.

246
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,030
I know.

247
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,740
Right. If you'll excuse me.

248
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,030
Bingzhu,

249
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,230
your wound...

250
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,020
Why did you save me?

251
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,470
You knew I won't tell you anything.

252
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:15,910
In your eyes,

253
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,150
I should be of no use.

254
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,140
A surprise, huh?

255
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,710
You didn't expect

256
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,190
they would kill you, right?

257
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,750
I am from the Clan.

258
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,590
I'll die for the Clan.

259
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,030
It's worth it.

260
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,310
Your Clan

261
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,710
does not tolerate those who fail.

262
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,310
What's more,

263
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,150
you are in our hands.

264
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,910
Once you are of no use,

265
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,470
you will be killed.

266
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,070
The same goes for everyone.

267
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,830
The 16th Night was your senior, right?

268
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,470
She told me that

269
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,070
lives were of no value.

270
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,870
To achieve her goal,

271
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,310
she could kill as many as she wanted.

272
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,230
it doesn't matter

273
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,590
if you're noble, poor, good, or bad.

274
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,630
As long as you can stay alive,

275
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,270
and accomplish your mission,

276
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,710
you can kill

277
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,750
all you want.

278
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,550
But I think

279
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,750
we all have parents.

280
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,790
We are flesh and blood

281
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,430
and we have dignity.

282
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,910
Each life is precious.

283
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,670
I saved you

284
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,190
because you are

285
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,910
a living human being.

286
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,590
I must've done evil

287
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,470
in my previous life.

288
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,670
Every time I was with you,

289
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,590
I was so close to death.

290
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,790
But I am still with you.

291
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,110
Why is that?

292
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,350
Am I bewitched?

293
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,180
There are roses of Sharon on both ways.

294
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,950
Which should we take?

295
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,870
Someone's here.

296
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,710
Follow me.

297
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,270
My lord, let me fill your cup.

298
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,790
Here.

299
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,910
My lord, please enjoy.

300
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,950
The Noodles of Gourmets

301
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,670
are indeed the best in Luoyang.

302
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,830
I'm waiting for Peipei.

303
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,350
Which lady are you here for?

304
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,030
You're waiting for Peipei?

305
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:21,990
Yes.

306
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,830
I made a reservation half a month ago.

307
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,190
You can't meet Peipei.

308
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,070
What are you talking about?

309
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,470
Peipei is not your wife.

310
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,340
Why can't I meet her?

311
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,590
Because I said so!

312
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,310
Get out of here!

313
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,030
Let go!

314
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,590
Get out of here! Now!

315
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,830
Stop it!

316
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,910
I'm telling you to get out!

317
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,590
Stop!

318
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,380
My lord, calm down.

319
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,830
The guests are all watching.

320
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,430
I still have a business to run.

321
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,030
My lord,

322
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,990
Lady Peipei wants to see you.

323
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,510
Chunhe.

324
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,630
Chunhe.

325
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,030
You made a scene in Hong Xiao Fang,

326
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,550
but I didn't blame you.

327
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,470
Now, you've driven my guest away.

328
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,510
What on earth do you want, my lord?

329
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,380
I...

330
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,990
I was just trying to protect you.

331
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,830
Please leave then, my lord.

332
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,310
I'm not Chunhe anymore.

333
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,910
I don't need your protection.

334
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,910
At least you're willing to see me.

335
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,430
You admitted you are Chunhe.

336
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,350
It doesn't matter if you are Peipei or Chunhe,

337
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,550
in my mind,

338
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,660
you've never changed.

339
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,550
You keep talking about the past.

340
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,030
Men

341
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,070
are somewhat obsessed

342
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,750
with what they haven't got.

343
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,710
I suppose this is

344
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,150
how you feel about me.

345
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,350
I'll let you have me today.

346
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,230
Don't come again.

347
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,150
You've been away from Luoyang for years.

348
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,630
You probably don't know

349
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,430
I have known too many nobles in Luoyang.

350
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm not that Chunhe

351
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,350
everyone could bully anymore.

352
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,670
You don't deserve to be my guest,

353
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,190
but since we have a history,

354
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,660
let me pay you back today.

355
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,750
Chunhe,

356
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,030
how could you be like this?

357
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,470
It's all my fault!

358
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,910
I didn't protect you.

359
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,790
Chunhe.

360
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,670
No one can protect me.

361
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,710
I can.

362
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,470
How?

363
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,230
The Liu family has declined.

364
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,630
Do you think you can

365
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,830
control those nobles with your background?

366
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,590
Can you use your title

367
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,790
to keep ordering people around?

368
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,230
Chunhe.

369
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,270
Leave.

370
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,500
Hong Xiao Fang is not somewhere you should come.

371
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:27,990
Please

372
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,630
take today as my reciprocation.

373
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,030
This is the end of us.

374
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,350
If you dare to disturb my guest again,

375
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,030
I'll get you thrown out.

376
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,790
Do you mean I don't deserve

377
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,030
to get into Hong Xiao Fang, given who I am?

378
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,190
Chunhe.

379
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,350
Chunhe.

380
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,590
Chunhe.

381
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,910
Just go down from here.

382
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,470
From here?

383
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,550
Do you mean

384
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,590
Four Season Palace is down the mountains?

385
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,510
Yes.

386
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,030
The vine ladder will give you a shortcut,

387
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,270
but it can only bear

388
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,990
one person's weight.

389
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,550
Bingzhu,

390
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,030
are we going down from here?

391
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,110
Think about it.

392
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,190
If the girl

393
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,830
-is up to something...
 -I'll go down.

394
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,070
Go back.

395
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,750
I'm already here. Why...

396
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,350
I'll go down.

397
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,710
You...

398
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,230
Go back.

399
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,310
What if...

400
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,230
Go.

401
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:52,950
Okay.

402
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,870
Stay alive.

403
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,230
I know you won't believe me that easily.

404
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,270
If I go first,

405
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,590
I'll probably run away.

406
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,310
There can also be traps
down there waiting for you.

407
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,190
But if you go down first,

408
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,350
I will probably

409
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,340
cut the ladder up here.

410
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,710
So it's up to you

411
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,830
to go or not to.

412
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,550
Leave.

413
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,470
To Four Season Clan,

414
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,630
you're of no use.

415
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,510
If you go with me,

416
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,190
they will take your life.

417
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,910
If you leave now,

418
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,230
you can survive.

419
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,630
I won't survive now that I'm one of them.

420
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,710
No matter where I go,

421
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,430
they'll come after me.

422
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,110
I was raised by them, though.

423
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,310
So, my life only belongs to them.

424
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,070
Don't you have any families?

425
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,950
Actually, I know another girl

426
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,710
who even looked a bit like you.

427
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,950
But she has a different personality.

428
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,150
She laughed and cried a lot.

429
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,910
She was curious about everything.

430
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,380
My mother's Qiongguo candy was her favorite.

431
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,790
Have you tried Qiongguo candy?

432
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,390
I saved all the good stuff for her,

433
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,270
but she was too spoiled.

434
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,990
Once she was not satisfied,

435
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,430
she would cry and yell.

436
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,350
My mother always thought

437
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,230
I was bullying her.

438
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,870
If she is still alive,

439
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,990
she should be of your age.

440
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,630
Then where's the girl now?

441
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,070
She's gone missing.

442
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,660
I don't know where she is.

443
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,110
Bye.

444
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,390
Without me leading the way,

445
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,790
how are you going to get in?

446
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,070
I've had an idea.

447
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,110
Four Season Clan is making a big move

448
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,990
and may overlook you.

449
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,270
Leave now,

450
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,870

[Map of Luoyang]

452
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,910
Have you sealed the dry wells
in the south market?

453
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,670
Yes.

454
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,670
How about Tianjin Bridge?

455
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,550
Reinforced.

456
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,150
The Heavenly Temple...

457
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,590
The Heavenly Temple is the top priority.

458
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,270
Her Majesty will go there and light candles.

459
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,670
By then,

460
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,070
at least half of the interior guards
will guard there

461
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,230

Sir Wu.

464
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,470
Sir Wu.

465
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,310
You didn't sleep, did you?

466
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,950
We need to ensure
Her Majesty's safety at the Ceremony.

467
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,870
We can't drop our guard.

468
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,110
I've seen your work.

469
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,990
This is indeed more precise

470
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,990
than the previous deployment map.

471
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,230
It seems that

the Clan people.

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,550
I'm still worried that I might've 
overlooked something.

476
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,430
Even Homer sometimes nods.

477
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,700
I suggest you go back

478
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,510
and have a rest now.

479
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,510

How large is the blast area?

545
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,310
It depends on the weight.

572
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,990
They're not going to
attack so many places, are they?

573
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,870
No idea.

574
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,390
The Patriarch?

575
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,630
Is this Lord Freedom?

576
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,030
It's strange.

577
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,470

The rhyme is called Lianshan Rhyme.

582
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,070
I heard Lord of Spring and Lady of Autumn 
mention it.

583
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,470
The plan that the Clan has worked on for years
 hides in the rhyme.

584
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,950
Take me to Luoyang,

585
