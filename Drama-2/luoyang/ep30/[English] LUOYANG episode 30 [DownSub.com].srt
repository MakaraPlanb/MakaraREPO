1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,080
[Luoyang]

3
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,650
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,979
The Clan is making such

5
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,150
a powerful weapon.

6
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,830
What do you think

7
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,350
they are using it for?

8
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,479
For the Ceremony of Light.

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,229
The Ceremony of Light?

10
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,830
On the day of the Ceremony,

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,390
Her Majesty will kick off candle lighting

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,310
and gold painting for the statue of Buddha
at the Heavenly Temple.

13
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,310
If I were from the Clan, that would be

14
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,470
the best time

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,070
for me to take action.

16
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,139
Any evidence?

17
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,710
I need more time to look into it.

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,630
My lord,

19
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,670
please persuade Her Majesty

20
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,210
into canceling the Ceremony
before I can get evidence.

21
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,030
Cancel it?

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,750
Do you know how much

23
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,950
different departments and regions

24
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,430
have spent on and done for it

25
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,380
in the past 6 months?

26
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,270
You can't just cancel it.

27
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,800
Putting it off also works

28
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,030
if it can't be canceled.

29
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,020
Do you want it to be postponed

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,480
until you figure out the Clan's plan?

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,860
If you can't

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,700
find out their plan,

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,310
Her Majesty can never

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,230
hold the Ceremony, right?

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,350
This matters a lot.

36
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,070
We should prepare for the worst.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,510
The Clan already has

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,630
the formula of the Thunder.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,350
We can't afford the consequences

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,710
once they set it off at the Ceremony.

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,670
Our Services works to make our society safer.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,390
We've caught many villains

43
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,670
to protect Luoyang.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,190
We've never asked Her Majesty

45
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,190
to cancel any events.

46
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,310
Now you are saying

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,710
we have to cancel the Ceremony

48
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,270
because of a so-called 'weapon.'

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,270
It would be so humiliating for us

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,510
if people got to know it.

51
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,230
The Thunder is a weapon of mass destruction.

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,110
Once it's set off,

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,990
It will be devastating for Her Majesty

54
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,750
and people in Luoyang.

55
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,110
How could you still worry

56
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,150
about our reputation

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,460
at this critical moment?

58
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,390
Gao Bingzhu,

59
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,590
do you think

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,990
you are protecting Luoyang,

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,750
but we, as officials,

62
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,230
are always being

63
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,550
indecisive and timid?

64
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,829
Aren't you?

65
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,740
Gao,

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,790
mind your manners!

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,390
Baitan.

68
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,390
Sir.

69
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:43,829
Madam.

70
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,910
Careful.

71
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,430
Brother.

72
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,670
Brother.

73
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,870
Are you feeling worse?

74
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,030
I'm fine.

75
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,740
You're up.

76
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,480
Is your leg still hurting?

77
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,960
Luckily, your bones didn't get hurt.

78
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,390
Come on.

79
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,430
Have a seat.

80
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:05,950
Don't stand here.

81
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,390
Careful.

82
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,350
Madam.

83
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,910
Sit down.

84
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,510
Madam, Sir Wu searched for you

85
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,460
in mountains the whole night,

86
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,330
[Li Chun, Interior Guard]

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,400
so his illness recurred.

88
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,070
Shut up.

89
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,790
Why did you come over

90
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,110
right after you woke up?

91
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,030
You need more rest.

92
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,870
You are the one who needs more rest.

93
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,110
Her Majesty assigned our Services

94
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,250
to ensure the safety and security

95
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,710
at the Ceremony of Light.

96
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,070
We can't make any mistakes.

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,190
Now, there is a weapon

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,190
called the Thunder.

99
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,790
It's hard to tell what the Clan

100
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,430
will do with it in the future.

101
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,390
I can take the security job.

102
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,670
Siyue,

103
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,150
you nearly died

104
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,430
and I nearly lost you.

105
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,070
Your top priority now

106
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,950
should be your health.

107
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,110
You can't risk your life anymore.

108
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,670
Your illness recurred because of me.

109
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,790
I just want to share

110
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,000
some of your burdens.

111
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm fine.

112
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,390
Escort Madam Wu back to her room.

113
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,590
I'm not leaving.

114
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,650
I want to be with you for a while.

115
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,160
You weren't born in a royal family.

116
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,270
You don't understand

117
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,350
my discreetness in the Court.

118
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,070
I'm Lord Chu

119
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,070
and the King of East River now,

120
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,430
but I will be a prisoner

121
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,990
if I make one mistake.

122
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,030
I don't care

123
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,120
about being Lord Chu.

124
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,580
My worry is that our Services

125
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,430
would be controlled by evildoers.

126
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,710
If that happened, you wouldn't be able to
share your thoughts

127
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,520
with anyone in the Services.

128
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,230
I know you care

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,310
about people in Luoyang.

130
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm proud of you.

131
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,070
I will report to Her Majesty

132
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,230
about the Thunder

133
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,300
but I don't think she
will cancel the Ceremony

134
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,080
based on how much I know her.

135
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,470
What we should do now

136
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,030
is to stop the Clan's plan

137
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,190
as soon as possible.

138
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,990
They got copper from Mount Lian
and the Xuanwu's Pearl.

139
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,270
The Clan has been planning for a long time.

140
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,390
Their leader, Lord Freedom,

141
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,590
is kept in the dungeon
 in the Interior Guard Services.

142
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,909
I want to see him.

143
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,710
You should bring enough

144
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,230
people for this operation.

145
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,590
Make sure

146
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,920
to kill Baili Hongyi.

147
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,130
[Gong Yan, disciple of Four Season Clan]

148
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,150
Yes.

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,970
[Grave of Baili Kuanren, West Mountain]

150
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,830
My lord.

151
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,550
Hongyi.

152
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,190
My lord.

153
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,990
Hongyi.

154
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,220
My lord.

155
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,230
My lord!

156
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,550
Hongyi.

157
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,870
You...

158
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,310
What are you doing?

159
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,940
It's against the laws.

160
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,830
I know.

161
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,750
Hongyi!

162
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
No. Don't do it.

163
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,909
What?

164
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,470
Are you going to report me?

165
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,500
I...

166
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,230
I mean...

167
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,590
Your brother is buried here.

168
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,510
You will be punished by God

169
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,909
for digging his grave.

170
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,630
Uncle Baili.

171
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,350
You can't do it.

172
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,909
Uncle Baili.

173
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,590
No.

174
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,190
Uncle Baili.

175
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:54,950
Hongyi.

176
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,670
Uncle Baili, please.

177
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,350
Hongyi.

178
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,070
Hongyi,

179
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,750
are you sure about this?

180
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,910
Yes.

181
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,990
The cause of my brother's death is unknown.

182
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,950
His handwriting was found

183
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,830
at Tiantong's place.

184
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,270
I have to investigate it.

185
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,030
Hongyi.

186
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,280
Sir, a person from the Intelligence
Services wants to see you.

187
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,680
He is here for work.

188
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,230
Let him in.

189
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,070
Yes, sir.

190
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,660
I am Gao Bingzhu, the Halberdier
of the Intelligence Services.

191
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,710
Greetings, sir.

192
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,430
It's like you're asking for trouble.

193
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,750
Did you forget what I said

194
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,870
to you on the North Mountain?

195
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,510
Lord Chu sent me here.

196
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm not scared of him.

197
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,390
Siyue isn't here.

198
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,990
No one can protect you.

199
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,350
Guys!

200
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,830
Are you going to neglect

201
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,040
the security of the Ceremony of Light?

202
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,350
The Thunder

203
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,750
is a weapon of mass destruction.

204
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,510
You saw its power with your own eyes.

205
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,790
Can you afford

206
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,270
the consequences

207
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,630
if the Clan sets it off

208
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,510
at the Ceremony?

209
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,350
What are you here for?

210
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,150
I want to see Lord Freedom.

211
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,220
How come there are rocks inside?

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,550
My brother is still alive.

213
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,110
He was born with an extra finger

214
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,770
so he couldn't be an official.

215
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,510
[Baili Kuanren]

216
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,830
It upset him a lot.

217
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,270
He often read

218
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,470
grandfather's books.

219
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,860
My brother must know

220
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,430
the relationship
between my grandfather and the Clan.

221
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,370
He must also know that my grandfather
was studying witchcraft.

222
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,990
Everything will make sense

223
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,430
if he is still alive.

224
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,870
Bother,

225
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,670
learning to read and write

226
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,710
is not fun at all.

227
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,750
Can you play

228
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,790
with me for a while?

229
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,390
Didn't I give you the ring puzzle?

230
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,030
Have you worked it out?

231
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,590
It's so hard.

232
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,630
I tried my best, but still,

233
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,950
they're just separate iron rings.

234
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,430
I can't make a loop out of them.

235
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,350
If I had one more finger

236
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
like you,

237
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,140
I might have been able

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,350
to work it out.

239
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,950
I've told you a million times.

240
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,790
Do not mention my fingers.

241
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,700
You want to have that extra finger,

242
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,110
but you can't imagine

243
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,630
how much I want it to be chopped off.

244
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,510
Uncle Baili.

245
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:20,950
Leave.

246
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:37,950
My lord,

247
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,070
they might come back again.

248
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,710
We'd better leave.

249
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,550
Hongyi.

250
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,180
Let's restore the grave first.

251
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,880
[Lord Freedom,
Leader of Four Season Clan]

252
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,190
The 28th.

253
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,670
Congratulations.

254
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,630
Listen, weeds.

255
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,950
Moral ones

256
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,630
won't be hurt by fire or water.

257
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,260
They can survive cold and hot weather.

258
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,510
Beasts can't hurt them.

259
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,390
The person on the throne should be moral,

260
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,950
but the evil Empress is only a dim light.

261
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,150
She can't shine with the sun and the moon.

262
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,030
Weeds spread widely.

263
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,070
Fire burns them down.

264
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,070
These weeds

265
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,230
will be gone in the fire.

266
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,360
How to set them on fire?

267
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,830
Come.

268
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,350
Come here.

269
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,670
Come closer.

270
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,910
Come here.

271
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,670
Do you know who I am?

272
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,550
Lord Freedom.

273
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,350
Yes.

274
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,710
Were you sent by the Clan?

275
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,470
Look,

276
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,790
the Clan governs nature.

277
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,030
It burns down all weeds

278
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,060
and makes sure everything is in order.

279
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,270
Once you have fire...

280
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,310
And then?

281
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,680
♫The great rose of Sharon♫

I've told you.

286
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,230
He is a nut.

287
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,790
You're a nut.

288
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,270
You're both nuts.

289
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,870
Lord Freedom.

290
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,820
There're too many weeds in the world.

291
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,190
They can't all be burned down.

292
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,110
They can.

293
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,990
Lowly weeds grow in the wind.

294
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,110
They threaten valuable plants and trees.

295
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,510
They have to be set on fire

296
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,700
and burnt to dust.

297
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,790
In this way, everything

298
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,030
in nature can be in order.

299
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,310
Even so, weeds grow crazily.

300
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,110
They'll never stop

301
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,210
growing even if you

302
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,470
keep mowing them.

303
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,510
Unless you use

304
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,140
the Thunder.

305
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,790
Right.

306
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,750
Good idea.

307
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,790
The Thunder.

308
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,990
Where will the Thunder

309
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,950
be set off?

310
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,590
Luoyang.

311
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,710
Where in Luoyang?

312
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,350

and flourished to the River Gu and the sky.

339
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,589
Madam, why did you get up?

340
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,710
Is your leg okay?

341
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:08,710
I'm fine.

342
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,430
It's time for medicine.

343
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,670
I just took some.

344
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,530
Why do I need to take more?

345
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,910
The prescriptions are different.

346
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,829
The doctor asked me to bring this one

347
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,280
four hours after you had the last one.

348
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,710
Any news about Gao Bingzhu?

349
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,950
He just came

350
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,150
to our Services.

351
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,190
He came for work

352
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,490
on behalf of the Intelligence Services.

353
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,350
Sir Wu...

354
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,150
Madam.

355
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,030
Sir,

356
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,150
your work is done.

357
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,390
This way, please.

358
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,510
Thanks, Sir Li.

359
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,690
By the way, do you know

360
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,230
if Madam Wu is getting any better?

361
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,030
She is fine.

362
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,190
We will surely

363
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,190
take care of her.

364
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,070
Please.

365
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,070
Gao Bingzhu!

366
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,310
You can go.

367
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,270
Yes, madam.

368
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,510
Is your leg getting better?

369
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,760
Why didn't you come to see me now that you're here?

370
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,590
I needed to talk to Sir Wu

371
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,150
and

372
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,150
I will leave Luoyang for some time.

373
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,990
Did you find new clues

374
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,790
or did my brother

375
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,360
say something to you?

376
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm going with you.

377
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,470
My leg is fine.

378
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,510
At least you can have some company.

379
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:07,990
Siyue,

380
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,750
your top priority now

381
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,100
is to get recovered.

382
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,550
Luoyang needs you

383
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,830
at such a critical time.

384
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,470
You need to work with Sir Wu

385
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,790
to ensure the security of the Ceremony.

386
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,140
I'll come back as soon as I can.

387
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,750
Gao Bingzhu!

388
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,710
Do you remember

389
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,870
what you've said?

390
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,110
You told me to

391
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,390
stay alive

392
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,270
to find Tan

393
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,430
with you together

394
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,110
and save people

395
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,510
from the Unwelcome Well.

396
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,070
You also promised me

397
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,550
that you'd stay alive and enjoy

398
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,070
the beauty of Luoyang with me together.

399
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,270
Will you

400
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,830
keep your word?

401
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,580
♫In my memory♫

402
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:11,760
♫My colorful dream was lit up♫

403
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,110
I will, forever.

404
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,730
♫We said goodbye♫

405
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,470
♫I murmured that I'd never see you again♫

406
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,230
♫I'm waiting♫

407
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,010
♫Waiting to wake up from the dream♫

408
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,860
♫Wake up♫

409
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,570
♫Wake up♫

410
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,830
♫Stay♫

411
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,230
Madam.

412
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,470
What's up?

413
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,110
Sir Wu passed out.

414
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:02,870
Brother.

415
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,110
Brother.

416
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,190
Brother.

417
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,470
How is he?

418
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,590
Sir Wu's illness recurred,

419
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,310
and he has been overtaxing himself.

420
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,650
That's why he passed out.

421
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,990
Brother,

422
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,230
wake up.

423
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,710
I didn't listen to you.

424
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,720
You got sick because of me.

425
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,230
Brother,

426
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,070
I'm sorry.

427
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,790
I will

428
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,980
listen to you in the future.

429
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,470
Please wake up.

430
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,990
Don't forget

431
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,470
what you just said.

432
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,190
Brother.

433
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,470
Don't worry.

434
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm fine.

435
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,430
You scared me.

436
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,670
You scared me to death!

437
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,710
Don't worry, everyone.

438
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,150
Go back to your work.

439
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,430
Yes, sir.

440
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,750
How do you feel?

441
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,270
-I'm fine.
-It's good that you woke up, sir.

442
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,390
You just need to take medicine on time

443
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,330
and let your body recover slowly.

444
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,870
Also,

445
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,990
madam,

446
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,230
you should also

447
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,640
look after yourself.

448
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,550
Thanks, doctor.

449
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,230
Sir,

450
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,790
if you'll excuse me.

451
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,590
Don't cry, Siyue.

452
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,990
Go prepare some ink.

453
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,350
I need to draft reports.

454
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,510
You're in poor condition.

455
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,830
Can't you take a break?

456
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,430
The Ceremony of Light is approaching.

457
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,510
Her Majesty will be present.

458
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,870
We should be

459
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,430
very cautious.

460
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,430
Why didn't you rest in your room?

461
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,110
You shouldn't have come here.

462
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,070
I'm fine.

463
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,990
My injury isn't severe.

464
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,270
You, on the contrary,

465
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,310
should rest your mind.

466
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,070
How could I?

467
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,230
Her Majesty trusts our Services.

468
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,350
We should serve her with our lives.

469
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,310
Even if you don't care about your health,

470
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,470
think about the Services!

471
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,070
You're the backbone of the Services.

472
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,450
How could we serve Her Majesty

473
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,230
if you were too ill to work?

474
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,120
Just let me and Beiqi know

475
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,230
whatever you want to do.

476
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,590
We will do it for you.

477
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,510
We can report

478
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,990
everything to you.

479
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,510
Beiqi and I

480
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,950
grew up by your side.

481
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,270
You can surely

482
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,310
trust us.

483
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,790
I hope he can remember

484
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,390
why I slapped him.

485
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,590
Anyway,

486
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,070
if anything happens,

487
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,510
the two of you shall make a decision together

488
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,990
and let me know.

489
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,910
Do not

490
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,300
be impulsive.

491
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,550
There are two major issues in our Services.

492
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,750
First,

493
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,710
we should ensure that

494
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,750
the Ceremony takes place safely.

495
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,910
Second,

496
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,870
we can't underestimate the Thunder.

497
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,900
I'm afraid that

498
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,950
you can't handle it alone,

499
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,230
so I need to find someone to assist you.

500
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,270
Do you have a name in mind?

501
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,510
I'll let you know.

502
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,750
Uncle Baili,

503
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,350
you kept trying to stop me from opening the coffin.

504
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,350
Did you already know

505
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,190
my brother's body

506
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,590
isn't in it?

507
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,580
We nearly got killed by the assassin

508
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,150
when we were at my brother's grave.

509
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,390
It means that my brother

510
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,910
is probably related to a big conspiracy.

511
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,350
I'm so close to the truth now.

512
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,230
Uncle Baili,

513
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,710
are you still

514
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,750
not telling me the truth?

515
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,110
My lord,

516
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,710
I didn't mean to lie to you.

517
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,830
On the night when your brother died,

518
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,550
your father asked us to prepare the funeral

519
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,270
overnight

520
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,540
and bury your brother the next day.

521
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,470
Your father did everything from picking

522
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,350
the burial clothes to closing the coffin.

523
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,010
He didn't allow others to participate.

524
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,310
After your brother was buried,

525
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,430
he asked us

526
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,510
to vow

527
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,680
not to mention your brother in the Mansion.

528
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,270
People who gossiped

529
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,990
were laid off

530
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,670
by your father.

531
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,690
So,

532
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,110
my father did

533
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:09,990
everything by himself.

534
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,110
I don't really know any details,

535
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,870
but your father must have

536
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,110
kept it from others

537
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,550
for some reason.

538
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,270
That's why I tried to stop you.

539
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,500
[Baili Mansion]

540
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,230
I said something harsh to you

541
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,510
the last time I came here

542
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,750
because I was worried about Siyue.

543
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,790
Please pardon me.

544
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,270
It's fine,

545
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,780
as long as Madam Wu is alright.

546
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,790
Are you okay, sir?

547
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,990
I'll just cut to the chase.

548
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,750
You're aware that

549
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,390
Her Majesty assigned my Services

550
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,230
to ensure the security of the Ceremony.

551
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,390
It's important,

552
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,870
but as you can see,

553
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,230
my health

554
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,590
is getting worse.

555
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,670
Perhaps, I won't make it.

556
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,030
Siyue could have

557
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,110
helped me

558
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,390
but she got injured.

559
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,430
That's why I came to see you.

560
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,950
You two are friends.

561
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,310
I hope you can

562
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,070
work with our Services

563
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,430
to assist her.

564
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,710
The interior guards are all agile.

565
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,510
I am not as strong as them.

566
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,590
How can I do it?

567
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,870
Hongyi,

568
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,500
don't look down upon yourself.

569
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,670
I thought about it,

570
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,350
but I still think you are the best person to do it.

571
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:37,990
First,

572
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,150
you understand the power

573
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,590
of the Thunder.

574
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,630
Second,

575
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,110
and most importantly,

576
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,980
you know inside out about the buildings

577
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,540
and streets in Luoyang.

578
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,750
It helps us to foresee

579
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,070
the operations of the Clan.

580
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,390
It's good for security management at the Ceremony.

581
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,590
I'll think about it.

582
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,870
Sir,

583
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,350
I remember that

584
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,790
you studied with my brother.

585
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,030
I did.

586
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,190
Your brother, the King of Zhao,

587
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,430
and I

588
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,390
were students

589
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,030
of Fu Lyuping, the North Gate Scholar.

590
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,950
Why are you bringing this up?

591
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,190
Could you please tell me

592
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,240
the stories between you and my brother?

593
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,870
Back then,

594
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,910
the three of us were just teenagers.

595
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,510
We were of a similar age,

596
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,310
but our family backgrounds

597
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,430
were very different.

598
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,710
Still, it didn't prevent us

599
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,830
from being friends.

600
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,910
We used to

601
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,030
hang out all the time.

602
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,470
We played backgammon

603
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,550
and polo.

604
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,950
The King of Zhao

605
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,150
was very playful.

606
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,630
He often egged me and your brother on

607
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,510
to skip class

608
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,110
and play with him.

609
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,470
In the past,

610
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,030
we enjoyed puppetry

611
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,390
by the Tianjin Bridge.

612
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,730
We also watched entertainers from the West

613
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,190
performing fire breathing in the south market.

614
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,750
We experienced all of the novel and interesting things

615
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,230
in Luoyang.

616
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,790
However, we skipped too many classes

617
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,150
and our teacher finally found out.

618
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,790
He'd question us one by one.

619
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,740
Then, the three of us

620
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,230
would make up stories together.

621
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,510
Your brother

622
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,380
was very honest.

623
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,110
He couldn't lie at all.

624
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,070
He would blush every time

625
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,990
he was questioned

626
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,230
and ended up

627
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,780
telling the teacher

628
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,510
what really happened,

629
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,430
leaving nothing out.

630
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,590
Our teacher hit our hands
with a stick as a punishment.

631
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,830
Your brother was hit

632
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,990
the hardest.

633
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,670
His 11 fingers were swollen

634
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,430
and looked like bamboo shoots.

635
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,350
My hands looked like

636
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,070
stuffed buns while the hands

637
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,760
of the King of Zhao were like steamed buns.

638
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,830
We never felt any pain though.

639
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,590
We would just look at each other

640
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,230
and laugh for no reason.

641
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,190
That was the happiest

642
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,110
and the most relaxing time in my life.

643
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,990
Who'd have thought that

644
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,110
accidents can happen at any time?

645
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,070
Your brother passed away 10 years ago.

646
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,630
7 years ago,

Sir,

649
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,990
is it possible that

650
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,470
my brother is still alive?

651
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,590
You guys can leave.

652
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,710
Yes, sir.

653
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,350
Alive?

654
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,580
How could it be possible?

655
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,190
I checked his grave.

656
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,870
His body isn't in the coffin.

657
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,430
I've failed your brother's trust.

658
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,940
I've heard that grave robbery
is common in Luoyang

659
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,090
and there is a custom to arrange
marriages for the deceased.

660
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,090
I didn't expect criminals

661
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,030
to be so reckless.

662
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,260
They even dared

663
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,590
to rob a grave of the noble.

664
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,370

passed away.

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,500
but I remember that

668
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,230
you and your men came to the Mansion

669
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,830

was my close friend.

I wouldn't have recalled

674
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,910
my memory about him if you hadn't

675
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,750
brought it up.

676
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,780

he will be exiled
to the northwestern region

00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,950
and insulted Her Majesty.

766
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,350
Her Majesty

767
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,830
thought your brother was guilty.

768
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,470
He got the verdict,

769
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,060
and less than half a month later,

770
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,750
he died of illness at home.

771
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,910
Even so,

772
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,870
such a sudden death

773
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,830
sounds suspicious.

774
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,930
Where is the doctor who treated him?

775
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,990
I felt the same.

776
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,950
I asked the doctor,

777
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,430
but he told me that

778
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,550
everything looked normal.

779
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,790
He only said

780
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,820
Kuanren was depressed

781
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,070
and died

782
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,710
because of it.

783
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,590
The doctor has already passed away.

784
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,510
Madam.

785
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,870
Madam.

786
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,390
We can't find

787
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,500
the refugees' whereabouts.

788
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,590
The destinations they registered

789
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,310
are all fake addresses.

790
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,190
Fake addresses?

791
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,350
Inform the Grand Court

792
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,190
to help us

793
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,070
find the refugees.

794
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,790
Yes, madam.

795
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:56,910
Luoyang is huge.

796
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,710
They are like

797
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,150
a handful of salt spread
into the Yellow River.

798
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,950
It's impossible to find them.

799
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,980
Nevertheless, we have to find them.

800
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,470
Li Chun.

801
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,150
Yes.

802
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,820
Send more people to find Li Beiqi.

803
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,550
Make sure to take him back.

804
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,820
I want his explanation.

805
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,310
Madam,

806
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,790
If we find him and he

807
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,070
refuses to go with us,

808
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,750
should we arrest him or kill him?

809
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,790
Take him back here.

810
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,470
Yes, madam.

811
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,230
Kuanren

812
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,190
had an ambition.

813
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,190
If he hadn't had an extra finger,

814
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,830
he could've been an official

815
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,880
and made a difference.

816
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,550
Hongyi,

817
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,550
you're similar to your brother.

818
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,150
You are both persistent.

819
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,870
Now you knew

820
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,110
how Kuanren died.

821
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,510
You must hate the Court.

822
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,790
I won't force you to assist

823
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,630
the security job of the Ceremony

824
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,270
if you don't want to.

825
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,390
I'm in.

826
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,470
Do you really believe

827
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,630
what that crazy old man said?

828
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,070
People tend to be honest

829
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,310
when they are crazy.

830
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,870
Tell me

831
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,430
about the surroundings of the River Gu.

832
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,140
Do you know what the area is

833
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,630
and how big it is?

834
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,790
Even if the Clan is there,

835
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,070
it will take you,

836
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,430
the Grand Court,

837
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,520
and the Interior Guard Services

838
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,830
over months to search it.

839
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,190
Also,

840
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,310
there are many valleys, swamps,

00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,820
[River Jian, Luoyang, Mount Zhou]

842
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,310
and ancient trees by the River.

843
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,070
People easily get lost in it.

844
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,390
What's worse,

845
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,830
the area releases miasma.

846
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,710
It's poisonous.

847
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:39,870
The Clan

848
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,550
can't be there.

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,470
♫The great rose of Sharon♫

850
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,590

It grew by rivers

856
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,510
and flourished to the River Gu.

857
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,190
What does it mean?
