[Luoyang]

3
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,650
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,070
Let me tell you a joke.

5
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,070
There was a scholar

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,910
who really loved braised ox heads.

7
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,420
He could finish a whole head in one sitting.

8
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,630
One day,

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,110
he had a dream.

10
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,150
In this dream, he was dead.

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,510
An officer from the Underworld

12
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,310
came to bring him back.

13
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,710
Seeing the officer,

14
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,630
the scholar

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,790
wasn't afraid at all.

16
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,870
He even smiled at him.

17
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,230
Do you know why?

18
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,590
Because...

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,190
Because...

20
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,190
Because the officer who came was the Ox-head.

21
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,110
Have you heard of this?

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,270
I heard this joke

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,670
when I was seven or eight.

24
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,020
Aren't you too old-fashioned?

25
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,910
I have another one.

26
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,430
A tiger was living

27
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,470
in the forest.

28
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,510
It often...

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,430
Gao Bingzhu,

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,870
I know you're afraid that I'd sleep

31
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,790
and never wake up.

32
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,350
Don't worry.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,350
I won't give up.

34
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,950
I trust you.

35
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,030
I know you can.

36
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,120
Should we chat for a while?

37
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,110
You see,

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
I've always been curious about

39
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,030
how you became an interior guard

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,150
as a woman.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,590
My brother is the leader of the Services.

42
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,470
All I needed

43
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,670
was his approval.

44
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,630
Siyue,

45
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,830
show some mercy.

46
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,510
You can't even win a fight

47
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,550
against a woman!

48
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,909
How do you protect Luoyang

49
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,310
and Her Majesty?

50
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,510
Practice more!

51
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,670
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,630
From this moment,

53
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,190
Wu Siyue will officially become an interior guard.

54
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,550
Address her

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
as 'Madam.'

56
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,070
Madam!

57
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,310
I almost hit Madam Wu

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,710
during the combat.

59
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,550
Madam.

60
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,880
Luckily, I was quick on my feet.

61
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,510
I pretended to be attacked and fell,

62
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,670
or Sir Wu must punish me

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,470
for hurting her.

64
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,470
What Madam?

65
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,670
She is just a woman.

66
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,990
If Sir Wu hadn't asked us

67
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,750
to go easy on her,

68
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,950
I would've defeated her ten times!

69
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,470
Enough.

70
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,500
She is the sister of Sir Wu.

71
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,870
She joined the Services

72
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,230
just for fun.

73
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,830
Indeed.

74
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,230
I did ask them to go easy on you.

75
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,270
Siyue,

76
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,990
since you were little,

77
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,510
I've been giving you whatever you want.

78
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,990
No matter what you did,

79
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,420
I always supported you,

80
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,350
made sure you enjoyed what you did,

81
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,430
and had fun.

82
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,620
However, you need to know

83
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,350
that you're only a woman,

84
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,630
a grown-up woman.

85
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,990
One day,

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,300
you'll become a wife and a mother.

87
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,190
You can't put yourself

88
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,750
in danger every day!

89
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,310
If Beiqi competes with you seriously,

90
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,540
you won't have a chance.

91
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,350
How dare you!

92
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,870
Are you happy now?

93
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,230
I'm not as good as them.

94
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,150
I won't complain.

95
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,590
Next time,

96
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,270
we'll have serious combat.

97
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,070
So, you were angry

98
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,670
because they didn't

99
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,270
take you seriously.

100
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,710
I was angry 'cause they were right.

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,390
I joined the Services

102
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,350
just for fun.

103
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,910
If I hadn't heard what they said,

104
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,070
I would have quit several days later

105
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,870
and returned to my old life

106
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,950
as a noblewoman.

107
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,710
I would have

108
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,470
learned the Four Arts

109
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,390
together with the princess and Liu Ran,

110
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,990
met someone

111
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,510
who came from a similar family

112
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,750
and married him.

113
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,860
Neither my brother nor I

114
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,830
would've thought that

115
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,910
I am still an interior guard to this very day.

116
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,950
Siyue?

117
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,870
Siyue!

118
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,070
Siyue!

119
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,310
Siyue!

120
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,350
Wake up!

121
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,270
Siyue!

122
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,870
Don't sleep!

123
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,190
Stay with me!

124
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,590
Don't sleep!

125
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,590
Li Beiqi and his men are on their way.

126
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,990
They'll be here soon!

127
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,590
Hang in there!

128
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,550
Madam!

129
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,110
Madam!

130
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,710
Madam!

131
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,630
Madam!

132
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
Madam!

133
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,030
Madam!

134
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,350
Madam!

135
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,030
Madam!

136
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,549
Madam!

137
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,270
Madam!

138
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,630
Siyue!

139
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,789
Madam!

140
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,270
Sir!

141
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,630
Madam!

142
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,550
Tell everyone to raise their voices!

143
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,790
Raise your voices!

144
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,150
Madam!

145
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,110
Siyue!

146
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,470
Madam!

147
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,550
-Siyue!
-Madam!

148
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,470
Siyue,

149
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,870
Sir Wu is your brother.

150
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,350
He will save you

151
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,190
at all costs.

152
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,350
Brother?

153
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,030
Yes.

154
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,430
Find the place that collapsed
during the explosion.

155
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,830
Find the place that collapsed
during the explosion!

156
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,870
Madam!

157
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,390
Madam!

158
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,270
Siyue, look at me.

159
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,310
Look at me.

160
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,420
Look at me.

161
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,670
I am awake.

162
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,710
I'm just tired.

163
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,430
Do you...

164
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,110
Do you know that

165
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,510
I have a younger sister?

166
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
We haven't met

167
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,750
for so long.

168
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,750
Her name is...

169
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,150
Siyue?

170
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,950
Her name is Tan.

171
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,090
[Gao Tan]

172
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,510
Tan, are you hungry?

173
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,510
Have some congee.

174
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,190
Bingzhu,

175
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,230
mother said that

176
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,390
we can't eat until she's back.

177
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,350
Never mind.

178
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,270
I'll add some water to the congee.

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,550
She won't find out.

180
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,870
It's hot!

181
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,270
How dare you snaffle the congee?

182
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,030
Dare you do it again?

183
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,670
Mother, let go of me!

184
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,230
How can you...

185
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,150
Come back! Where are you going?

186
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,670
Mother!

187
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,350
Don't you run!

188
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,230
Stop!

189
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,510
-Stop!
-Mother!

190
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,350
Stop!

191
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,230
Mother!

192
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,190
Mother!

193
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,390
Mother!

194
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,230
Are you alright?

195
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,790
How dare you run away!

196
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Hare dare you!

197
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,670
Mother, I'm sorry.

198
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,860
Mother, I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,750
How dare you!

200
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,670
You're sorry?

201
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,860
Sorry for what?

202
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,270
I'm sorry for

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,670
eating without your permission.

204
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,350
You're hungry.

205
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,990
You can have congee.

206
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,070
You should be sorry for
not feeding Tan first.

207
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,870
Your father died.

208
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,190
You're the man of the house now.

209
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,670
Remember,

210
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,390
if there is only

211
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,820
one bite of bread left,

212
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,500
you have to let Tan eat first.

213
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,070
Remember, she is your sister!

214
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,390
Mother,

215
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,870
I see.

[Medicine]

217
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,790
Go.

218
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,110
Just leave.

219
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,860
We don't accept patients with no money.

220
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,590
Please save my sister!

221
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,670
I will pay you later.

222
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,550
Please save my sister.

223
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,500
Kowtow doesn't help.

224
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,430
Bingzhu,

225
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,390
I'm not sick.

226
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,630
Let's go home.

227
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,390
It's alright, Tan.

228
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,910
Leave now.

229
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,390
Please, save my sister!

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,070
I promise.

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,310
I'll pay you in the future.

232
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:32,830
Let go.

233
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,470
I'll do anything.

234
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,550
Stop pulling my shirt!

235
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,430
Let me tell you!

236
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,390
Nobody can save her life
if you don't have money!

237
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,550
Please save her!

238
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,030
Let go!

239
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,190
Let go!

240
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,830
Bingzhu!

241
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,150
Mr. Unsightly.

242
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,630
Why did you give these kids a hard time?

243
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,800
[Medicine]

244
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,950
Come here.

245
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,150
I'll pay for her treatment.

246
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,510
Please save her.

247
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,470
Thank you, Mr. Unsightly!

248
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,910
Get up!

249
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,780
Remember,

250
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,950
don't perform kowtow to anyone

251
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,910
apart from your parents.

252
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,190
Let's go.

253
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,510
Tan

254
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,040
is seven years younger than me.

255
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,550
When I was exiled
from the Unwelcome Well 5 years ago,

256
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,470
she went missing.

257
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,100
We never met

258
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,270
anymore.

259
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,910
Mother,

260
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,590
we searched

261
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,430
the whole Well,

262
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,710
we didn't find Tan.

263
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,270
Mrs. Gao!

264
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,070
Tan!

265
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,550
Mrs. Gao!

266
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,470
My daughter!

267
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,990
Mrs. Gao, calm down.

268
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,510
Mrs. Gao!

269
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,350
Take care, Mrs. Gao.

270
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,990
Listen to me.

271
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,630
I'll find her, Mrs. Gao.

272
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:53,870
Mrs. Gao!

273
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,310
Please take care of yourself!

274
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,830
I'm begging you, Mrs. Gao!

275
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,550
My daughter!

276
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,790
Please don't be like this!

277
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,870
My daughter!

278
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,950
We will find her!

279
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,950
Mrs. Gao!

280
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,270
Gao Bingzhu,

281
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,630
I'm cold.

282
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,430
So cold.

283
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,950
It's cold in this cave.

284
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,670
Let me warm you up.

285
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,070
Gao Bingzhu.

286
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,070
What?

287
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,110
Don't worry!

288
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,310
I'll hang in there until we get out.

289
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,220
You need to save your strength.

290
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,550
I will.

291
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,950
Siyue.

292
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,630
Madam!

293
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,310
Siyue!

294
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,390
Madam!

295
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,750
Siyue!

296
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,790
Madam!

297
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,430
Sir,

298
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,990
The North Mountain is so big.

299
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,430
Even the hounds

300
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,150
can't locate them.

301
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,790
Find all the hounds

302
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,350
in Luoyang then!

303
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,870
Yes!

304
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,350
Sir,

305
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,830
it's cold on the mountain.

306
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,430
Please

307
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,150
take care.

308
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,630
Why not go back and have a rest?

309
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,630
We'll stay here.

310
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,230
Madam!

311
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,070
Madam!

312
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,430
Madam!

313
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,390
Madam!

314
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,470
Li Beiqi,

315
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,910
on the first day she joined the Services,

316
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,270
I reminded you

317
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,830
that her safety

318
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,910
should be your top priority.

319
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,310
What did you tell me?

320
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,950
I could give up my life

321
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,710
to ensure her safety.

322
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,030
Did you keep your promise?

323
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,550
I deserve to die!

324
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,310
Li Beiqi,

325
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,990
I only have one sister.

326
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,310
If anything happens to her,

327
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,950
I won't forgive you even you die!

328
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,510
How about

329
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,950
you tell me

330
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,150
what you'll do

331
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,470
after we get out?

332
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,550
Siyue,

333
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,910
after I get out, I want to find Tan.

334
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,990
Come with me, and let's find her together.

335
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,870
What do you say?

336
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,940
I want to look after her.

337
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,980
I want

338
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,910
all people in the Unwelcome Well

339
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,030
to come out,

340
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,550
to be here in Luoyang,

341
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,630
to live in the sunshine

342
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,910
without hiding themselves again.

343
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,550
Siyue, did you hear me?

344
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,910
I want...

345
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,470
I want to go to the south market of Luoyang with you.

346
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,470
Siyue?

347
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,190
We can stand on that bridge

348
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,990
and watch those festival lanterns.

349
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,310
It was the first time

350
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,070
that you made me realize

351
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,110
how beautiful the city is.

352
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,790
I saw the lights in every family.

353
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,870
I saw

354
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,230
so many happy faces.

355
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,790
Siyue,

356
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,310
do you remember the south market that day?

357
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,270
It was amazing!

358
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,990
The lanterns in Luoyang

359
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,270
were amazing.

360
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,200
It was at that moment

361
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,580
that I found the meaning of my life.

362
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,109
So, I decided

363
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,790
to protect Luoyang as you do.

364
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,190
Siyue?

365
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,470
Siyue?

366
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,990
Did you hear me?

367
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,589
Sir!

368
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,670
We found traces of the collapse.
It's not far ahead.

369
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,710
Show me the way!

370
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,350
Yes!

371
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,270
Don't mind me!

372
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,630
Go find her!

373
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,430
Yes!

374
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,190
Hurry!

375
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,630
Move!

376
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,070
Hongyi,

377
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,710
it's quite early. Where are you going?

378
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,510
Sir Wu told me himself

379
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,390
that Gao Bingzhu and Madam Wu

380
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,790
got stuck in the North Mountain.

381
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,510
I can't calm down right now.

382
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,910
I need to go check some clues.

383
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,190
Siyue and Gao Bingzhu

384
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,430
were stuck in the mountain?

385
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,030
How did it happen?

386
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,750
What can I do?

387
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,110
Sir Wu and his men

388
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,280
are in the North Mountain.

389
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,750
Stay here and wait for my news.

390
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,190
Hongyi,

391
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,990
we were just out of the woods.

392
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,190
If you leave home now,

393
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,790
I'm afraid...

394
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,540
Don't worry.

395
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,510
I'm going to Hong Ru Guan

396
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
to meet the master.

397
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,550
I won't be in danger.

398
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,580
Wait for me.

399
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,070
Hongyi!

400
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,030
Please be careful!

401
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,710
Hurry!

402
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,310
Hurry!

403
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,550
Hurry!

404
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,390
Bring them out!

405
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
Siyue!

406
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,750
Hurry!

407
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,590
Hurry!

408
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,220
Hurry!

409
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,950
Hurry!

410
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,070
Hurry!

411
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,910
Hurry!

412
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,230
Go on!

413
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,670
Hurry!

414
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,670
Everyone, move!

415
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,430
Hurry!

416
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,990
Sir, the collapse is quite serious.

417
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,830
Without others' help,

418
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,550
I'm afraid...

419
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,150
Go.

420
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,550
Hurry!

421
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,070
Bring people of the Grand Court

422
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,150
and the Palace Guard!

423
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,150
Go!

424
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,430
Now!

425
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,350
Deeper!

426
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,750
Yes!

427
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,380
Attention, everyone!

428
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,150
Siyue needs to come out alive today!

429
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,270
Or...

430
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,550
everyone dies with her!

431
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,870
Gao Bingzhu,

432
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,950
if I could live longer,

433
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,030
we can

434
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,070
look for Tan

435
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,420
and watch...

436
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,710
watch festival lanterns.

437
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,110
Stay with me.

438
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,150
I want...

439
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,910
I want...

440
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,150
I want...

441
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,750
Siyue?

442
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,350
Siyue?

443
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,100
Stay with me.

444
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,140
Siyue?

445
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,550
Siyue?

446
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,710
Siyue?

447
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,470
Siyue.

448
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,630
Pull!

449
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,350
Harder!

450
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,030
Pull!

451
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,910
Pull harder, everyone!

452
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,550
Harder!

453
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,950
Harder!

454
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,230
Pull!

455
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,230
Madam!

456
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,910
Siyue!

457
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,550
Madam!

458
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,390
Siyue!

459
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,870
Siyue!

460
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,310
Siyue!

461
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,030
Madam!

462
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,270
Siyue!

463
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,390
Madam!

464
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,790
Madam!

465
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,710
We're here!

466
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,070
We're here!

467
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,990
Doctor!

468
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,030
Doctor!

469
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,790
Siyue!

470
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,430
Siyue!

471
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:33,990
Siyue!

472
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,420
Siyue!

473
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,070
Gao Bingzhu!

474
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,670
Let go of me!

475
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,870
You only bring bad luck!

476
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,350
If not for you,

477
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,390
Siyue wouldn't be

478
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,510
like this!

479
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,510
Siyue!

480
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,310
Siyue!

481
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,630
Don't speak!

482
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,110
-Don't hurt him!
-Don't speak.

483
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,070
Don't speak.

484
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,630
Siyue.

485
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,230
Hurry!

486
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,630
Take her back!

487
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,470
Hurry!

488
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,150
Careful.

489
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,870
Careful!

490
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,590
Move!

491
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
I promised her I won't kill you,

492
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,030
but if I ever see you again,

493
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,630
I'll let you

494
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,900
and people from the Well

495
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,510
know what hell looks like!

496
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,590
Bring Sir Wu back!

497
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,550
Move!

498
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,910
Thanks for seeing me.

499
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
I made friends

500
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,310
with your grandfather.

501
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,670
However, I've been staying away
from the outside world

502
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,150
for several decades.

503
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,590
If you were not his grandson,

504
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,900
I wouldn't see you.

505
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,310
My grandfather mentioned you

506
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,150
many times.

507
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,070
He admired you so much.

508
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,830
I have one thing that I don't understand.

509
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,110
That's why I'm here.

510
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,070
Mountains overlook the crowd?

511
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,910
I seemed to have read them before.

512
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,430
Where did you get this?

513
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,790
I accidentally found it

514
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,830
in my brother's room.

515
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,670
I remember that

516
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,990
scholars in Four Season Academy

517
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,950
seemed to be working on these
many years ago.

518
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,670
Four Season Academy?

519
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,710
Young people probably don't know it.

520
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,950
There was a place

521
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,710
called Four Season Academy in Chang'an.

522
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,590
In the first year of Chunxi,

523
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,070
Yu, the former Crown Prince,

524
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,590
admired the Jixia Academy
in the Warring States Period.

525
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,190
So, he found an auspicious site

526
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,270
in the countryside of Chang'an

527
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,710
and built Four Season Academy,

528
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,710
hoping for more scholars to come.

529
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,350
After he died,

530
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,390
Four Season Academy

531
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,270
changed its name to North Sea Academy.

532
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,950
Several years later,

533
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,350
North Sea Academy also disappeared.

534
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,510
Did the Academy

535
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,270
have something to do
with Four Season Clan?

536
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,590
Four Season Clan?

537
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,190
What is that?

538
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,420
It reminds me that your grandfather,

539
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,910
Baili Hu, used to teach
in North Sea Academy.

540
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,810
[Cultivation and Reading
are Family Heirlooms]

541
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,630
My lord, my lady,

542
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,430
what you are seeing right now

543
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,510
is only half powerful as the Thunder.

544
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,390
Thunder crashes and the world falls apart!

545
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,950
I can't believe

546
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,350
Tiantong did succeed!

547
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,030
Such a smart man!

548
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,830
You've been working on this for years

549
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,270
and ended up with nothing,

550
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,430
but after I threatened

551
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,230
to cut off your fingers,

552
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,430
you immediately succeeded!

553
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,550
Were you not

554
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,670
doing your best before?

555
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,750
Please trust me, my lady.

556
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,190
How could I lie down on my job?

557
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,070
Tiantong,

558
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,350
where did you get

559
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,910
this amazing formula?

560
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,390
Tell us.

561
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,150
I don't have a formula,

562
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,230
but I got help from others.

563
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,390
Others?

564
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,350
Bai...

565
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,430
Baili Hongyi.

566
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,750
Baili Hongyi?

567
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,830
You know who he is, right?

568
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,590
How could he help you?

569
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,950
I abducted him.

570
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,150
He didn't have a choice.

571
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,430
What a smart man!

572
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,830
Is this Baili Hongyi

573
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,470
still alive?

574
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,350
I promise, my lady.

575
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,150
I'll do everything I can

576
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,950
to kill him.

577
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,510
My lord,

578
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,070
Tiantong works for you.

579
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,710
He made such a great contribution.

580
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,550
Why are you not happy about it?

581
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,030
Now that the Interior Guard Services is involved,

582
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,230
we can't waste our time now.

583
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,510
Make sure

584
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,870
we can make the perfect Thunder.

585
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,470
Get all the Thunders ready

586
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,870
before the big day.

587
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:26,940
My lord,

588
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,310
news from the Services!

589
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,710
Sir Wu, together with all his men,

590
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,550
saved Madam Wu

591
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,230
from a collapsed cave

592
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,230
in the North Mountain.

593
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,350
A doctor is treating her now.

594
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,590
What about Gao Bingzhu?

595
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,870
Not sure.

596
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,350
He was not

597
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,350
with them.

598
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,230
By the way,

599
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,150
when I asked about him,

600
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,790
they almost started a fight with me.

601
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,230
He should be alright

602
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,670
considering what you said.

603
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,270
What worries me the most

604
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,190
is another thing.

605
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,350
What thing?

606
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,310
My lord, where are you going?

607
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,910
Home.

608
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,660
[Baili Mansion]

609
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,350
This is something we never mention.

610
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,910
Master Baili Hu never let me talk about it.

611
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,750
He was exiled from Four Season Academy

612
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,750
because of argument.

613
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,510
After he left,

614
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,870
horrible rumors were going around.

615
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,270
No one in the family

616
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,770
wanted him to be mistreated like this.

617
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,390
So, the Baili family

618
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,590
left Chang'an

619
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,910
and moved to Luoyang.

620
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,790
Why did they argue?

621
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,460
I have no idea

622
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,830
what happened.

623
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,750
You mentioned that

624
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,550
there were

625
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,550
horrible rumors about him.

626
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,030
What rumors?

627
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,590
They said he performed witchcraft.

628
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,870
However,

629
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,550
it reminds me that

630
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,380
there was a time

631
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,710
when the mansion was full of smoke

632
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,750
and pungent smell

633
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,770
like what happened when you made elixirs.

634
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,550
That's why people said

635
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,350
he knew witchcraft.

636
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,430
When did that happen?

637
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,070
One year before we came to Luoyang.

638
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,720
The 3rd year of Zhenlong.

639
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,790
My lord!

640
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,550
My lord!

641
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,390
Uncle Baili.

642
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,230
My lord,

643
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,750
Gao Bingzhu is here.

644
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,590
As you said,

645
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,790
those copper boxes

646
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,910
were full of imperfect Thunders.

647
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,510
That's what

648
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,310
Taoist Tiantong said.

649
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,550
The proportion is correct.

650
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,950
This sword is heavy.

651
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,550
It's made of copper from Mount Lian.

652
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,110
It turns out that

653
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,390
this is what the cooper is used for.

654
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,190
[Guanglin Inn]

655
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,670
I've always thought

656
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,830
that Four Season Clan

657
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,980
is making some elixirs.

658
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,630
While I was testing

659
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,950
Tiantong's manuscript,

660
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,030
I tried all the ingredients, formulas,

661
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,710
and all types of woods

662
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,270
to make sure the elixirs were perfect.

663
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,720
I took those small explosions

664
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,110
as failures.

665
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,470
Now I see,

666
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,750
that's what they're aiming for.

667
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,230
They don't want to

668
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,110
remove the toxicity of elixirs.

669
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,470
They want Thunder, the explosive!

670
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,070
They stole from those copper mines

671
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,670
not to make fake coins

672
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,350
or weapons,

673
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,230
but to make copper boxes.

674
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,740
This type of copper has great hardness.

675
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,510
Once a Thunder explodes inside,

676
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,670
the shattered pieces

677
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,190
will largely increase

678
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,830
the explosion's radius and damage.

679
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,510
What we saw

680
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,830
was only an imperfect product.

681
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,110
It already caused a landslide.

682
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,230
If they succeed,

683
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,860
its damage will be beyond imagination.

684
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,070
I think they've already succeeded by now.

685
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,860
Before you came here,

686
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,190
I was forced to test the formula,

687
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,750
but while I was doing so,

688
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,550
they found out the secret.

689
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,310
I thought

690
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,710
I could use frozen Xuanwu's Pearl

691
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,550
to lower the temperature and buy more time.

692
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,990
I didn't realize that it was this idea

693
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,410
that helped the furnace 
to reach the right temperature.

694
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,950
That's the key to success.

695
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,110
Using this method,

696
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,150
they won't have

697
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,530
useless ashes,

698
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,190
but Thunders that can be set off

699
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,310
at any time.

700
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,710
Do you mean

701
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,910
you helped them

702
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,230
solve the key issue

703
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,550
of making the Thunder?

704
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,710
Don't mention this to anyone.

705
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,240
I have to report to
the Intelligence Services.

706
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,950
Gao Bingzhu,

707
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,510
I didn't do it

708
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,190
intentionally,

709
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,790
but this was my fault.

710
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,230
I'll take full responsibility

711
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,670
for what I did.

712
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,950
You were in danger.

713
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,910
It was an accident.

714
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,070
It wasn't your fault.

715
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,780
Without you,

716
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,070
they would still

717
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,990
succeed.

718
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,390
You're the victim.

719
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,510
Don't blame yourself

720
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,590
for everything.

721
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,950
Instead of

722
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,910
blaming yourself,

723
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,670
why not think of ways to fix it?

724
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,350
It's my fault.

725
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,110
I got carried away

726
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,470
and told others about the manuscript,

727
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,230
putting you and Hongyi

728
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,990
in extreme danger.

729
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,790
Father,

730
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,590
we're alright now.

731
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,230
We returned home safely.

732
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,070
If anything had happened to you two...

733
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,830
It's all my fault!

734
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,710
Father,

735
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,550
don't blame yourself.

736
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,550
Taoist Tiantong is devious and cunning.

737
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,960
Even if you hadn't mentioned it,

738
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,390
he would have found us.

739
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,110
Father,

740
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,150
have you met Liu Feng recently?

741
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,070
How is he doing?

742
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,050
I'm afraid we will argue with each other
once we meet.

743
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,430
I ask someone to go to

744
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,110
Hong Xiao Fang to inquire about him.

745
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,950
He was kicked out

746
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,870
after he spent all his money.

747
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,990
Liu Feng is stubborn.

748
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,670
He was humiliated like this.

749
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,660
I wonder if he can get over it.

750
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,270
I don't want him to sleep on the streets.

751
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,270
I already sent people to find him.

752
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,550
I finally realized that

753
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,110
I should be blamed

754
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,750
for everything that has ever happened.

755
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,070
Father!

756
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,910
I will never

757
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,230
poke my nose

758
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,390
into anything he does.

759
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,110
He can marry whoever he likes

760
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,070
and do whatever he wants.

761
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,230
All I wish for is that

762
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,310
Hongyi and you can be safe and sound.

763
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,590
Father.

764
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,190
My lady!

765
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,390
My lady!

766
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,870
Uncle Baili, what happened?

767
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,230
Lord Hongyi

768
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,630
has gone mad!

769
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,830
He wants to dig his brother's grave.

770
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,790
In the following 15 days,

771
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,230
all the entrances to Luoyang,

772
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,510
no matter for boats or carriages,

773
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,350
should be examined closely

774
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,909
for anything suspicious.

775
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,989
Contact all the middlemen

776
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,590
and field agents.

777
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,870
If they see any copper boxes

778
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,670
in the city,

779
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:24,800
report to us immediately!

780
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,030
Here.

781
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:27,630
This one.

782
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,190
Move.

783
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,710
Gao Bingzhu!

784
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,350
Gao Bingzhu!

785
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:52,830
Gao Bingzhu!

786
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,150
Gao Bingzhu!

787
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:09,990
Gao Bingzhu!

788
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,710
Madam!

789
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,510
Madam, are you alright?

790
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,510
Why did you get up?

791
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,150
Where is Gao Bingzhu?

792
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,230
Where is he?

793
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,550
Where?

794
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,150
We were in a grave situation that day.

795
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,510
After we found you,

796
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,790
we immediately brought you back.

797
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,630
We didn't pay attention.

798
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,510
Indeed.

799
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,270
Gao Bingzhu.

800
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,470
Li Beiqi.

801
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,710
I want to see Li Beiqi.

802
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,750
We didn't see Sir Li.

803
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,790
He probably went out.

804
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,110
Tell him to see me

805
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,910
after he's back.

806
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,510
Yes.

807
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,270
We will.

808
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,390
Madam, have a rest now.

809
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,110
Your medicine is here.

810
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,300
[Li Chun, Interior Guard]

811
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,350
If you don't have other orders,

812
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,550
I'll bring the medicine

813
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,430
to Sir Wu now.

814
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,110
What happened to him?

815
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,430
Sir,

816
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,750
we confirmed with the Customs Office.

817
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,270
Nobody saw the copper box

818
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,110
Gao Bingzhu mentioned.

819
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,470
Nothing has been reported

820
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,310
from those entrances.

821
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,350
In this case,

822
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,070
Four Season Clan

823
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,510
hasn't transported

824
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,790
a large number of Thunders
they made to Luoyang.

825
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,070
We haven't received

826
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,710
any related news.

827
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,790
Could the Thunder

828
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,790
really cause such huge damage as you described?

829
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,350
I saw it with my eyes.

830
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,830
The Thunder

831
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,670
caused a landslide in the North Mountain.

832
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,470
It was just a defective product

833
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,670
discarded by the Clan.

834
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,070
If they improve the formula,

835
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,590
I can't imagine how powerful it will be.

836
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,030
In your opinion,

837
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,230
why did

838
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,950
Four Season Clan

839
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,510
make such a powerful weapon?

840
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,350
The Ceremony of Light.
