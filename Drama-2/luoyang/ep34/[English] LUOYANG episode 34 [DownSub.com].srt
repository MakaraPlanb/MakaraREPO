[Luoyang]

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,650
[Episode 34]

4
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,259
Somehow,

5
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,030
the killer who I brought back

6
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,860
from the Clan has been helping

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,620
me look for the Thunder

8
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,410
around the Heavenly Temple.

9
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,090
Is it possible

10
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,830
that the Ceremony was just a guise?

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,490
They might have planned a bigger conspiracy.

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,700
My lord.

13
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,380
My lord.

14
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,410
Hanjia Granary was blown up.

15
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,020
What?

16
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,850
The fire hasn't been put out,

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,130
but we can be sure that

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,500
most of the grain reserves

19
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,260
will be destroyed.

20
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,140
Is it true?

21
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,460
Hanjia Granary was set on fire.

22
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,020
The explosive device

23
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,100
is very powerful.

24
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,010
Also, it's windy today

25
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,300
and grain is inflammableï¼Œ

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,370
so...

27
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,770
Say it.

28
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,300
So

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,030
nearly 100 granaries by the river
have been damaged to different extents.

30
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,370
I've asked the nearby guards to demolish

31
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,610
the houses located downwind of the fire.

32
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,130
It can prevent the fire

33
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,380
from spreading

34
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,260
to the downtown area.

35
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Any casualties?

36
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,660
We're working on it.

37
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,410
The Grand Court, Interior Guard Services,
and imperial guards

38
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,210
are doing their best

39
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,490
to rescue the injured.

40
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,620
My lord,

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,180
most of the grain in Luoyang

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,360
was stored in Hanjia Granary.

43
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,330
Now the Granary was destroyed.

44
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,540
I'm afraid that

45
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,460
Luoyang will be in chaos.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,210
I sent more interior guards
and palace guards to the scene

47
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,220
after I inspected it

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,579
under Your Majesty's command.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,530
Many craftsmen are there, too.

50
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,010
So we haven't worked out
the number of casualties.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,710
Do you mean I shouldn't

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,090
have sent you to inspect the scene?

53
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,410
It's not what I meant.

54
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,570
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Take my order.

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,100
Get grain boats ready for canal transportation.

57
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,220
Tell the director-generals

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,270
in different regions to collect new grain

59
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,620
and have them shipped

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,820
to Luoyang in ten days.

61
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,980
If our people are panicking,

62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,630
let them know

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,230
they are in safe hands

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,980
as long as I'm alive.

65
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,940
Those clowns thought

66
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,650
they could destroy Luoyang

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,330
and me by burning the Granary

68
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,140
to the ground.

69
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,730
Ridiculous.

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,230
Find out who was behind the explosion.

72
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,220
Wu Youjue.

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,410
Yes.

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,130
Look into it thoroughly

75
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,899
and get back to me.

76
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,340
Our Services didn't get

78
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,620
a single clue before the explosion.

79
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,620
The Clan did it

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,560
when we were busy with the Ceremony.

81
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,940
They must have been

82
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,540
planning it for a while.

83
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,430
Luoyang is going to be in chaos.

84
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,300
Why did they have to

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,260
blow up Hanjia Granary?

86
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Her Majesty is enraged this time.

87
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,460
If we can't give her

88
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,500
a solid explanation,

89
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,420
[Palace of Immortality]

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,409
the efforts we've made

91
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,380
will go down the drain.

92
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,420
Don't worry.

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,100
I'll investigate it as soon as possible.

94
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,100
We didn't even see

95
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,700
the perpetrator.

96
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,030
How to investigate it quickly?

97
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,860
Your Highness.

98
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,300
Your Highness.

99
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,260
What's up?

100
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,960
Your Highness,

101
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,110
I need to tell you something important.

102
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,300
Your Highness, my lord,

103
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,700
if you'll excuse me.

104
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,050
What's it?

105
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,660
According to my sources,

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,980
Gao Bingzhu and Baili Hongyi

107
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,820
showed up at the spots where the Thunder

108
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,620
was placed before the explosion.

109
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,900
Great.

110
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,220
It sounds suspicious.

111
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,300
Go look into it.

112
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,100
Yes.

113
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,370
Sir, a letter from our Services.

114
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,020
Agent Gao,

115
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,060
one more thing.

116
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,370
What's it?

117
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,070
The Interior Guard Services found
where Madam Wu had been.

118
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,490
She went to Hanjia Granary yesterday.

119
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,980
Stop!

120
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,250
Did you see Madam Wu of Interior Guard Services?

121
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,090
Who?

122
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,260
Did you see Madam Wu?

123
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,770
No.

124
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,700
Go.

125
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,300
Hurry up.

126
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
Go to the south.

127
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,090
Got it.

128
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,450
Move.

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,060
Move.

130
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,620
Put out the fire.

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,100
Sister,

132
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,820
what are you doing?

133
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,060
Master told us

134
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,100
to support

135
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,860
each other.

136
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,980
Did you forget

137
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,700
what he said?

138
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm surprised you even remembered it.

139
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,060
Then tell me

140
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,860
why Gao Bingzhu could find

141
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,620
the Thunder.

142
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,340
I've never asked about the Thunder

143
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,890
since it was made.

144
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,770
I don't even know

145
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,300
where it is.

146
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,580
How can I

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,659
tell others about it?

148
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,500
Sister,

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,850
we are both from the Clan.

150
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,570
I need to remind you again.

151
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,900
We should

152
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
support each other.

153
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,940
No surprise.

154
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,890
It was you.

155
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,340
If it hadn't been for you,

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,800
the evil Empress would have been killed.

157
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,850
You're narrow-minded.

158
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,110
Do you think we could've

159
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,260
achieved the greater good

160
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,180
if we had used the Thunder to kill

161
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,450
the evil Empress

162
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,810
at the Ceremony of Light?

163
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,820
What do you mean?

164
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,890
The Crown Prince will succeed to the throne
 after the Empress dies.

165
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,430
The Throne will be passed down
to their descendants.

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,930
They won't stop

167
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,500
chasing after us.

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,180
They will kill us at all costs.

169
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,060
At that time,

170
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,220
the greater good

171
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,410
won't be achieved

172
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,010
but ruined by you.

173
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,060
Do you think you can achieve it

174
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,780
by blowing up Hanjia Granary?

175
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,090
Take him down.

176
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,160
Destroying Hanjia Granary

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,860
is just the beginning.

178
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,100
Siyue.

179
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,090
Siyue.

180
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,210
Siyue.

181
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,300
Siyue.

182
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,700
Siyue.

183
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
My lady,

184
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,970
how come?

185
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,260
He was totally fine before he left home.

186
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,100
My lady,

187
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,140
what happened?

188
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,660
My lord,

189
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,540
let's go.

190
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,330
What are you doing?

191
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,090
What are you doing?

192
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,100
What are you up to?

193
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,050
You aren't welcome here.

194
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,300
What would you like

195
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,020
for lunch, my lord?

196
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,250
Barbecue from Quan Shan Fang

197
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,490
or lamb soup from Tao?

198
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,370
I'll get you some.

199
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,180
Siyue.

200
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,020
Siyue.

201
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,260
Siyue.

202
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,460
Siyue.

203
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
How is Lord Hongyi?

204
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,330
He is sad.

205
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,300
Give him some time.

206
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,210
Uncle Baili,

207
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,500
please get him some herbs

208
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,860
that help to rest his mind.

209
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,380
I'm worried that he will fall ill

210
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,820
because of sadness.

211
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,420
Yes, my lady.

212
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,180
Siyue.

213
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,460
Siyue.

214
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,300
Siyue.

215
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,620
Madam Wu.

216
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,210
No.

217
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,340
Siyue.

218
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,060
Beiqi.

219
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,820
Hongyi.

220
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,620
Why aren't you

221
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,650
greeting your brother?

222
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,900
A dead person

223
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,130
showed up before me out of the blue.

224
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,810
How shall greet you?

225
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,700
Or,

226
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,700
how shall I greet

227
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,170
a member from Four Season Clan?

228
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,960
It seems that you're aware.

229
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,690
People in the Clan

230
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,770
call me Lord of Spring,

231
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,140
but you

232
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,770
should call me brother.

233
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,300
You are not my brother.

234
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,900
You are a rebel of Four Season Clan.

235
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,540
Why are you here?

236
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,460
You're my little brother.

237
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,700
You lost your friend

238
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,380
who grew up with you.

239
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,859
Shouldn't I visit you?

240
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,700
Shen Fei was killed

241
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,090
by the Clan.

242
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,380
Not by me.

243
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,780
People are afraid of me

244
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,020
when they see me.

245
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,800
Only you look at me

246
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,580
without any fear in your eyes.

247
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
I remember you didn't even

248
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,730
reach my shoulders when I left.

249
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,010
Why did you choose Hanjia Granary
over the Heavenly Temple?

250
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,660
All the clues led to the Temple,

251
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,410
but you blew up the Granary.

252
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,410
Why?

253
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,980
When was the last time we met?

254
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,740
Are you huffy?

255
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,530
You're still like a child.

256
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,300
Hongyi,

257
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,710
are you going to treat me as a stranger?

258
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,300
You're always

259
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,340
very gifted.

260
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,020
We studied at the same academy

261
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,210
although you are 10 years younger than me.

262
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,090
Do you remember that

263
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,370
we dined and lived

264
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,660
together?

265
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
That was a good time.

266
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,130
Why did you kill Father?

267
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,810
Why didn't you kill me as well?

268
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Don't worry.

269
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,540
Someone will come to your rescue soon.

270
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,540
My lady,

271
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,780
Lord Hongyi...

272
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,340
My lady.

273
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,820
My lady,

274
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,130
Lord Hongyi...

275
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,940
Don't worry, Yunzhi.

276
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,700
He will be fine.

277
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,460
Let me have a look.

278
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,820
I know what is

279
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
on your mind.

280
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,220
I bet you want to know

281
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,410
what has happened

282
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,450
to me, right?

283
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,130
Wait.

284
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,060
Siyue,

285
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,620
go easy on me.

286
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,990
I want to make sure you're safe.

287
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,370
You got hurt.

288
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,890
I'll fetch a doctor.

289
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
I'm fine.

290
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,060
â™«Lonely footsteps are heartbreakingâ™«

291
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,410
Siyue!

292
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,500
Hurry up!

293
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,890
â™«A bleak landscapeâ™«

294
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,300
I know you hate me.

295
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,460
I also understand

296
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,270
â™«I drew down the day when you came overâ™«

297
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,180
we can't be together,

298
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,460
but I get to protect you

299
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,260
all the time.

300
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,390
â™«I suppressed my curiosity that dayâ™«

301
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,660
I'm already happy.

302
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,540
Siyue,

303
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,660
what do you want to do?

304
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,770
I'll do as you say.

305
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,010
â™«Everything looked the same,
but why was I sadâ™«

306
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,220
â™«What happened is like a dreamâ™«

307
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,330
Get him out here.

308
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,310
â™«I went against the world
but I still can't earn your heartâ™«

309
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:45,610
â™«I realized how stubborn I was
years laterâ™«

310
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,540
Brother.

311
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,010
â™«Smile, there is still a long way to goâ™«

312
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,360
He was only this tall

313
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,970
when I adopted him.

314
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,840
â™«I still expect to know you
after drinkingâ™«

315
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,810
I watched him grow up.

316
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,440
â™«Life is full of happiness and sorrowâ™«

317
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
â™«It would be better not to mention itâ™«

318
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,580
He was so naughty when he was little.

319
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,290
â™«I drink wine while appreciating the viewâ™«

320
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,300
I invested a lot in him.

321
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,740
He finally became a useful man.

322
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,920
â™«Our stories are in the pastâ™«

323
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,420
Why did he

324
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,930
do this?

325
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,960
â™«I hope you are still doing greatâ™«

326
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,580
Why did he do this?

327
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,050
Brother.

328
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,140
â™«I hope you can still think of meâ™«

329
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,270
â™«I drink wine while appreciating the viewâ™«

330
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,340
I need to ask him.

331
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,810
â™«We are meant to be apartâ™«

332
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,420
What on earth

333
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,060
was he thinking?

334
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,690
â™«I miss you a lotâ™«

335
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,620
Brother.

336
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:28,270
â™«I saw the moonlight splashing
on the mountainâ™«

337
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,100
I can't ask him anymore.

338
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,780
Li Beiqi.

339
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,450
Did I make a mistake?

340
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
You are extremely talented

341
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,290
and fond of crafts.

342
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,530
I know

343
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,100
Father liked you.

344
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,890
Even Grandfather,
who was cold to others, liked you.

345
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,500
He taught you

346
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,810
how to make things.

347
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,860
I would watch from a distance.

348
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,620
I'm a fan

349
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,500
of liberal arts,

350
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,100
so he looked down upon me.

351
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,460
He had a colleague

352
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,300
at North Sea Academy,

353
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,110
who liked to comment on politics.

354
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
He called himself Lord Freedom.

355
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,580
Grandfather didn't like him,

356
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,740
but that man was willing

357
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,660
to chat with me

358
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,010
about this and that.

359
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,220
Our family only

360
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,050
advocates useful skills,

361
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,340
so I secretly learned

362
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,650
from that man.

363
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,820
Lord Freedom?

364
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,370
Yes.

365
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,530
He is my master.

366
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,460
What are you trying to say?

367
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,970
I learned a lot

368
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,090
from my master

369
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,420
as I grew up.

370
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,300
My master said that

371
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,900
the weeds are all over the fields

372
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,100
and we should set fire to them.

373
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,730
The weeds are all over the fields.

374
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,220
Set fire to them.

375
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,970
The weeds are all over the fields.

376
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,170
Set fire to them.

377
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,420
Do you know what weeds are?

378
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,250
The evil Empress says
she appreciates capable people.

379
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,620
She says that you can succeed

380
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,980
as long as you are talented and smart.

381
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,700
She's a liar!

382
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,650
Being good-looking

383
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,380
is everything.

384
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,060
Hongyi,

385
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,340
you were born healthy and talented.

386
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,860
You will never understand.

387
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,580
A person born with a deformity

388
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,180
will be regarded

389
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,150
as a weirdo

390
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,010
even if he just has

391
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,260
one extra finger.

392
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,900
Do you think

393
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,580
it's fair?

394
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,450
There is nothing wrong with deformities.

395
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,540
Those who settle for ordinary

396
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,060
are the weeds.

397
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,780
You're still

398
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,420
engulfed by hatred.

399
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,220
A person doesn't rush

400
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,140
to achieve anything

401
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,980
but he is at a level
that others can't reach.

402
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,220
What does it mean?

403
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,420
Do you have any idea?

404
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,140
Kuanren,

405
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,290
stop quoting the classics.

406
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,820
You always say you have an ambition.

407
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,540
Then tell us

408
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,770
what it is.

409
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,040
Is it to serve the country

410
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,420
or to benefit the people?

411
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,660
You petty scholars will never understand me.

412
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,050
It's not about the country

413
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,530
nor the people.

414
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm pursuing the natural order.

415
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,700
What's it?

416
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,620
Could you please explain it?

417
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,000
Females don't get involved in politics.

418
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,060
Officials don't overthrow the ruler.

419
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,260
The ruler should

420
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,890
be capable and ethical.

421
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,570
They should put their words into action.

422
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,660
Careful with your words.

423
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,620
You and your family

424
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,090
will get in trouble if you're overheard.

425
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,740
Don't you

426
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,700
think so?

427
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,380
Well...

428
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,780
Today, the ruler is cruel

429
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,620
and judges people by their looks.

430
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,010
It's not right.

431
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,730
People with disabilities can't be officials.

432
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,210
People who agree with it

433
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,740
should all die.

434
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,650
Am I wrong?

435
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,540
Don't be silly.

436
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,140
We are brothers.

437
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,250
Do you understand me?

438
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,860
Was Father also part of the weeds?

439
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,340
Why did you kill him?

440
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,300
I didn't.

441
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,810
I'm not interested

442
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,180
in killing.

443
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,860
No matter who died,

444
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,410
they were just a part of the bigger plan.

445
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,950
The explosion in Hanjia Granary
was also a move.

446
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,530
Don't dwell on it.

447
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,810
What you should know is

448
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,450
that fire is spreading in Luoyang

449
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,180
and I'm winning.

450
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,330
Hanjia Granary was a move.

451
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,010
There are seven landmarks in Luoyang.

452
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,860
The Heavenly Monument is the highest
while the Heavenly Temple is the largest.

453
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,020
The Tianjin Bridge is
at a critical position.

454
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,780
You have the Lianshan Rhyme.

455
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,500
You can easily destroy Luoyang.

456
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,010
Why did you choose Hanjia Granary?

457
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,550
Is it because

458
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,780
your goal isn't

459
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,930
to destroy Luoyang?

460
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,140
Good.

461
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,290
Well done.

462
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,020
No wonder Father and Grandfather

463
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,850
liked you more than me.

464
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,580
You are smart.

465
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,100
If we can work

466
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,890
together,

467
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,130
we can achieve

468
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,340
whatever we want.

469
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,220
You wish.

470
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,860
Shame.

471
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,530
Such a shame.

472
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,450
Take her here.

473
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,780
Father loved you a lot.

474
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,700
You should be the one

475
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,930
to avenge his death.

476
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,050
Father was killed

477
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,930
under her command.

478
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,380
You always want to avenge Father's death.

479
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,770
Now you have a chance.

480
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,740
Do it.

481
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,690
Kill her.

482
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,770
You're not the only one

483
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,580
who wants revenge.

484
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,450
Why did you selfishly

485
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,460
kill my father?

486
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,060
Kill her.

487
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,660
He was nothing but a slug.

488
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,500
He deserved it.

489
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Kill her.

490
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,260
Kill me.

491
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,170
Do it.

492
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,300
Do you think your father

493
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,290
wants to see

494
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,780
you become

495
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,580
a murderer?

496
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,330
You will be in danger.

497
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,050
Kill her.

498
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,090
Song Liang will be

499
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,460
punished by law for the rebellion.

500
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,300
Do it.

501
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,900
You would be no different from him

502
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,020
if you killed him.

503
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,340
Why are you hesitating?

504
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,690
Your goal is

505
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,020
to kill your enemy, isn't it?

506
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,220
Hongyi,

507
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,580
kill her.

508
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,060
Do it.

509
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,380
Hongyi!

510
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,900
You say that weeds are those
 who settle for ordinary.

511
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,770
But you get to decide

512
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,490
who these people are.

513
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,420
You're just saying that

514
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,290
to cover up

515
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,380
your ambition.

516
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,610
You're wrong.

517
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,330
It doesn't matter if you understand me or not.

518
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,480
After I achieve the greater good,

519
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,580
you will see that

520
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,980
I am

521
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,330
right.

522
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,060
Siyue.

523
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,290
Gao Bingzhu.

524
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:09,720
â™«It's been a rainy night in Luoyangâ™«

525
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,230
â™«The scars have faded in timeâ™«

526
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:24,240
â™«The story of your life
is written in your palmâ™«

527
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,220
â™«Love, hatred, and everythingâ™«

528
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,060
â™«How I wish fate will be in my favorâ™«

529
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:41,340
â™«The mist has thinned in the suburbs.
Your silhouette, however, has fadedâ™«

530
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:49,280
â™«Right, wrong, success, or failure.
Who shall be free from all of themâ™«

531
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,970
You're alive.

532
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,420
Thank god!

533
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,210
I'm relieved.

534
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,890
â™«The Tower of Buddhist
is the same as everâ™«

535
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,700
â™«What is it trying to tell usâ™«

536
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:05,530
â™«Suddenly, I understand it allâ™«

537
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,620
You're a suspect

538
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,580
of blowing up Hanjia Granary.

539
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,130
I need to bring you to the Grand Court
for investigation

540
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,140
under the command of Lord Gao.

541
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,250
Do you have any evidence?

542
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,370
Take him.

543
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,010
Yes.

544
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,580
Wait.

545
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,660
How can you arrest him

546
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,580
without any evidence?

547
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,180
Sorry, madam.

548
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,090
I'm doing what I'm asked to do.

549
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,220
Pei Jian.

550
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,850
Gao has nothing to do

551
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,730
with the Clan.

552
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,740
He is annoying, indeed,

553
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,820
but there's no evidence of him
 being related to the Clan.

554
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,130
I'll explain it

555
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,820
to Lord Gao.

556
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,260
You can go.

557
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,170
Thank you, sir.

558
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,970
Let's go, Siyue.

559
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,060
Brother.

560
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,010
There must be some clues

561
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,170
on the site.

562
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,140
I want to stay and have a closer look.

563
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
The ruins of the houses

564
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,960
can fall down at any time.

565
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,210
You should be careful

566
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,220
when searching.

567
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,330
Li Chun.

568
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,500
Yes.

569
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,140
Take some guards to stay here.

570
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,700
Take good care of Madam Wu.

571
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,610
Yes, sir.

572
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,260
Why are you here?

573
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,540
Li Beiqi had been missing for days.

574
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,620
We were looking for him.

575
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:30,820
I found that

576
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
he came here.

577
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,659
I came to find him.

578
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,620
Unexpectedly,

579
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,610
he'd been working for the Clan.

580
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,820
He tied me up.

581
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,219
Li Beiqi?

582
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,620
Where is he?

583
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:47,739
My brother came

584
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,060
to save me just now.

585
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,130
Li Beiqi

586
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,300
is dead.

587
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
I don't understand

588
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
why he betrayed us.

589
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,740
Why did he work for the Clan?

590
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,820
We will figure it out.

591
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,860
What?

592
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,770
The Clan has been disrupting
Luoyang the whole day.

593
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,970
Can't you even find out

594
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,300
what their plan is?

595
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,420
Hanjia Granary was destroyed.

596
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,180
You guys look as lost

597
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,850
as some homeless dogs.

598
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,780
I'm not paying you generously

599
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,730
so that you can act terrified and overwhelmed

600
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,180
when things go wrong.

601
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,210
Please pardon me, Your Majesty.

602
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,050
Don't be mad, Your Majesty.

603
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,710
Don't let it hurt your health.

604
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,930
Your Majesty,

605
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,980
the Clan interrupted

606
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,170
the Ceremony

607
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,660
and destroyed Hanjia Granary.

608
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,610
It was such grave disruption,

609
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,060
but the Intelligence Services

610
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,370
hadn't foreseen anything.

611
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,860
They failed to do their job.

612
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,880
They should be held
accountable for this incident.

613
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,570
If not,

614
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,530
we wouldn't be able to face the civilians.

615
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,540
An incompetent leader

616
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,500
exhausts their followers.

617
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,120
The Services has been serving
Your Majesty for years.

618
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,180
Its loyalty and abilities
are unquestionable,

619
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,450
but it lacks

620
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,050
a decisive and competent

621
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,900
person in charge.

622
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,100
Do you mean

623
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,250
the head of the Services

624
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,980
should be replaced?

625
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,850
What I mean is that

626
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,090
the current Lord Chu

627
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,980
is loyal for sure,

628
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,420
but

629
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,820
his abilities...

630
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,820
Since you've suggested it,

631
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,530
you must have a candidate in mind.

632
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,140
Your Majesty,

633
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,100
I would like to recommend Wu Youjue
of the Interior Guard Services

634
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,260
to take over

635
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,210
the Intelligence Services.

636
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,290
Ask Wu Youjue to see me.

637
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

638
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,570
Half of the Granary was destroyed

639
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,940
and twenty percent of it was heavily damaged.

640
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,260
By 9 am,

641
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,930
46 people were found dead

642
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,290
and over 100 were severely injured.

643
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,540
By 7 pm,

644
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,210
78 were found dead

645
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,810
and over 200 were severely injured.

646
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,100
Her Majesty summoned King of Jin

647
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,570
and Sir Wu to discuss the explosion,

648
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,620
but she hasn't summoned

649
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,460
our Services.

650
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,220
What does she mean?

651
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,660
Don't guess Her Majesty's intention.

652
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,410
Hanjia Granary

653
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,500
is the livelihood of Luoyang.

654
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,740
It was destroyed without any signs.

655
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,060
Naturally, Her Majesty would be mad.

656
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,450
I would rather

657
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,340
she tells you off.

658
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,580
We didn't foresee any signs

659
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
of the explosion.

660
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,460
We deserved to be criticized.

661
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,020
Even though Her Majesty hasn't

662
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,340
told us off,

663
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,140
people who have been against us...

664
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Gao Bingzhu

665
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,650
kept the Temple safe

666
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,930
and you did your job.

667
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,500
Also...

668
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,380
Her Majesty assigned

669
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,340
me to be Lord Chu

670
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,330
because she trusted me.

671
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,020
I let her down.

672
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,450
I deserve

673
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,500
any criticism

674
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,930
and punishment.

675
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,650
I'm here too late.

676
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,130
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

677
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,300
You can get up.

678
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,330
Thanks, Your Majesty.

679
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,220
You don't have to apologize.

680
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,740
You must have a lot to do

681
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,890
after the explosion.

682
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,260
That's my job.

683
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,850
I have to do my best.

684
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,300
If I give you another job,

685
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,850
can you handle it?

686
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
I don't understand.

687
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,330
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

688
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,180
I'm wondering

689
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,140
if the position of Lord Chu

690
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,130
should be handed over to another person.
