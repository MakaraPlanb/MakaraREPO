How is it?

386
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,780
Not bad.

387
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,700
Come on.

388
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,540
Come and have a look.

389

Yes.

Where have you been yesterday?

395
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,460
Your wanted notice is everywhere in the city,

396
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,100
and you're still going around.

397
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,660
Are these injuries healing soon?

398
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,810
It's fine now.

399
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,130
Baili's mansion is organizing a joyous event.

400
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,060
Do you know?

401
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,380
Why are you asking this?

402

You don't have to ask.

403

It's always like this.

404
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,420
You don't want to tell me anything,

405
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,140
but you want me to tell you everything.

406
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,740
I don't want to tell you

407
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,060

He passed Xiuxing Lane at noon,

and continue to the north.

412
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,940
He arrived at Jishan Lane in the afternoon.

is getting married today.

416
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,370
He's going to marry Miss Liu from Hedong.

417
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,690
The Liu family from Hedong is rich and powerful.

418

They were senior officials for generations.

This marriage

420
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,570

Master Xunshan, who arranged it.

426
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,330
In my opinion,

427
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,020
if her father is around,

428
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,020
he'll not allow the daughter

429
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,500
to be in this position.

how's he?

432

433
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,770
is smart.

434
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,820
I heard that he's knowledgeable

435
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,700
and knows the skills of works.

436
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,970
Even though he's knowledgeable and smart,

437
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,180
but he doesn't know how to deal with people.

438
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,970
I never thought that someone like him

439
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,580
will get married.

440
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,260
When Baili's mansion is organizing the event,

441
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,940
is there any way for me to get in?

Why did he go to Xiuye Lane?

447
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,330
Xiuye Lane.

448
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,180
How's that different?

a card like this.

520
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,130
Even though our family

521

is well known in He Luo,

522
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,130

How many Ministers have become a criminal in a day,

524
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,420
and it's not one or two people only?

525
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,580
Being in a place where one is apt to get into trouble,

526
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,780
every step that you take,

527
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,700
every stair that you climb,

528
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,500
you have to be careful.

529
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,130
Once you said something wrong,

530

the Baili family

531
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,860
will get into trouble.

532
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,980
Just like this card,

533
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,100
if one part of it is defective,

534
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,330
then everything will be out of order.

535
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,170
Just like your brother,

536
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,450

537
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,170
and that's what he got.

538
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,660
It's a lesson for us to learn.

539
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,970
I don't want to make connections with the Liu family,

540
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,130
but with the Liu family as our backup

541

For Miss Liu,

550
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,020

00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,090
Alright.

753
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,100
Yuehua,

754
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,130
how's the investigation on the informer?

755
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,020
How did Baili Erlang know about

756
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
the matters relating to the informer?

757
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,700
They came and met me.

758
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,980
What did they tell?

759
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,020
They said

760
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,380
they were from Lianshan.

761
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,020
After a while,

762
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,060
a mysterious man told me that

763
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,490
they were dead.

764
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,100
A mysterious man?

765
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,900
The criminal who killed the informer

766
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,090
has been murdered in the Court of Judicial Review.

767
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,880
[Wanted]

768
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,940
The mysterious person mentioned by Baili Erlang,

769
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:12,940
is it this person?

770
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,060
Yes, it's him.

771
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,790
[Wanted]

772
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,180
This person killed peoples from the Court of Judicial Review

773
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,250
and inner guards before he fled.

774
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,180
He's very dangerous.

775
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Also, I received news that

776
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,180
today he might

777
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,860
come to Baili's mansion.

778
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,900
Baili's mansion?

779
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,420
Gao Bingzhu is investigating on the informer.

780
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,220
The informer comes from Lianshan.

781
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,370
The copper material from Lianshan,

782
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,580
my father...

783
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,220
What did you do?

784
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:01,810
Father.

785
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,140
Father.

786
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,780
Gao Bingzhu.

787
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,540
I didn't kill him.

788
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,940
Follow me to the Inner Guards' Office.

789
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,340
Father.

790
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,540
Father.

791
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,780
I'll say that again.

792
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,900
Follow me to the Inner Guards' Office.

793
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,250
Why did you kill my father?

794
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,700
Why did you kill my father?

795
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,620
Baili Erlang.

796
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,940
Gao Bingzhu, let go of him.

797
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,490
If you don't want him to die,

798
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,500
don't come over.

799
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,460
Even if he dies,

800
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,420
you'll not get escaped.

801
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,780
I didn't kill him.

802
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,060
Then why are you here?

803
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,980
Gao Bingzhu.

804
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,620
Now you're a wanted criminal.

805
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,570
Please don't repeat your mistakes.

806
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,380
Let go of him first.

807
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,260
If you want to know

808
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,260
how your father died,

809
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,650
then don't revolt.

810
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,690
Why do I have to trust you?

811
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,260
Because now

812
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,260
I can kill you right away.

813
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,260
Let go of him.

814
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,260
What do you want to do?

815
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,420
Prepare a horse for me.

816
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,850
You come with me.

817
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
I've brought you out.

818
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,410
Where are you bringing me to?

819
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,540
You should tell me what You have promised.

820
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,930
Why did you kill my father?

821
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,810
Let me tell you again,

822
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,220
I did not kill him.

823
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,770
They why

824
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,940
were you in my father's room?

825
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,330
This has nothing to do with you.

826
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,980
Tell me.

827
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,460
You can't leave if you don't tell me.

828
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,500
Why the informer is looking for you?

829
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,490
Who killed the informer?

830
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,300
Who killed your father?

831
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,100
You should check it on your own.

832
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,300
Let go of your hands.

833
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,980
Please make it clear.
