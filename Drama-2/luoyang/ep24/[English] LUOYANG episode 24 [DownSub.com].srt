00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,340
after I kill you,

[Kang Jin, Merchant from the Ke Tribe]

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,740

12
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,060
What about Lord of Spring?

13
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,140
What's his job?

14
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,300
According to what Hua Qingzhi said,

15
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,810
he's not in charge of anything.

16
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,460
He only does research

17
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,940
on the elixir of life in books.

18
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,340
The elixir of life?

19
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,360
Hua Qingzhi doesn't know what it is exactly.

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,860
Anyway,

21
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,260
it's something related to alchemy and medicine.

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,980
After we arrested Lord Freeman,

23
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,730
the two Services

24
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,920
have interrogated him several times.

25
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,660
He didn't mention

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,940
anything about alchemy.

27
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,730
Hua Qingzhi said that

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,350
Lord of Spring and Lady of Autumn
disagree with each other a lot.

29
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,660
Lord of Spring once said that

30
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,180
what Lady of Autumn does

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
is unimportant,

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,300
but he aims for the bigger picture.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,770
The bigger picture?

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,420
Hua Qingzhi worked for Lady of Autumn.

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,380
He despised Lord of Spring,

36
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,890
but I think

37
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,640
Lord of Spring can't be this simple.

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,400
He is a lord in Four Season Divine.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,540
He can't be someone

40
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,300
who only cares about

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,570
alchemy or immortality.

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,900
It seems that Four Season Divine
is way more complicated

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,940
than I imagined.

44
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,290
By the way,

45
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,610
a middleman has located Kang Jin's house.

46
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,260
I informed Madam Wu about this.

47
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,210
I guess she's already arrived there.

48

It's a long journey
between these two places.

91
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,659

Four times a year!

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,659

The Services was established
by officials who were in favor of torture.

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,970
The only aim was to carry out surveillance

and then frame people up.

359
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,860
So when I took charge of the Services,

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,780
This means that

388
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,900
what Four Season Divine needs

389
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,100
is one of them.

390
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,500
We have to narrow it down.

391
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,940
That's why you are here.

392
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,590
We need to go through them one by one.

393
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,500
Recently,

394
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,920
an old Taoist master came to Luoyang.

395
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,420
He gives lectures on Taoism

396
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
every day at Liubai Building.

397
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,970
It is said that

398
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,740
he is a professional in alchemy.

399
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,020
You also know him.

400
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,540
Me?

401
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,460
Who is he?

402
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,420
Lord Liu.

403
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,700
Liu Ran's father.

404
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,610
We'll leave this to you.

405
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,890
I'll check the pharmacies.

406
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,570
I'll work on flame sticks.

407
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,610
See you later.

408
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,220
Don't forget. He is at Liubai Building.

409
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,660
Liu Ran.

410
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,890
Can you go to Liubai Building with me?

411
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,780
Of course.

412
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,340
The weather is great.

413
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,690
It's a nice day for a walk.

414
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,460
Hongyi,

415
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,860
what are we going to do there?

416
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,010
I want to meet your father.

417
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,620
My father?

418
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,570
I spent all of my money

419
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,860
on all these precious ingredients

420
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,890
and finally made this Origin Elixir.

421
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm not bragging about this,

422
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
but this elixir

423
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,410
is priceless.

424
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,610
If the only focus

425
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,100
is the quality of ingredients,

426
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,860
you won't achieve much in alchemy.

427
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,530
[Liu Shi, Master of the Liu Family]

428
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,980
The heating process

429
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,500
-is more important when making elixirs.
-Father.

430
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,570
Liu Ran.

431
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,250
My lord.

432
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,610
Liu Ran,

433
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,980
I asked the cook

434
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,420
to prepare some desserts you like.

435
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,740
Have some later and see if you like them.

436
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,620
Thank you, father.

437
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,340
I'm here today

438
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,380
for some advice.

439
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,540
My daughter, how's it going recently?

440
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Don't worry.

441
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,820
Hongyi is taking care of me.

442
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,810
Everything is alright.

443
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,050
My lord,

444
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,500
I'm here

445
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,740
for advice on alchemy.

446
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,340
Although Lord Liu
has been practicing Taoism for years,

447
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,860
he knows little about alchemy.

448
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,810
I have no idea what alchemy is.

449
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,900
I remember that since I was little,

450
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,740
all the noble people in Luoyang

451
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,620
have been craving elixirs
made by the Liu family.

452
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,580
Your father just said that

453
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,660
timing and temperature

454
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,140
are more important than ingredients.

455
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,620
If other people hear this,

456
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,860
they will laugh at him.

457
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,020
What Lord Liu said

458
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,620
makes sense to me.

459
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,900
As far as I know,

460
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,250
there are hundreds of

461
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,130
existing formulas.

462
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,500
The ingredients are more or less the same,

463
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,500
such as lead, mercury, sulfur,

464
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,370
and cinnabar.

465
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,450
With the same ingredients,

466
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
people still make

467
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,700
different elixirs.

468
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Because

469
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,780
the timing and temperature are different.

470
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,170
This is what

471
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,780
my assistants need to care about.

472
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,500
I know nothing about alchemy,

473
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,700
but I guess it's similar

474
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,690
to cooking.

475
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
An excellent cook

476
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,410
can make

477
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,140
great food

478
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,090
using low-quality ingredients.

479
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,570
With the wrong temperature or timing,

480
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,100
even the best ingredients

481
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,060
will turn into trash.

482
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,980
Well said!

483
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,700
Who are you?

484
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,340
This is my son-in-law,

485
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,940
the second son of the Baili Family,

486
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,330
Baili Hongyi.

487
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,290
How can an outsider tell me what to do?

488
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,170
My lord,

489
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,980
thanks for inviting me today.

490
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,570
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

491
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,250
It is Xuanwu's Pearl, indeed.

492
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
Ordinary people

493
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
won't have access

494
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,780
to any Xuanwu's Pearl this pure!

495
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,610
It should be a tribute to the Court.

496
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,930
Where else

497
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,660
can you find it

498
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,420
apart from the Court?

499
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,810
Many elixirs need Xuanwu's Pearl
to enhance their efficacy,

500
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,010
including Nine Turns Golden Elixir,

501
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,020
Lead-mercury Immortality Elixir,

502
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,300
and Golden Cinnabar Elixir.

503
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,530
Give me some time.

504
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,580
They kept a close eye

505
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,460
on their goods.

506
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,660
Apart from exchanging food or medicine,

507
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,620
they hardly

508
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,980
did business with others.

509
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,860
It seemed that they need to arrive

510
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,820
before a certain date.

511
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,980
So they had set off

512
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,490
before the storm ended.

513
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,500
Not long ago,

514
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,210
a caravan came to Luoyang

515
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,330
and smuggled this.

516
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,340
Maybe they heard something.

517
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,020
During my stay in Luoyang,

518
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,820
I visited some friends and heard that

519
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,540
the Taoist Tiantong in Yuncui Temple

520
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,530
was making the elixir of life.

521
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,620
What he needed

522
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,570
was the purest Xuanwu's Pearl.

523
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,530
Yuncui Temple?

524
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,340
I've been there before.

525
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,540
It's in the east of Luoyang.

526
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,700
Liu Ran,

527
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,330
when are you going to tell me

528
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,250
things about Liu Feng?

529
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,740
Is he back now?

530
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,180
No.

Where did you hear this?

532
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,970
Have you heard of it?

533
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,140
I guess it's true then.

534
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,770
Father,

535
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,700

536
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,900

look what the man is holding.

my father talked about?

578
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,970
I'm not.

579
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,020
That's nonsense.

580
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,900
You must be more careful then.

581
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,180
The ill omen

582
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,810
might happen to your family members.

583
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,570
What should I do?

584
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,570
Is there a way to avoid it?

585
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,730
A spiritual master

586
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,260
is currently visiting us.

587
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,300
He is experienced and powerful.

588
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,220
He made an elixir,

589
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,890
which can help people avoid bad fortune

590
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,060
and live longer.

591
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,210
The only problem is that
it's quite expensive.

592
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:52,980
Money isn't a problem,

593
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,940
as long as it works.

594
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,730
It definitely helps. I can assure you.

595
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,620
I'll go get the elixir.

596
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
Sorry, it's my fault.

597
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,170
Let me help you.

598
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,220
No, it's fine.

599
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,420
[Curse Stick]

600
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,690
Just leave it to me.

601
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,780
I'll pick them up.

602
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,010
Let me help you.

603
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,969
No, thank you.

604
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,179
Hongyi,

605
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,699
did you see that?

606
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,780
Did you notice as well?

607
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,940
When you smelled the bucket,

608
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:22,820
did you notice

609
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,739
the smell of fresh paints?

610
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,699
The bucket is old,

611
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,500
but all the fortune sticks are new.

612
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,540
[Curse Stick]

613
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,130
No, it's fine.

614
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,540
Leave it to us.

615
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,610
Something is wrong here.

616
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,860
Sorry,

617
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,260
this place is not open to visitors.

618
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,590
You can get the elixir there.

619
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:41,780
Thank you.

620
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,570
Go.

621
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,380
This way.

622
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,900
What's wrong?

623
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,140
Don't talk.

624
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,220
We haven't got the elixir.

625
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,180
What happened?

626
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,780
Why are we in the queue now?

627
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,330
Hongyi?

628
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,060
Let's go.

629
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,040
[Red Silk House]

630
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,260
Sir.

631
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,180
Don't worry.

632
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,530
Welcome.

633
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,160
Come here.

634
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,900
Is Peipei here?

635
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,170
Not everyone

636
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,260
can see Peipei.

637
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,060
Sir,

638
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,740
what about me?

639
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,980
Peipei is the one I want to see!

640
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,690
Peipei!

641
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,420
[Chun, Madam of the Red Silk House]

642
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,420
I'll take care of it.

643
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,780
Sir,

644
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,940
how can I address you?

645
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,570
Peipei is not like

646
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,780
other girls.

647
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
It's not easy to see her.

648
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,770
Then tell her

649
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,380
the son of the Liu family is here.

650
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,340
She will see me.

651
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
Liu family?

652
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Which Liu family?

653
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,650
There are at least

654
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,380
twenty or thirty men

655
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,730
named Liu in Luoyang.

656
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,650
Should Peipei meet every one of them?

657
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,730
Just tell me,

658
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,810
how much should I pay?

659
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,970
Everyone in Luoyang

660
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,650
knows how much it is.

661
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,650
A thousand taels if you want to see her.

662
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,580
Ten thousand taels

663
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,140
for her dance.

664
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,660
That's not a problem.

665
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,820
Wait. Wait a second.

666
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,860
Nobody can force her

667
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,850
to see anyone

668
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,570
she doesn't like.

669
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,420
If I can't see her today,

670
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,300
no one can.

671
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,890
The whole Red Silk House

672
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,930
is mine today.

673
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,340
I recognized him.

674
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,940
The Taoist priest in Yuncui Temple

675
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,600
is the person who attacked me

676
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,740
on my way back to Luoyang.

677
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,900
I found no trace of Xuanwu's Pearl

678
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,580
in pharmacies and the black market here.

679
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,730
So it can't be used

680
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,770
to make medicine.

681
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,890
I found no clues

682
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,690
on flame sticks.

683
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,700
A fake Taoist priest...

684
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,820
Fake elixirs...

685
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,220
Assassins from Four Season Divine...

686
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,620
Yuncui Temple it is!

687
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,050
The route to the front palace

688
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,060
is on this map.

689
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,420
These marked places

690
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
are guarded by them.

691
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
I didn't want to alert them.

692
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,300
So I didn't check the backyard.

693
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,620
This is not open to visitors.

694
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,860
You can get the elixir there.

695
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,890
I've got enough information.
