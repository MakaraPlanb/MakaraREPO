Four Season Clan

5
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,009
has set the fire.

6
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,420
They only need to fan the flames a bit

7
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,780
so that the civilians

8
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,850
can be enraged.

9
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,660
Don't take it away!

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,020
You can't take it away!

12
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:53,780
My lord!

13
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,729
My lord!

14
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,220
My son and I rely on the grain

15
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,580
for the next three days.

16
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,340
Please show mercy!

17
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,180
Please, my lord!

18
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,260
Please show mercy to us.

19
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,100
I've just received

20
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,180
a report saying that

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,050
someone in the south market
colluded with Four Season Clan

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,530
to smuggle grain from Hanjia Granary.

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,140
After investigation,

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,860
it turned out to be true.

25
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,180
No, my lord!

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,530
I know nothing about Four Season Clan.

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,460
I dare not steal grain from our country!

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,170
My lord!

29
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,140
Enough with the excuses!

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,690
Slap him!

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,329
Yes!

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,380
Don't!

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,900
How dare you!

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,810
How dare you!

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,540
No excuses!

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,220
How dare you!

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,570
I know that

38
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,340
a lot of you

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,530
have grain stashed away.

40
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,020
I will give you one hour

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,250
to hand your stashes over.

42
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,250
Otherwise,

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
you'll be punished as accomplices
 of Four Season Clan.

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,340
It's uncalled for!

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,530
What Clan?

46
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,460
You didn't catch the rebels.

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,540
We couldn't buy grain,

48
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
and they gave us grain for free.

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,660
What have we done wrong?

50
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,290
How could you do this?

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,020
Move!

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,980
Excuse me!

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,260
Yeah!

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,580
Lord Gao,

55
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,620
what are you doing?

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,580
I am searching for criminals
 from Four Season Clan.

57
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,140
Are you going to interfere, Madam Wu?

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,980
They're innocent civilians.

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,500
Innocent? They stashed away grain
 that belongs to the country!

60
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,820
Bring him back to the Grant Court!

61
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,410
-Anyone who dares disobey my order...
-My lord!

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,130
-...will be punished the same way!

64
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,770
My lord!

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,490
I am innocent!

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,940
Please, don't arrest my father!

67
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,530
You can't do that!

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,010
You can't take him!

69
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,700
-Release him!
-Release him!

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,579
You said the grain belongs to the country.

71
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,460
How can you prove it?

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,570
My lord,

73
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,890
where does the grain in your house come from?

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,540
Get up!

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,579
Maybe you embezzled grain

76
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,900
and made him your scapegoat!

77
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,250
I am innocent!

78
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,660
I am innocent!

79
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,810
My lord, I am innocent!

80
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you want to be taken as rebels?

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,340
Kill that bastard!

82
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,620
We don't want to rebel!

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,740
We just want to kill

84
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,980
the incompetent officials.

85
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,520
If you want to push us down the cliff...

86
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,980
Go back!

87
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,460
We'll drag you down with us!

88
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,060

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,690

90

I know you're all struggling.

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,220
However, the grain you stashed away

101
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,460
was most likely stolen

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,420
from Hanjia Granary.

103
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,050
We won't ask you to return the grain

104
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,410
that you've already obtained.

105
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,100
The authorities are doing their best

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,020
to find out the truth.

107
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,940
Please, hang in there for a few more days.

108
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,980
I promise we will send grain

109
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,860

110
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,659

113
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,500
Yeah.

114
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,100
Who knows if she and that bastard

115
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,020
are on the same side?

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,770
I know her.

117
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,300
She's Madam Wu of Interior Guard Services.

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,450
She's a good person.

119

121

Are you aware of all the riots?

122
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,380
Although the riots

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,850
have been suppressed for now,

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,850
the Intelligence Services
 sent us another message.

125
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,460
Have a look.

126
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,250
They're saying that

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,250
the famine in Luoyang was caused

128
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,980
by the Crown Prince, who's been hoarding grain

129
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,740
in order to make a fortune.

130
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,740
So, tomorrow,

131
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,980
they'll all go to the Eastern Palace

132
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,220
to confront the Crown Prince.

133
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,730
Now that the word is out,

134
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,580
Her Majesty must've already known about it, too.

135

Siyue,

136
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,170
go and get to the bottom of this.

137
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,650
We must make sure that the Crown Prince

138
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,260
is not wronged.

139
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,340

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,220
We need to think of the big picture.

195
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,730
How dare you lecture me?

196
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,940
Wu Youjue,

197
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,059
I got you this promotion.

198
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,539
I can also have you demoted as I want.

199
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,890
I still find it suspicious.

200
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
The Crown Prince is the future emperor.

201
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,260
He'd never risk his future

202
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,050
for some money.

203
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,780
You're right.

204
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,170
Her Majesty has been

205
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,580
watching his behavior closely.

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,500
Besides, he had just

207
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,690
got punished because of Dai Zhou.

208
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,140
He should've laid low at the moment.

209
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,140
In that case,

210
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,740
the Crown Prince was framed

211
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,500
by Four Season Clan.

212
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,450
But why did they do that?

213
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,860
I don't know how Four Season Clan

214
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,540
got to the Crown Prince,

215
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,900
but the people in Luoyang

216
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,010
are furious with the Court.

217
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,700
Four Season Clan

218
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,170
has set the fire already.

219
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,130
At this rate,

220
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,580
the Clan will win over

221
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,620
all the people in Luoyang.

222
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,060
Then, we'll be doomed.

223
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,540
Sir, bad news!

224
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,820
There's a riot in the Unwelcome Well.

225
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,780
Go have a look!

226
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,420
I've got it covered here.

227
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,300
Okay.

228
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,260
My lord,

229
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
as you predicted,

230
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,980
the Crown Prince has been grounded
 by the evil Empress.

231
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,970
The people in Luoyang

232
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,780
could not be more furious.

233
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,260
In that case,

234
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
let's make the last move.

235
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,540
We won't be sitting ducks!

236
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,810
Kill the evil Empress!

237
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,700
Protect the natural order!

238
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,700
Kill the evil Empress!

239
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,060
The evil Empress is incompetent.

240
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,700
The Crown Prince is immoral.

241
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,210
The Heavenly Lord and the people are all enraged!

242
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,490
The fire of Hanjia Granary

243
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,980
was divine retribution.

244
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,690
The servants of the evil Empress

245
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,570
are all evildoers who mistreat good people.

246
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,380
They should be killed!

247
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,370
Anyone in Luoyang

248
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,660
who can kill a servant of the evil Empress

249
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,220
can join the Clan

250
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,220
and enjoy a lifetime of fortune.

251
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,610
If anyone can kill the evil Empress,

252
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,810
they'll become the leader of the Clan

253
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,700
and enjoy the service of all the others.

254
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,140
My lord,

255
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
don't go out!

256
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,730
The whole city is in chaos.

257
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,940
There are people all over the streets.

258
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,100
They're heading to the Imperial Palace.

259
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,220
I heard that they'll rebel against the Court.

260
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,220
Uncle Baili,

261
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,330
get a horse for me.

262
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,570
I want to go to the Palace and see Her Majesty.

263
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,620
We can't just sit here and be starved to death.

264
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
We want to stay alive!

265
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,660
We need food! We need to stay alive!

266
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,010
We need grain!

267
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,900
The Crown Prince is immoral!

[Xuanren Gate, Eastern Luoyang]

289
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,130
[Xuanren Gate]

290
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,180
People from the Unwelcome Well
 shall never enter Luoyang.

291
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,970
Do you want to rebel?

292
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,620
We've been starving for days.

293
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,890
No matter where we go,

294
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,980
we'll die anyway!

295
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,490
We may as well start a rebellion!

296
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,420
Yeah!

297
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,740
Back off!

298
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,420
We'll never get out.

299
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,330
We'll die either way!

300
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,900
Yeah!

301
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Let's overthrow the throne!

302
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,460
If we stay here,

303
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,020
we'll be stuck and die of hunger and illness.

304
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,010
One step forward,

305
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,500
and I'll shoot!

306
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,140
We might live if we take a step forward!

307
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,220
We'll die otherwise!

308
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,020
Let's go!

309
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,410
Yeah!

310
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,130
Let's go!

311
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,300
Let us out!

312
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,940
Let us out!

313
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,260
Let us out!

314
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,140
Stop!

315
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,580
Gao Bingzhu?

316
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,340
How dare you come back here, you shameless man!

317
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,850
Luoyang is in chaos.

318
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,300
You mustn't leave

319
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
the Unwelcome Well.

320
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,740
If you go up there, you'll be killed!

321
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,060
You do think of yourself

322
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,700
as a minion of the Court

323
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,610
now that you've put on the uniform!

324
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,580
If we don't go up there,

325
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,260
we'll be starved to death

326
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,130
in the Well.

327
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah!

328
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,980
Let us out!

329
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,940
Hear me out!

330
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Hear me out!

331
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,850
We will find

332
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,420
the grain stolen from Hanjia Granary.

333
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,810
Nobody will be starved to death.

334
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,090
Cut the crap!

335
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,970
The Clan said that

336
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,200
as long as we join them,

337
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,880
we'll have all the grain we want.

338
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,220
Yeah!

339
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,210
Gao Bingzhu!

340
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,490
Gao Bingzhu!

341
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,020
Let us out!

342
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,210
Shoot!

343
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,090
Wait!

344
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,860
Wait!

345
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,170
We want grain!

346
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,500
Hear me out!

347
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,140
Hear me out!

348
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,380
I, Gao Bingzhu,

349
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,300
am a sinner of the Unwelcome Well.

350
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,740
You all know that

351
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,020
it was because of me

352
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,060
that seven of my friends died.

353
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,570
It was also because of me that my family was ruined.

354
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,780
I've lived in guilt and agony

355
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,010
every day for the past five years.

356
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,530
I did think about

357
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,740
ending my own life,

358
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,170
but now that I've decided to stay alive,

359
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,140
I want nothing more than

360
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,300
to get you out of the Well

361
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,090
and avenge the death of my friends.

362
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,770
I can tell all of you that

363
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,490
it was Four Season Clan,

364
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,610
the almighty Clan in your eyes,

365
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,620
that caused all this.

366
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,060
Impossible!

367
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,140
He's lying to us.

368
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,260
-Don't listen to him.
-Impossible!

369
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,100
Let's get out of here!

370
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,620
Gao Bingzhu!

371
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,970
You're a liar!

372
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,300
My brother died because of you!

373
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,380
Gao Bingzhu!

374
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,820
You killed him!

375
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,540
Stop!

376
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,780
Stop it!

377
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,340
It's been five years.

378
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,580
How come you still don't understand

379
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,730
who on earth

380
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,260
killed your brother?

381
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,290
Five years!

382
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,460
For the past five years,

383
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,490
Gao Bingzhu has given

384
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,690
every one of you

385
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,500
money and food,

386
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,660
and for what?

387
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,050
So that you can treat him

388
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,300
as your enemy today?

389
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,020
We can't let outsiders

390
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,339
think of us

391
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,089
as a bunch of ungrateful

392
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,780
and foolish losers!

393
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,940
I once swore when I was promoted

394
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,580
as a Well officer

395
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
that I would get everyone out of the Well

396
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,780
to live a decent life in Luoyang.

397
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,740
However, so many years have passed,

398
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,020
and you're still here in the Well.

399
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,610
I didn't keep my promise.

400
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,500
I sincerely apologize to you,

401
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,380
but please trust me one more time.

402
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,500
I will definitely

403
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,900
get all of you

404
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,130
out of here one day.

405
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,450
But today is not the day.

406
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,730
Four Season Clan robbed the country of grain

407
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,610
and gave it to you

408
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,140
so that they could instigate you

409
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,460
to rebel against the Court.

410
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,140
Once you get out

411
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,620
of the Well now,

412
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,330
you'll become rebels

413
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,100
and face the death penalty.

414
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,500
If we don't go out,

415
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,780
we'll be starved to death.

416
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,100
Gao Bingzhu,

417
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,060
why should we believe

418
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,340
that you can get us out one day?

419
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,220
Yeah.

420
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,900
We'll die if we stay here.

421
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,450
I don't want to die.

422
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,740
Please, give me some more time.

423
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,780
I will bring the grain back

424
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,340
to you.

425
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,290
Please, trust me one more time.

426
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,820
Your Majesty,

427
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,090
do you need me to fetch the doctor?

428
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,820
As long as

429
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,740
there are riots on the streets,

430
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,020
even ten doctors won't be able to help me.

431
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,130
Leave.

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,170
Your Majesty...

433
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,570
What?

434
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,090
Baili Hongyi, the son of Baili Yan,

435
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,300
the late Minister of Works,

436
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,090
is on his knees outside.

437
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,970
He wants to report something important.

438
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,660
The younger son of Baili Yan?

439
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,540
Yes.

440
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,860
Since Baili Yan was vindicated

441
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,970
of corruption,

442
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,810
Baili Hongyi

443
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,580
has been working for Sir Wu.

444
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,730
Tell Baili Hongyi to come in.

445
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,660
People have been starving for over ten days.

446
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,900
They say that once you join the Clan,

447
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,770
you'll have food.

448
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,180
No one can resist the temptation.

449
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,340
I've been trying to talk sense into them for days,
 but to no avail.

450
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,620
If you hadn't come here in time...

451
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Who sent them

452
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,210
the message?

453
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,460
An outsider came to the Well a few days ago

454
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,370
and delivered the message.

455
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,140
Where is he now?

456
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Why did you instigate

457
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,940
people of the Well to rebel?

458
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,600
Did Lord of Spring ask you to do this?

459
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,780
[Qingye, Disciple of Four Season Clan]

460
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,900
Would you ever have come back

461
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,730
if they hadn't started a riot?

462
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,180
Leave the Unwelcome Well alone!

463
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,770
Lord of Spring has sent many people

464
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,340
to spread the message in Luoyang.

465
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,730
This guy

466
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,540
was sent to the Well.

467
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,290
He beat me to it

468
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,660
and spread the message before I came.

469
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,810
All I could do

470
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,690
was to kill him.

471
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,620
So, I've now paid back

472
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,540
what I owed you.

473
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,570
What are you going to do?

474
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Relax!

475
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,420
I know that you keep me alive

476
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,500
because I am of similar age

477
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,540
with that girl

478
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,620
you mentioned.

479
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,370
I remind you

480
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,810
of her.

481
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,220
She's your younger sister,

482
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,650
so you don't have the heart to kill me.

483
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,820
Am I right?

484
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,820
I was born an orphan.

485
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,450
I envy your sister when I see you

486
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,540
care about her so much.

487
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,540
To be honest,

488
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,540
I've always wanted

489
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,530
a brother like you.

490
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,010
Unfortunately,

491
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
I am not your sister.

492
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,140
You were asking about what I will do next.

493
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,900
I'll tell you now.

494
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,740
Why did you stop me?

495
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,260
Who do you think you are?

496
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,020
I am an orphan.

497
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,250
The Clan raised me.

498
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,210
Now that I've betrayed them,

499
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,490
I can never go back.

500
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,650
I've got no family now.

501
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,210
I've got no other option.

502
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,370
What's the point of staying alive?

503
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,380
What's the point?

504
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,220
I've paid back

505
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,900
what I owed you.

506
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,580
I can only redeem myself

507
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,410
for killing all those people

508
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,650
by ending my own life, alright?

509
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
So, you're aware

510
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,260
that you've killed many people

511
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,820
and committed unforgivable sins.

512
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,220
But if you do have

513
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
a shred of conscience left,

514
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,050
you shouldn't kill yourself.

515
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,500
Death is the easy way out.

516
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,490
It means incompetence.

517
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,130
It means you want to run away.

518
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,540
You should stay alive.

519
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,020
Redeem yourself for the lives you've taken

520
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,460
with the rest of your life.

521
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

522
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,300
What do you want?

523
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,380
I heard that

524
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,170
Sir Wu has been admonishing rebels

525
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,380
at Xuanren Gate by Your Majesty's order.

526
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,500
What?

527
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,980
Anything wrong?

528
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,860
Please, Your Majesty, withdraw your order.

529
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,500
He will likely put his life at risk by doing this.

530
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,780
He's an interior guard.

531
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,660
How could he be afraid of some rebels?

532
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,420
I'm afraid it's not only the rebels he's facing,

533
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,740
but also evildoers of Four Season Clan.

534
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,330
We want food!

535
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,140
We want to stay alive!

536
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,010
We want food!

537
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,050
We want to stay alive!

538
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,570
We want food!

539
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,370
Back then, my brother Baili Kuanren

540
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,140
slandered the Court.

541
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,540
Your Majesty ordered to exile him,

542
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,540
but he then died at home.

543
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,460
However,

544
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,740
he didn't die.

545
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,410
Instead, he joined Four Season Clan.

546
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,250
So?

547
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,620
I know my brother well.

548
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,050
He's got a weakness.

549
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,360
If he writes an article

550
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,340
that he's proud of,

551
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,220
he'll read it in public

552
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,620
for compliments.

553
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,610
He must be

554
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,820
in Luoyang right now,

555
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,100
waiting to show off his masterpiece.

556
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,210
Waiting to show off

557
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,140
his masterpiece in public?

558
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,700
Do you mean that

559
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,090
he'll be there

560
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,620
and watch Sir Wu get killed?

561
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,620
Please, Your Majesty, withdraw your order.

562
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,020
You're all gathered here

563
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,810
for a good reason.

564
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
I, Wu Youjue,

565
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
am a high-up official in the Court,

566
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,330
but I did nothing

567
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,740
to alleviate you from starvation.

568
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,820
I did nothing to comfort

569
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,820
your babies that are crying.

570
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,890
I am utterly ashamed of myself.

571
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,730
But do you know

572
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,770
who is the one that got

573
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,740
our capital into such chaos?

574
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,980
The evil Empress!

575
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,060
The Crown Prince!

576
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,700
-The Empress.
-The Crown Prince.

577
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,820
-The Crown Prince.
-The Empress!

578
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,900
The Empress!

579
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,850
You're all wrong.

580
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,190
[Grain]

581
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
You've misunderstood the situation.

582
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,130
The famine occurred in Luoyang

583
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,290
because an organization

584
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,130
blew up Hanjia Granary

585
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,180
and destroyed the grain reserved for 
over 200,000 households and millions of people.

586
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,250
You're all starving because of that organization!

587
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,690
That organization

588
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,810
is Four Season Clan!

589
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,810
[Grain]

590
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,980
How's that possible?

591
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah.

592
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,740
How's that possible?

593
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,970
The Clan gave us grain.

594
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,740
Liar!

595
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,850
The Clan gave us

596
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,690
grain.

597
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah!

598
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,730
The grain Four Season Clan gave you

599
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,250
was stolen from Hanjia Granary.

600
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,420
The grain they gave you

601
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,940
belonged to you in the first place!

602
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,340
It was stolen from Hanjia Granary.

603
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,650
Think about this, folks!

604
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,500
Hanjia Granary has always been

605
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,890
heavily guarded all these years.

606
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,610
Has anything happened to it?

607
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,770
If it wasn't

608
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,210
purposeful sabotage,

609
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,130
how could it be blown up?

610
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,100
Four Season Clan

611
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,930
was using the grain that belonged to you

612
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,330
to provoke your rage.

613
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,900
They were using the grain that belonged to you

614
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
to create chaos.

615
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,570
They were using the grain that belonged to you

616
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,820
to destroy our peaceful life!

617
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,730
Folks!

618
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,020
Open your eyes and look around!

619
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,860
All the grain on the carriages...

620
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,970
The grain on the carriages

621
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,740
is all that is left

622
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,290
in Luoyang.

623
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,940
I urged Her Majesty

624
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,890
to collect the grain

625
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,460
from all the officials.

626
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,610
We'd rather starve ourselves

627
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,500
than starve the people in Luoyang!

628
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,010
Can you understand

629
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,060
the goodwill of the Court?

630
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,490
Can you feel the grace of Her Majesty?

631
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,340
Is he telling the truth?

632
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,170
You should've all known by now

633
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,020
who is the real enemy of Luoyang.

634
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,930
It's Four Season Clan!

635
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,290
Baili Hongyi,

636
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
do you know

637
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,300
the consequences

638
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,450
of telling me all this?

639
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,140
It means I've deceived Your Majesty

640
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,010
and the Baili family will face the death penalty.

641
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,900
Aren't you afraid of death?

642
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,460
I am,

643
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,930
but I've got no other choice.

644
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,820
I, Wu Youjue,

645
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,050
hereby swear that

646
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,020
I will destroy Four Season Clan

647
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,940
and take back the grain that belonged to you.

648
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,140
I will make sure you can all live a peaceful life.

649
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,820
The officials have given their grain to us.

650
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,980
He has a point.

651
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,780
Why would they

652
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
blow up their own Granary?

653
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,340
There must be evildoers behind all this.

654
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,380
They gave us grain at such a critical moment,

655
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,770
maybe we should trust them for once.

656
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,820
We're grateful to Her Majesty!

657
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,610
Kuanren,

658
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,420
it's been so long since I last met you.

659
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,530
I've been planning this for so long.

660
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,540
I must come to appreciate it.

661
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,220
I don't feel resentment losing to you, though.

662
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,740
Baili Hongyi,

663
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,460
you're quite courageous.

664
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,570
I had already known this

665
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,930
before you told me.

666
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,420
Sir Wu

667
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,460
and your father

668
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,170
released Baili Kuanren in private.

669
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
How could they have fooled me?

670
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,370
It was just that

671
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,460
Baili Yan had always been loyal,

672
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,810
and I didn't have the heart

673
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,300
to see him lose his son.

674
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,540
However, Baili Kuanren

675
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,530
is so ungrateful!

676
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,540
All of this was started by my brother.

677
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,690
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

678
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,170
It's all ancient history.

679
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,140
I am not that petty.

680
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,780
Sir Wu has already reported to me

681
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,380
about this.

682
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
If things are going as expected,

683
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,820
Baili Kuanren

684
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,900
should have been arrested by now.

685
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,060
Brother,

686
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,970
how are you feeling?

687
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,380
Should I go and get the doctor?

688
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,060
No need, I am fine.

689
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,100
Baili Kuanren has been sent to the dungeon.

690
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Do you want to interrogate him now?

691
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,100
It can wait.

692
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,180
I will know how to deal with him

693
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,930
after I talk to Her Majesty.

694
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,770
Brother, you managed to talk sense into

695
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,090
the civilians in Luoyang
 and catch a leader of the Clan

696
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,260
even though you were ill.

697
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,490
It made me realize

698
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,900
the real meaning of 
'Keep order for Her Majesty and protect Luoyang.'

699
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,170
I won't mind more compliments

700
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,620
like this in the future.

701
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,060
No problem!

702
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,290
Brother, I've always respected

703
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,300
you the most.

704
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,130
All jokes aside,

705
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,860
have you found the grain stolen
 from Hanjia Granary?

706
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,740
I heard that it was transported
 to the mountains in northern Luoyang.

707
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,100
Gao Bingzhu and his men are on it.

708
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,820
However,

709
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,340
I still have a disturbing feeling.

710
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,570
The Clan has worked on the plan for five years.

711
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,139
It can't be

712
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,380
ruined by us so easily.

713
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,770
You are right.

714
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,540
Although Lord of Spring

715
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,889
has been arrested,

716
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,340
there are still a lot of remnants

717
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,850
hiding in Luoyang.

718
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,659
We shall not let our guard down.

719
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,239
[Wanted]

720
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,330
Take a closer look! Have you seen her?

721
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,139
Take a closer look!

722
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,340
Lord Pei,

723
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,610
is Peipei of Hong Xiao Fang

724
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,659
really from Four Season Clan?

725
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,860
She attacked the King of East River on the street.

726
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,739
Of course, she's one of them!

727
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
She's so gorgeous,

728
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,340
and she dances and sings so well.

729
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,420
What on earth was she thinking?

730
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,340
The Interior Guard Services

731
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,020
caught the leader of Four Season Clan.

732
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,440
They're so arrogantly proud of themselves now.

733
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,050
If the Grant Court

734
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,060
failed to make a contribution soon,

735
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,540
we'd be despised by them.

736
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,540
-Alright.
-Alright.

737
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,140
Chunhe!

738
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,540
Chunhe!

739
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,500
Chunhe!

740
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,380
Chunhe, what's wrong?

741
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,100
Are those officers looking for me?

742
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,500
Chunhe,

743
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,290
you're safe here.

744
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,130
Don't worry!

745
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,690
I checked around when I came here.

746
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,620
I was not followed.

747
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:28,940
Give it to me.

748
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,900
It's cold on the floor. Get up.

749
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,700
You must be hungry, huh?

750
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,540
I bought a lot of

751
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,900
your favorite food.

752
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,060
Don't worry!

753
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,210
I've made arrangements.

754
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,460
Those officers won't come here.

755
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,370
Rest assured!

756
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,860
Don't you want to know

757
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,740
why they are after me?

758
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,780
I know.

759
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,500
You attacked the King of East River.

760
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,640
There are wanted posters of you

761
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,860
all over the place.

762
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
Aren't you scared of me?

763
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,690
I'm not.

764
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,210
I don't care if you're an assassin

765
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,820
or Peipei of Hong Xiao Fang,

766
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,970
to me, you'll always be Chunhe.

767
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,860
Look what it is!

768
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,100
I remember that

769
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,730
this was your favorite when you were a kid.

770
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,900
The city is experiencing famine now.

771
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,170
I walked around several streets to find this.

772
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,010
I remember that you'd add honey to it

773
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,180
when you were a kid,

774
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,020
otherwise, you'd find it bland.

775
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,420
Here, have some while it's hot.

776
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,340
I've got my reasons.

777
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,060
I am not

778
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,740
the Chunhe you used to know.

779
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,500
The officers will find me sooner or later.

780
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,250
You can't protect me forever.

781
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,300
Leave!

782
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,060
Or we'll all be killed!

783
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,580
Chunhe!

784
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,780
I don't want to get you implicated.

785
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,420
I know that you've suffered a lot all these years,

786
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,820
but I am here with you now.

787
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,700
I won't allow anyone to mistreat you.

788
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,580
If you don't want to stay in Luoyang,

789
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,820
I'll take you anywhere

790
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,940
in the whole wide world.

791
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,180
We'll never come back!

792
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,140
Liu Feng,

793
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,300
I promise you.

794
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,740
Let's go to a place

795
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,100
where no one knows us,

796
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,060
and we'll never come back!
