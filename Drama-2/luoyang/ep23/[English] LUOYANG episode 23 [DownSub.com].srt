196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,010
Kang Zhanbi died of rattle poison.

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,140
Strangely,

198
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,460
Li Ji, who fought with Kang,

199
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,410
died unexpectedly when he was

200
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,680
under escort from the dungeon

201
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,580
to the Henan Prefecture.

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,660
Using rattle poison to cover

203
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,530
the real cause of death

204
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,540
seems to be the Divine's style.

205
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,410
I'll look into Kang Jin soon.

206
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,930
Thanks.

207
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,660
Come to think of it,

208
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Baili Hongyi and I

209
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,940
fight against the Divine

210
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,100
to avenge our family's death.

211
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
You also risk your life

212
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,500
to bring it down.

213
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,810
What for?

214
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,940
To protect Her Majesty

215
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,530
and Luoyang?

216
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,540
Don't flatter me.

217
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,010
It's just my job.

218
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,330
Miss, your lantern is so pretty.

219
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,380
You can have it.

220
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,380
Thanks.

221
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,220
Amazing.

222
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,570
One more time.

223
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,540
Brilliant.

224
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
One more.

225
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,210
I can't believe someone wants to destroy all this.

226
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,340
Put the lantern

227
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,260
right here.

228
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,930
Sure.

229
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,610
Careful.

230
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,140
Okay.

231
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,900
Ding,

232
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,060
you good?

233
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,700
Yeah.

234
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,700
Go help with something else after this.

235
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Yes.

236
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,420
Further down.

237
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,020
Further down.

238
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,820
Sure.

239
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,530
Over there.

240
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,700
Put it over there.

241
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,020
Careful.

242
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,900
Remember to hang them all up.

243
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,820
My lord,

244
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,340
you're finally back.

245
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,460
Why are you home so late?

246
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,050
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

247
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,580
Uncle Baili asked them to decorate the place.

248
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,170
It makes sense.

249
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,680
What? My lord,

250
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,100
tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

251
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,540
And then?

252
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,690
Valentine's Day!

253
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,060
You should prepare

254
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,980
some gifts

255
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,850
for Lady Liu Ran.

256
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,650
Like what?

257
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,540
Like...

258
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,220
Cosmetic products that she uses

259
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,210
or accessories that she likes.

260
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,980
Any of them will do.

261
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,290
Brother,

262
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,650
tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

263
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,810
I got you some festive pastries.

264
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,860
Who are they?

265
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,860
What did they do?

266
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,340
This one looks creepy.

267
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,740
He can't be a good guy.

268
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,370
This one looks familiar.

269
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,180
Perhaps, he is an official.

270
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,300
Look.

271
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,740
Have a closer look.

272
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,700
You only care about cases.

273
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,050
The portraits were sent here

274
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,580
under Madam Yang's order.

275
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,660
They are all

276
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,180
outstanding men in Luoyang.

277
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,060
They're decent and good-looking.

278
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Madam Yang wants to see

279
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,410
if you fancy anyone.

280
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,060
Madam Yang said that

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,260
she'll keep on looking

282
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,530
if you don't like any of them.

283
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,090
Brother.

284
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,930
It's none of my business.

285
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,410
I'm just a messenger

286
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,090
but I think it's a good thing.

287
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,340
Li Ji's death

288
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,980
can't be an accident.

289
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
He must've been murdered.

290
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,650
The killer was informed

291
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,020
as soon as Li was out of our Services.

292
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,650
I guess there are moles in our Services.

293
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,730
This case is tricky

294
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,210
and important,

295
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
but we do

296
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,900
need evidence.

297
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,020
I'll keep looking into it.

298
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,180
I'll keep you updated

299
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,020
of any evidence.

300
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,610
I only have one request.

301
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,980
You can try

302
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,500
your very best

303
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,580
but you can't risk your life.

304
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,330
Yes.

305
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,450
I can't imagine

306
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,530
my sister's life here.

307
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,060
Liu Feng.

308
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,610
Yunzhi.

309
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,860
Liu Feng.

310
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,760
It's so late.

311
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,610
What's up?

312
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,900
I remember you always had food

313
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,620
late at night when you were little.

314
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,660
I made some noodles for you.

315
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,260
I know you like

316
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,620
mandarin fish soup the most

317
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,100
but I still can't make it.

318
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,380
It's fine.

319
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,220
I haven't had it

320
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,660
since Chunhe left.

321
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,300
You can have some noodles.

322
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,620
I spent a while on it.

323
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,660
There is...

324
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,860
Yunzhi, you can go.

325
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,860
I'm going to sleep.

326
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,970
The noodles...

327
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,850
You can take it back.

328
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,780
Yes.

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,060
Chunhe,

330
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,250
where are you?

331
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,540
It's been so many years.

332
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,660
Are you doing okay?

333
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,680
♫Rain is telling me where flowers are♫

334
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,580
Hongyi,

335
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,260
I know you will come.

336
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,200
♫Boats sailed across desert♫

337
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,500
Hongyi.

338
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,630
♫Candles lit up the way to stars♫

339
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,300
What hair oil do you use?

340
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,050
Sweet olive oil.

341
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,420
I'd buy some when the season of sweet olive comes.

342
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,220
♫You are talking about me♫

343
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,980
Do you like the scent?

344
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,660
I made you some spicy soup.

345
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,000
♫I grabbed the corner of your top♫

346
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,490
Is it good?

347
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,050
Not bad.

348
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,500
♫But I was speechless♫

349
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,829
♫We are supposed to be against each other♫

350
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,930
Hot.

351
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,050
♫But fate brought us together♫

352
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:24,190
♫I already fell for it♫

353
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,260
Go.

354
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,380
Hey guys,

355
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,420
it's silverware.

356
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,140
Careful.

357
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,940
Sure.

358
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,050
Same for you guys.

359
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,090
It's the best wine

360
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,890
from Gaochang.

361
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,820
Be careful.

362
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,500
Sure.

363
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,250
Liu Feng.

364
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,570
Sister.

365
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,660
Liu Feng,

366
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,260
why are there

367
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,570
so many people?

368
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,780
what are you up to?

369
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,300
Look,

370
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,180
these are the best specialties
from the West.

371
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,820
I brought them back

372
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,060
particularly for you.

373
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,690
They look gorgeous, right?

374
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,940
Also, I hired

375
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,700
these servants

376
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,780
to look after you.

377
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,500
You don't have to do

378
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,540
anything by yourself.

379
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,940
Liu Feng,

380
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,330
how can you afford these?

381
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,940
Did you go back home?

382
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,250
No.

383
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,810
I've earned money.

384
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,740
I've been away from home

385
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
for so many years.

386
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,260
I have savings to cover them.

387
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,300
In the future,

388
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,810
you can let me know

389
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,620
whatever you need.

390
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,500
My money is all yours.

391
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,490
I'm not like Baili Hongyi.

392
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,460
He is so stingy.

393
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,780
Liu Feng,

394
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,740
you misunderstood

395
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,930
Hongyi.

396
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,580
He is good to me.

397
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,970
There is something

398
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,180
you didn't see.

399
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,980
I hope so.

400
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,620
Anyway, I'm back.

401
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,340
I will take better care of you.

402
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,980
By the way,

403
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,890
do you know

404
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,060
where Chunhe is?

405
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,060
You were kids.

406
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,610
I didn't think you two

407
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,580
were being serious.

408
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,530
How come you still think about her?

409
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,980
She was just

410
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,180
a maid.

411
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,370
She doesn't have family

412
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,700
and not even a surname.

413
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,460
She left right after you left home.

414
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,010
I guess,

415
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
she must be married now.

416
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,770
I'm telling you the truth.

417
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,500
Have some soup.

418
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,210
Hongyi,

419
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,420
you're up.

420
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,290
Did we

421
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,060
wake you up?

422
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,580
Thank you

423
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,620
for the portrait.

424
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,500
It's fine.

425
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,050
You'd better treat my sister

426
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,980
better in the future.

427
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,940
Liu Feng.

428
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,060
Did you make the soup?

429
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,860
Yes.

430
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,220
Alright. I'll leave you to it.

431
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Hongyi,

432
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,220
it was cooked for a while.

433
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,890
Have a seat.

434
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,970
I'll get you some.

435
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,580
Sit down.

436
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,690
Try some

437
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,020
and see how it tastes.

438
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,730
There you go.

439
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,090
Is it good?

440
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,900
Is it good?

441
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,900
How's it?

442
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,020
My sister is always a good cook.

443
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you like it?

444
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,610
I can get you more.

445
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,250
I want more, too!

446
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,500
Liu Feng.

447
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,170
Liu Feng,

448
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,580
save some for Hongyi.

449
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,250
Liu Feng.

450
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,340
Liu Feng.

451
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,370
So good.

452
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,300
What's wrong with him?

453
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,770
Hongyi, why are you smiling?

454
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,370
Never mind.

455
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,890
He ate all the soup.

456
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,540
How about I make you another bowl?

457
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,610
It's fine.

458
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,410
My lord,

459
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,260
Gao Bingzhu is looking into this man for Madam Wu.

460
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,940
An outlander?

461
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,250
Gao's been reading

462
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,730
documents in the Hall of Skills

463
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,610
for 4 hours since he came back.

464
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,060
He said he would

465
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,130
interrogate Hua Qingzhi in an hour.

466
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,740
Hua didn't confess

467
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,850
even after he was

468
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,980
interrogated for three days.

469
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,980
Can Gao make him talk?

470
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,770
Baitan,

471
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,730
have you ever seen the shape of wind?

472
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,580
I haven't.

473
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,770
The wind is invisible.

474
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,180
It is invisible,

475
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,740
but you can see it

476
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,580
when a branch is bent in the wind.

477
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,700
All creatures leave their trails

478
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,980
as long as they exist in the world.

479
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,100
Give him a chance.

480
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,130
Chen Qingzhi.

481
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,940
You were born in Yongzhou

482
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,530
on July 19th, the second year
of the Qiande reign.

483
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,940
You were smart.

484
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,330
You could compose poems at five
and write articles at nine.

485
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,540
You went to school in your region

486
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,050
at eleven.

487
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,050
You got married at nineteen
and had a son the next year.

488
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,500
Your son is named Chen Chao.

489
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,130
13 years ago,

490
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,810
your wife and son died in a flood

491
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,090
so you became alone.

492
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,700
11 years ago, you started to serve
the Intelligence Services

493
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,860
and changed your name to Hua Qingzhi.

494
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,700
Madam,

495
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,540
I just got a message
from the Intelligence Services.

496
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,260
It's for you.

497
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,100
Kang Zhanbi and Kang Jin

498
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,050
led the caravan.

499
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,090
It is made up of 14 people.

500
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,740
Kang Jin has a house

501
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,090
at 3 Xingjiao Place, 2nd Ave.

502
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
People here

503
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,140
all know my background.

504
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,980
It's not a secret.

505
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,700
Anything wrong with it?

506
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,900
Nothing.

507
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm going to read you a poem.

508
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,820
The sun rises in Yongzhou.

509
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,060
Hands feel cold when holding jade.

510
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,100
Fog starts to surround the mountain.

511
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,300
I can't smell any scent of rice.

512
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,740
Does it ring a bell?

513
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,860
It's from a regional exam paper.

514
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,050
You know that

515
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,210
exam papers in different regions

516
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,940
are stored in our Services.

517
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,900
Interestingly,

518
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,140
the examinee who wrote it

519
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
has the same name as your son.

520
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,540
He is also called Chen Chao.

521
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,700
It's not uncommon to have

522
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,620
the same name.

523
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,090
Why did you secretly

524
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,400
check this paper

525
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,180
14 times throughout these years?

526
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,260
Why?

527
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,120
[Iron]

528
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,140
Siyue.

529
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,020
Why are you following me?

530
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,850
I'm working on a case nearby.

531
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,780
I saw your horse

532
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,850
outside the alley,

533
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,810
so I came to find you.

534
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,700
Did you?

535
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
I'm worried about you.

536
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:47,970
Li Ji died

537
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,770
strangely.

538
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,300
The case

539
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,170
is dangerous.

540
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,850
I am worried.

541
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,940
I saw you go out.

542
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,370
I...

543
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,370
Madam,

544
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,460
I'm sorry.

545
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Where are you going?

546
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,940
Stay close.

547
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,380
Here is a story.

548
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,970
A talent called Chen Qingzhi

549
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,450
was picked by Four Season Divine.

550
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,250
The Divine invested a lot in him.

551
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,860
Of course, the Divine trained

552
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,060
many talents

553
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,340
like him,

554
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,180
because these people

555
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,730
were more likely to work as officials.

556
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,090
Once they did,

557
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,770
they naturally became the Divine's

558
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,980
mole in the Court.

559
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,580
Chen Qingzhi

560
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,370
was quite impressive.

561
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,250
He was picked by the Intelligence Services

562
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,170
but he had to cut off

563
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,100
all connections to join the Services.

564
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,020
It means that

565
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,940
he could never see

566
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,810
his son and wife.

567
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,940
I believe

568
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,340
Chen Qingzhi

569
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,490
had struggled a lot.

570
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,570
Nonsense.

571
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,660
[Kang Jin's house, Xingjiao Place]

572
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,660
No one is in there.

573
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,700
Whose house is it?

574
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,180
So many weeds.

575
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,860
It must've been deserted for a while.

576
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,180
An outlander called Kang Jin.

577
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,860
I guess someone wants him dead.

578
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,180
What's wrong?

579
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,780
A person was hung

580
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,540
on the beam.

581
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,970
It was Kang Jin.

582
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,700
Wait.

583
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,770
How are you sure

584
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,980
it was not Kang Jin who did it?

585
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,420
People from the Ke Tribe

586
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,460
always keep their houses tidy.

587
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,970
They won't fight at home,

588
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,980
so Kang must be the victim.

589
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,180
Do you think

590
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,140
Kang Jin is dead already?

591
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,460
There are signs

592
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
of struggling.

593
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,980
He could be alive.

594
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,940
Let's go ask around.

595
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
I've looked

596
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,700
into Chen Chao.

597
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,490
He studied at North Sea Academy.

598
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,300
Now he is doing a basic job

599
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,290
in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

600
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,610
Chen Chao

601
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,140
isn't related to me.

602
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,330
North Sea Academy

603
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,740
has something to do with the Divine though.

604
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,820
The Academy was established

605
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,900
by Lord Freedom

606
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,530
before he was arrested.

607
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,730
Chen Chao managed to cover up his identity

608
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,620
as a disciple of the Divine

609
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,930
by taking the Imperial Examination.

610
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,970
You know what?

611
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,180
His file is still at the Services.

612
00:29:59,420 --> 00:29:59,930
You are?

613
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,420
May I ask you a question?

614
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,450
Are you close to your neighbor Kang Jin?

615
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,290
No.

616
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,370
Do you know Kang Jin?

617
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,300
No.

618
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,260
Excuse me,

619
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,380
do you know Kang Jin,

620
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,540
an outlander living

621
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,140
in that alley?

622
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,380
He is your neighbor.

623
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,740
You should at least know him.

624
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,850
Neighbor?

625
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,730
I don't know.

626
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,970
I don't know him.

627
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,450
I have no idea.

628
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,380
I don't know him.

629
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,700
I don't know him.

630
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,420
Do you live nearby?

631
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,900
Yes.

632
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Do you know Kang Jin

633
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,090
who lives in that alley?

634
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,660
No.

635
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,100
I've never seen him.

636
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,610
Sir,

637
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,290
you can go

638
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,330
ask other people.

639
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,220
Thanks.

640
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,660
Chen Qingzhi,

641
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,220
we're the same.

642
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,060
We've lived a hard life.

643
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,740
Your wife was killed by the Divine.

644
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,220
They controlled Chen Chao

645
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,220
and used him to force you

646
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,570
into working undercover

647
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,020
in the Intelligence Services.

648
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,140
I know you have lived

649
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,530
in the fear of exposing

650
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,260
your identity

651
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,100
for years.

652
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,620
The only comfort for you

653
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,780
is to learn about what your son is doing.

654
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,420
Have you ever thought

655
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,490
about what the Divine would do

656
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,780
to Chen Chao

657
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,940
if they knew that

658
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,780
your cover was blown.

659
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,970
He doesn't know anything.

660
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,210
He has nothing to do with this.

661
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,780
Leave him alone!

662
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,540
Leave him alone!

663
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,660
Leave him alone.

664
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,380
I won't get him involved.

665
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,460
I am Chen Qingzhi.

666
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,540
Chen Chao is my son.

667
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,970
What else do you want to know?

668
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,580
I will tell you all.

669
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,900
I will tell you everything.

670
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,860
Any news?

671
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,410
I asked around at a few shops.

672
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,540
No one knows him.

673
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,940
You mentioned that

674
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,820
Kang Jin was staying

675
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,930
in Guanglin Inn.

676
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,810
Why did he stay there

677
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
if he has his own place?

678
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,970
Two explanations.

679
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,100
He was doing business

680
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,180
under the table

681
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,380
or he was protecting himself from trouble.

682
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,980
So strange.

683
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,260
How come no one here

684
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,100
has seen Kang Jin before?

685
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,580
He has a business

686
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,700
in the West.

687
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,370
He stays in Luoyang

688
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,620
only a few days every year.

689
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,930
Understandably,

690
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,970
his neighbors don't know him.

691
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:47,940
We must have

692
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,780
missed something.

693
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,020
How about we go back

694
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,250
and send more people here?

695
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,290
I will dig him out

696
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:53,900
for you

697
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,660
at all costs.

698
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,130
You just mentioned that

699
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,380
he stayed in Luoyang

700
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,580
only a few days every year.

701
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,820
I didn't tell you that.

702
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,220
He is mysterious.

703
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,340
How did you know?

704
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
A neighbor said so.

705
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
Mother, look.

706
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,940
Fish.

707
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,220
Mother, look down there.

708
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,930
Sir,

709
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,860
you just came over.

710
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,180
What else do you want to know?

711
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
Your neighbor is a merchant from the outlands.

712
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,010
Do you know him?

713
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,580
He asked me

714
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,660
the same question.

715
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,460
I don't know

716
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,780
the merchant you are looking for.

717
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,010
Kang Jin said

718
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,450
he gave his neighbors wine

719
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,900
every time he was back from the West.

720
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,020
Don't you know him?

721
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,690
Right.

722
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,420
I don't know about others

723
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,640
but I paid him

724
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,820
every time he offered me wine.

725
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,460
I didn't take advantage of him.

726
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,130
Kang Jin isn't doing

727
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,409
any wine business.

728
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,739
Madam,

729
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,460
please tell us the truth.

730
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,300
Money is everything.

731
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,500
You seduced my wife
because you have money, huh?

732
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,420
You can do whatever you want
because you are rich, huh?

733
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,980
You will pay for it.

734
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,500
You will pay for it.

735
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,790
[Kang Jin, merchant from Ke Tribe]

736
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
It's outlanders' clothes.

737
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,370
Here are some gold and jewelry.

738
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,500
I think they belong to Kang Jin.

739
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,460
Do you mean Kang Jin has an affair?

740
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,090
Kang Jin had no shame and seduced

741
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,570
my daughter-in-law.

742
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,420
He also packed his belongings

743
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,300
and wanted to leave with her.

744
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,210
My son found out about them.

745
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,930
My son lost his mind and...

746
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,540
He tied Kang up?

747
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,970
Miss,

748
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,340
my son was impulsive

749
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,090
but he isn't a bad person.

750
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,180
Please forgive him.

751
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,540
Don't arrest him.

752
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,420
Calm down, please.

753
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,140
Do you know where they are?

754
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,730
Don't move.

755
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,060
You!

756
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,810
You!

757
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,450
You!

758
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,200
Listen,

759
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,890
I'll end your life here!

760
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,490
Hua Qingzhi said that

761
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,660
Four Season Divine

762
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,450
had been managed

763
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,330
by Lord of Spring and Lady of Autumn

764
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,060
after Lord Freedom was arrested.

765
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,660
Moles and assassins from the Divine

766
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,530
and working in different places

767
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,300
were all assigned by Lady of Autumn.

768
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,850
She seems to have

769
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,650
a lot of power.

770
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,340
What did she

771
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,060
ask them to do?

772
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,210
The assassination in the south of Luoyang,

773
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,420
the killing in the Grand Court,

774
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,340
the murder of Chen Que and Agent Han,

775
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,540
and the attack on Sir Wu.

776
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,410
Did the 16th Night work for her?

777
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,900
She was only a killer

778
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,090
and operated under her command.

779
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,130
Hua Qingzhi

780
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,610
hid information and misled us

781
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,220
when the killers were operating.

782
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,410
Kang Jin,

783
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,460
I'll kill you now

784
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,820
and that promiscuous woman next!

785
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,580
You will meet in hell.
