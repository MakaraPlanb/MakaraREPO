[Episode 27]

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,660
Shen Fei!

5
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,260
Shen Fei!

6
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,500
My lady.

7
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,970
How do I look?

8
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,860
My lady, why are you dressed like this today?

9
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,180
It makes traveling easier.

10
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,980
I am dressed like a man

11
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,329
so that I can run errands for Hongyi.

12
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,540
You can leave the chores to the servants and me.

13
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,579
My lady, don't exhaust yourself.

14
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,600
As long as I can help Hongyi,

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,340
nothing will exhaust me.

16
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,980
My lady!

17
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,420
My lady!

18
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,500
Why are you out here?

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,740
My lady, where are you going?

20
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,380
I'll go with you.

21
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,620
The soup is still on the stove!

22
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,140
Keep an eye on it!

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,660
It's for Hongyi. Don't overcook it!

24
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,330
Go!

25
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,980
I've seen Tiantong's manuscript.

26
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,020
The bat guano

27
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,300
needs to be toasted with sticky rice

28
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,620
and ground into the finest granules.

29
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,690
We need realgar as well.

30
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,170
It is pungent.

31
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,700
I'll ask them to pack it separately.

32
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,540
Shen Fei,

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,100
buy some sandalwood at the west market.

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,690
Remember!

35
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,220
Only pick the dry ones.

36
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,860
Okay.

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,500
I'll come and get you after I'm done.

[Baili Mansion]

39
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,860
Let's go.

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,700
[Tiantong, a Taoist from Four Season Divine]

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,850
[Baili Mansion]

42
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,970
Gao Bingzhu!

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,610
Wake up!

44
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,579
Gao Bingzhu!

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,540
Wake up!

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,890
Wake up, Gao Bingzhu!

47
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,630
Gao Bingzhu!

48
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,990
Gao Bingzhu!

49
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,080
Wake up!

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,550
How are you feeling?

51
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,010
I am fine.

52
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,770
You scared me to death!

53
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,930
I am fine now.

54
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,590
Dai Zhou has been caught.

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,660
Someone wanted to kill him so badly.

56
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,380
It means he must know

57
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,640
something important.

58
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,900
My lady, rest assured!

59
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,960
Our pharmacy is century-old

60
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
and has been run for generations.

61
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,200
We won't sell

62
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,250
any adulterants.

63
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,460
Century-old?

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,820
Well, only a few years short.

65
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,330
Sir,

66
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,310
why is the bat guano different from
 what I bought last time?

67
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,070
That's impossible!

68
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,290
The bat guano sold here

69
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,680
is toasted by myself.

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,020
How could it be different?

71
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,040
Who are you?

72
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,510
Have I ever sold bat guano to you?

73
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,310
Have a look!

74
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,280
The granules are not fine enough.

75
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,670
It's not dark enough.

76
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,050
You clearly used aged sticky rice

77
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,270
when making it.

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,030
How could the ingredient be pure this way?

79
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,530
I've never heard that

80
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,659
one needs to distinguish

81
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,340
fresh rice from aged rice when toasting bat guano.

82
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,690
Get lost if you don't wanna buy stuff.

83
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,450
I have a customer here!

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,720
Listen to yourself!

85
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,820
Doing business is all about honesty.

86
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,540
I dedicate myself to Taoist alchemy.

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,890
I can tell if the ingredients are good 
at just a glance.

88
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,900
Your ingredients

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,120
might be good enough for ailments,

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,630
but if they're used to make elixirs,

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,150
nothing can come out of them

92
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,120
other than useless debris.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,660
I...

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,180
My ingredients are authentic.

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,410
Sir,

96
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,170
I won't have these, then.

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,510
-Take care.
-My lady!

98
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,820
My lady!

99
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,790
Do not listen to that lunatic!

100
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,220
The bat guano here

101
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,350
is of high quality.

102
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,400
This is not about money,

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,040
but the reputation of my pharmacy!

104
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,670
What?

105
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,650
Not only are you selling an adulterant,

106
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,740
but you're also forcing her to buy it!

107
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,290
You...

108
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,050
Your ingredients

109
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,840
are nothing compared to those

110
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,310
at Dong's Pharmacy, the top pharmacy in Luoyang.

111
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,520
Dong's Pharmacy?

112
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,240
My lady!

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,750
Take care!

114
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,130
My lady, don't go!

115
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,140
Your ingredients!

116
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,940
Well...

117
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,070
Sir!

118
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,670
Sir, wait for me!

119
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,150
Sir,

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,750
thank you for helping me back there.

121
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,980
My lady, it's quite alright.

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,150
You are too kind.

123
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,370
You don't see the vileness in people.

124
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,710
The pharmacies in the south market

125
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,890
all sell adulterants.

126
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,860
You won't find any good stuff

127
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,240
wandering around like this.

128
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,840
Sir, you mentioned

129
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,010
Dong's Pharmacy.

130
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,110
How should I get there?

131
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,830
I'm on my way to Dong's Pharmacy.

132
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,000
We can go there together.

133
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,390
I can give you some advice.

134
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,230
Thank you, sir.

135
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,500
Sir, this way...

136
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,290
How did you know

137
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,170
Taoist Tiantong?

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,640
How did you deceive the Crown Prince?

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,110
[Dai Zhou, a retainer in the Eastern Palace]

140
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,090
Go away.

141
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,930
Speak!

142
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,610
I didn't deceive him.

143
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,370
Taoist Tiantong

144
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,590
used to treat my illness.

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,310
We got to know each other in time.

146
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,490
He heard that the Crown Prince
 was interested in alchemy,

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,090
so he asked me to introduce him.

148
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,150
At first, I didn't know anything.

149
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,740
I just thought

150
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
he was trying to cozy up to the Crown Prince.

151
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,730
It was not until later did I find out

152
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,870
that he was actually after

153
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,130
Xuanwu's Pearls.

154
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,110
The caravan of the Ke Tribe sent

155
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,290
over half a ton of Xuanwu's Pearls,

156
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,720
but only one-fifth of them

157
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,860
made it to the Crown Prince.

158
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,000
The rest

159
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,179
were smuggled by Tiantong.

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,240
Why didn't you tell the Crown Prince earlier?

161
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,090
I took bribes.

162
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,490
So, I had to turn a blind eye from time to time.

163
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,610
Welcome, sir!

164
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,200
Sir,

165
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,170
have you seen

166
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,010
Lady Liu Ran today?

167
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,730
Lady Liu Ran?

168
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:52,780
She was

169
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,870
dressed like a man.

170
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,300
Did she come here to buy ingredients?

171
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,840
Yes.

172
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,860
She didn't buy anything and left.

173
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,460
She didn't buy anything?

174
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,630
Are you sure?

175
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,680
I am.

176
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,780
Which way did she go?

177
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,290
That way.

178
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,690
Thank you, sir.

179
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,830
After you knew

180
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,300
the caravan was ambushed

181
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,060
and Kang Jin and Kang Zhanbi were killed,

182
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,530
you realized that

183
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,210
the people behind Tiantong

184
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,850
were way more powerful than you had thought,

185
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,690
right?

186
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,350
Besides, you knew that after they killed Kang Jin

187
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,350
and Kang Zhanbi,

188
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,960
they'd come after you for sure.

189
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,430
Tell me.

190
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,320
How did you and Tiantong keep in contact?

191
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,060
If you want to live,

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,530
tell me everything now.

193
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,820
Quan Shan Fang.

194
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,890
He's got a deserted house there.

195
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,570
We always met there.

196
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,710
Madam Wu,

197
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,260
Dai Zhou serves the Crown Prince.

198
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,440
How about we take him back

199
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,700
and leave him to Sir Wu?

200
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,270
We fought with our lives

201
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,110
to bring him here.

202
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,740
You...

203
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,920
Dai Zhou,

204
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,230
let me ask you this.

205
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,070
Take him!

206
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:06,860
Yes, sir.

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,890
Dai Zhou will be safe

208
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,940
in the Interior Guard Services.

209
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,900
Let's go to the deserted house

210
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,780
he just mentioned.

211
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,790
Let's see if he is lying.

212
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,930
Okay.

213
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,540
Who did they get?

214
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,270
Dai Zhou, the retainer in the Eastern Palace.

215
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,330
Go on.

216
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,670
Dai Zhou admitted that

217
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,810
he's been taking advantage of his position

218
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,070
and taking many bribes

219
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,420
in the name of the Crown Prince.

220
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,300
This time,

221
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,230
he used the Crown Prince's interest in alchemy
 as an excuse

222
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,620
and forged identity documents

223
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,580
for a caravan from the West

224
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,060
to smuggle contraband and make a profit.

225
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,380
Dai Zhou is a retainer in the Eastern Palace

226
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,140
and trusted by the Crown Prince.

227
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,410
He committed misdeeds and broke the laws

228
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,510
in the name of the Eastern Palace.

229
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,150
The Crown Prince is left with two options.

230
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,780
Either,

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,460
he becomes Dai's accomplice,

232
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,800
or,

233
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,560
he deserts Dai Zhou.

234
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,010
Either way,

235
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,540
it'll take a heavy toll on the Eastern Palace.

236
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,620
How are you feeling?

237
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,300
Maybe we should go to a doctor first.

238
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,840
I am fine.

239
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,070
I just inhaled some toxic gas.

240
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,630
I'll be fine in a minute.

241
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,180
Gao Bingzhu,

242
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,200
you've changed.

243
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,190
You gave up on arresting Dai Zhou

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,910
to save those people.

245
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,840
The old you

246
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,400
would've never done that.

247
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,620
Dai Zhou

248
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,090
almost got away today.

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,740
It was my mistake.

250
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:59,200
♫It's been a rainy night in Luoyang♫

251
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,890
It was all thanks to you.

252
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,820
In fact, I think

253
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,990
the new you is great.

254
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:07,300
♫The thunder was cruelly deafening♫

255
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,640
You saved me last time.

256
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,150
I saved you today.

257
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,370
We can call it even.

258
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,610
♫We talked all night, trying to find the truth♫

259
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,680
♫Hidden among the high towers♫

260
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,710
♫How I wish fate will be in my favor♫

261
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,970
Madam Wu!

262
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,990
♫The blood has filled the city river♫

263
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,190
♫We are connected by the gentle flow♫

264
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,500
♫The truth has been shredded into pieces♫

265
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,640
♫The same as us, broken pieces♫

266
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,250
♫The Tower of Buddhist is the same as ever♫

267
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,950
♫What is it trying to tell us♫

268
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,490
♫Suddenly, I understand it all♫

269
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,430
Unfortunately, we were one minute too late,

270
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,530
and the person who released the toxic gas got away.

271
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,250
They had targeted

272
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,430
Dai Zhou long ago.

273
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,400
They saw me

274
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,570
when they arrived,

275
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,710
so they wanted to kill me, too.

276
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,010
From Kang Zhanbi to Dai Zhou...

277
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,520
They've had everything planned out.

278
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,660
They will always be

279
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,000
one step ahead of us.

280
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,430
Besides, these people

281
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,570
are all connected with Xuanwu's Pearls.

282
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,390
What do you think

283
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,320
the Clan wants those for?

284
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,520
She's gone missing.

285
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,870
I've checked all the stores.

286
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,090
I've searched everywhere I can think of.

287
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,430
Nobody has seen her.

288
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,630
Send people to search the south market,

289
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,850
especially the dark allies and riverbanks.

290
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,860
I'll ask Madam Wu for help.

291
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,490
Yes.

292
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,590
My lord,

293
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,720
a letter to you.

294
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,430
To save Liu Ran,

295
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,230
come to 7 Dun Hua Fang, 4th Ave.

296
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,830
Come alone. Do not report to the authorities.

297
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,010
Who sent this?

298
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,270
A Taoist priest.

299
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,530
He left this note and went away.

300
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,430
What's your relationship with

301
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,100
Taoist Tiantong of Yuncui Temple?

302
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,860
He is my teacher.

303
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,080
Where is he now?

304
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,160
Do you wanna tell me now,

305
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,790
or wait after

306
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,800
I bring you back to the Interior Guard Services?

307
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,440
I really don't know.

308
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,990
He brought a group of people here

309
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,540
and destroyed all the things overnight.

310
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,350
They all left in the morning.

311
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,610
Where to?

312
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,090
I heard him mention

313
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,310
the North Mountain in the suburb.

314
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,450
He has a house there.

315
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,000
He asked us to go there first.

316
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,120
Are you Baili Hongyi?

317
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,330
Get in.

318
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,140
How can I get to 7 Dun Hua Fang, 4 Ave.?

319
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,530
There's no such place.

320
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,530
No?

321
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,330
No.

322
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,720
[North Mountain House]

323
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,870
[North Mountain House, Meeting Point for Four Season Clan]

324
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,280
Stay still!

325
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:31,950
Don't move!

326
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:32,790
Liu Ran?

327
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,260
Hongyi!

328
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,680
Don't move!

329
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,940
Stay still!

330
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,240
Hongyi!

331
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,380
Don't move!

332
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,650
Hongyi!

333
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,350
Why do you have my manuscript?

334
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,650
Who gave it to you?

335
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,780
What are you after?

336
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,430
I'm here all alone

337
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,480
per your request.

338
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,190
Let her go!

339
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,250
You were buying ingredients to make elixirs.

340
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,300
Why?

341
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,560
Let her go first!

342
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,829
Hongyi!

343
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,920
Hongyi!

344
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,300
Your life is at my disposal,

345
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,280
and yet you're bargaining with me?

346
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,960
Baili Hongyi,

347
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,380
I'll ask you again.

348
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,350
Why do you have

349
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,030
my manuscript?

350
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,500
Let her go first!

351
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,750
As someone who's from a noble family,

352
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,050
it's rare that

353
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,270
you're so courageous.

354
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,080
Well, if you're not gonna tell me...

355
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,190
What are you doing?

356
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,500
Let go of me!

357
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,380
Let go of me!

358
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,230
Let go!

359
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,040
What are you doing?

360
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,350
Don't you touch her!

361
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,270
Don't touch her!

362
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,550
Stop!

363
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,470
Don't touch her!

364
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,410
I'll tell you everything!

365
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,710
I've got the manuscript.

366
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Let go of me!

367
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

368
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,150
No need for formalities.

369
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,470
Her Majesty has ordered me

370
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,770
to meet her immediately.

371
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,500
Your Highness, do you know

372
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,680
why she needs to see me

373
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,200
on such short notice?

374
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,980
Shenxing, you have eyes everywhere.

375
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,240
Why play dumb with me?

376
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,490
Your Highness, I heard that

377
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,580
you've been resting in the Eastern Palace

378
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,880
and connecting with your spirituality.

379
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,030
Won't you feel constrained

380
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,760
in this outfit?

381
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,720
The Crown Prince's Mianfu clothing
is decorated with nine symbols.

382
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,780
Shenxing, if you like it so much,

383
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,010
you can ask Her Majesty to give you one.

384
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,430
I dare not to have this

385
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,450
unrealistic thought.

386
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,400
Don't think

387
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,410
I don't know

388
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,840
what is on your mind!

389
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,560
If you hadn't made

390
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,540
those great plans behind my back,

391
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,310
we wouldn't have become like this, would we?

392
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,440
What I have done

393
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,870
is nothing compared with

394
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,680
the things you've done, Your Highness.

395
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,140
You...

396
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,780
I do need to give you a piece of advice,
 Your Highness.

397
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,720
You need to thoroughly vet

398
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,740
your servants.

399
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,300
Find someone with a clean record.

400
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,990
Or, you'll get yourself in trouble.

401
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,050
Wu Shenxing!

402
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,720
Your Highness,

403
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,150
Her Majesty wants to see you.

404
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,840
A friend gave the manuscript

405
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,550
to me

406
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,190
and asked me to

407
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,070
study it.

408
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,290
Who?

409
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,940
Madam Wu of the Interior Guard Services.

410
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Is this a trick to get me to 
mess with the interior guards?

411
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,270
Ask him if you don't believe me.

412
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,330
He tried to kill me

413
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,720
and Madam Wu saved me.

414
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,340
What did the Services learn?

415
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,980
I am not sure.

416
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,790
You had the guts to meet me alone.

417
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,380
You must've had a fallback plan.

418
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,780
So, you're backed
 by the Interior Guard Services, right?

419
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,720
As long as you tell me the truth,

420
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,980
I won't hurt her.

421
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,860
Let her go first.

422
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,090
Liu Ran has nothing to do with this.

423
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,300
If she hears

424
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,230
our conversation,

425
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,490
you'll never let her go.

426
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,430
Hongyi, I am not leaving.

427
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,310
Hongyi!

428
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,910
Hongyi, I am not leaving!

429
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,750
Hongyi!

430
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,170
Go!

431
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,300
Hongyi, I don't wanna leave!

432
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,940
Let go of me! Hongyi!

433
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,940
I've been trying to make the Thunder.

434
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,100
I've studied your manuscript.

435
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,400
So, I know that

436
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,120
you'll never let me walk out of here alive.

437
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,300
Guess

438
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,900
what I will do.

439
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,460
Who else knows about this?

440
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,900
Nobody at the moment.

441
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,340
However, now that I've gone missing,

442
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,430
the interior guards will soon

443
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,400
search for me.

444
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,660
Everywhere I've been,

445
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,500
everything I've done,

446
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,010
the books I've read, the handwriting I've left,

447
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,520
the food I've eaten, and the place I've stayed...

448
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,370
They'll leave no stone unturned.

449
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,760
How long

450
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,600
do you think it'll take them

451
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,990
to find the Thunder Formula?

452
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,180
Where would I hide

453
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,780
all the relevant documents?

454
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,050
Issuing identity documents in private

455
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,780
and smuggling contraband...

456
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,050
You're the Crown Prince!

457
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,410
You should be so proud of yourself!

458
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,740
Get up!

459
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,300
Explain everything to me.

460
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,930
I thought

461
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,990
I could make an elixir

462
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,620
and give it to you as a gift

463
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,220
on the Ceremony of Light

464
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,360
as a token for good health

465
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,580
and longevity.

466
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,380
Who'd have thought...

467
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,160
It was my fault!

468
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,600
I was a poor judge of character

469
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,990
and was taken advantage of by Dai Zhou,
 that cunning rat!

470
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,400
That's why I committed all the misdeeds.

471
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,710
You've not changed a bit.

472
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,560
You always blame others

473
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,830
for your own wrongdoings.

474
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,850
I dare not to.

475
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,910
I was just trying to be a good son.

476
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,340
Your Majesty, please trust me!

477
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,060
Do you really think

478
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,150
I am too old and foolish

479
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,410
to know anything?

480
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,100
Answer me this.

481
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,670
Why was the Eastern Palace

482
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,270
on fire out of the blue?

483
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,540
Even the furnace went on fire.

484
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,690
How dare you claim that

485
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,580
the elixirs you make are for good health?

486
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,260
If I did take those elixirs,

487
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,160
maybe

488
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,600
I'd be long gone before even realizing
 they're harmful.

489
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,540
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

490
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,260
That was not my intention.

491
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,350
Whether you did it intentionally or not,

492
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,740
all this happened

493
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,480
because you were misbehaving

494
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,030
and didn't get your subordinate in line.

495
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
From now on,

496
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,650
you shall stay in the Eastern Palace

497
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,910
and reflect on your behavior.

498
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,630
You're forbidden to see anyone

499
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,190
before the Ceremony of Light.

500
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,540
Yes.

501
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,120
The Crown Prince

502
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,610
should be the future emperor,

503
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,470
not some spiritual being 
obsessed with immortality.

504
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,730
Tell me your plan.

505
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
Send Liu Ran back first.

506
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,010
I will tell her

507
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,390
where I kept the Thunder Formula

508
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,190
and other relevant documents.

509
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,910
As long as she gets back safely

510
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,260
and hides the documents,

511
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,020
the Interior Guard Services

512
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,530
will not find out about your secret.

513
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,540
How can I believe you?

514
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,180
As long as you've got me,

515
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,950
Liu Ran will keep the secret for sure.

516
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,470
She knows that if she misspeaks,

517
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,700
I will die.

518
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,310
You almost tricked me.

519
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,760
How could the secret of the Thunder

520
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,810
be that easily

521
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,910
figured out?

522
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,420
You know nothing about Taoist alchemy.

523
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,970
No matter how talented you are,

524
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,740
it's not impossible for you

525
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,700
to reveal the secret

526
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,580
within a few days.

527
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,560
If you can't figure out the secret,

528
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,900
the documents you mentioned

529
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,410
will be nothing but trash.

530
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,440
So what if the Interior Guard Services found them?

531
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,120
Cut off one of

532
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Liu Ran's hands.

533
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,690
Yes.

534
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,860
Wait!

535
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,990
Take me to your alchemy room.

536
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,840
I'll prove myself to you.

537
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,900
Based on the description of the pharmacy owner,

538
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,830
we drew a sketch

539
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,710
of the abductor.

540
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,470
Have you seen this guy?

541
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,070
No.

542
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,920
Now that you've known what he looks like,

543
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,970
does that mean you can catch him?

544
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,030
We still don't know who he is.

545
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,540
Besides, he's left no trace.

546
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,800
We need some time.

547
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,070
If any of you sees him anywhere,

548
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,160
let us know immediately.

549
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,750
Let's go.

550
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,630
Thank you.

551
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,520
What should we do, Uncle Baili?

552
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,160
Lady Liu Ran has been missing for half a day.

553
00:26:59,410 --> 00:26:59,920
I...

554
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,770
Uncle Baili, I'll go find Madam Wu.

555
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,650
Among all my sons,

556
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,300
Tao was my favorite.

557
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,780
Unfortunately, he died so young.

558
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,510
Yu is smart,

559
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,500
but he was deceived by evildoers

560
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,230
and ruined his own life.

561
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,960
The rest of them...

562
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,960
The Crown Prince merely
 got his judgment clouded.

563
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,820
His judgment has been clouded
 for half of his life.

564
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,060
Fortunately, you reported him to me.

565
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,290
Otherwise, who knows

566
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,430
what trouble he'll get himself into?

567
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

568
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,710
I can't take all the credit.

569
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,060
It was Wu Youjue

570
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,110
who was brave and determined

571
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,580
that caught Dai Zhou,

572
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,150
the retainer in the Eastern Palace in time.

573
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,400
Youjue is a good kid.

574
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,660
Tell me.

575
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,500
How shall I reward him?

576
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,480
That rebel Song Liang was arrested.

577
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,090
The position of Minister of War

578
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,940
has been vacant.

579

581
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,420
I need to be discreet.

582
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,410
I wanted to appoint someone in the Court,

583
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,730
but I couldn't find anyone suitable.

584
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,910
So, I didn't proceed with it.

585
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,390
Youjue has been leading
 the Interior Guard Services for years.

586
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,790
He's been devoted and hardworking.

587
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,070
Your Majesty, you entrusted your safety to him.

588
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,660
I think you can also entrust

589
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,840
the safety of our country

590
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,850
to him as well.

591
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,020
I've never doubted Youjue's loyalty.

592
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,880
It's just that he's been in poor health.

593
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,710
I'm worried that he'd be worn out.

594
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,520
Your Majesty, you're so considerate.

595
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,510
Prove yourself.

596
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,400
Shen Fei will go to Madam Wu

597
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,080
once he can't find me.

598
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,840
I have to stall these people

Why would you consider

606
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,740
these books of heterodoxy

607
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,260
that have nothing to do with politics

608

classics?

609
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,850
They're not books of heterodoxy.

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,780
to study politics and economics

Be careful, Hongyi!

695
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,690
According to that Taoist disciple,

696
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,610
this should be it.

697
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,680

That's not our main concern.

700
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,180
The main problem is that

701
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,810
we don't know

702
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,900
where Hongyi and Liu Ran are kept.

703
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,290
If we barge in like this,

704
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm afraid they'll kill Hongyi and Liu Ran

705
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,100
before we can even fight our way

706
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,980
through the guards.

707
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,250
Should I arrest one of them

708
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,050
for interrogation?

709
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,020
-No.
-No.

710
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,280
If we act recklessly,

711
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,590
we'll startle them.

712
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,550
Since when do we

713
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,770
take orders from you?

714
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,320
Hold on!

715
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,330

717
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,180
I am all ears.

718
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,310
I don't think

719
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,790
you can figure out where Baili Hongyi is kept

720
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,670
just by watching over here.

721
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,130
We need to find a way

722
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,100
to let Hongyi know

723
