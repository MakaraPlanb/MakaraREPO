[Order for the inner guards. Take in the father and daughter from Lianshan]

585
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,080
A few days ago, we received an order.

586
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,280
A pair of father and daughter

587
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,890
came from Lianshan to capital to tip off.

588
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,770
The soldiers of Weizhou

589

were supposed to escort them to the inner guards.

590
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,240
But when Li Chun arrived at the Longmen Wharf,

591
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,290
he found out that the cabin of the escort team

592
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,330
was empty.

593
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,000

has any informers.

595
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,760

an informer

597
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,840

This is the first time

623

I've heard something like this.

Have you heard of it?

626
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,110
I only know the copper mine in Lianshan,

627
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,590
which is very famous.

628
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,880
Lianshan mutton is also delicious.

Not only that,

633
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,990

634
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,030
It is dangerous.

You are right.

636
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,630
In short, the journey from Lianshan to Luoyang

637
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,040
is not easy.

638

640

Why do you look for me?

When the mutton arrives in Luoyang

646
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,040
it becomes a delicacy.

647
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,390
But when people arrive in Luoyang, they die.

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,150
