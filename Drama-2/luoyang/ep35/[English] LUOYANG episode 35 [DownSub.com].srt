[Luoyang]

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,650
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,630
The chaos in Luoyang

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,030
have exerted a large burden on you.

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,310
I am only doing my job.

7
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,910
I dare not to slack off.

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,870
Will you be able to shoulder

9
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,509
yet another burden?

10
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,190
I don't understand it.

11
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,030
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,910
I've been thinking

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,830
if I should replace the current Lord Chu

14
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,350
with someone else.

15
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,140
You are clever.

16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,430
I've always thought highly of you.

17
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,390
I am deeply grateful

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,510
for your grace, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,590
Is that a yes?

20
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,470
Your Majesty, you said that

21
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,270
the Intelligence Services is your 'ears and eyes'

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,750
and the Interior Guard Services is your 'arms.'

23
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,190
I've been leading
 the Interior Guard Services for years.

24
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,260
I may have made mistakes,

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,310
but I've always been loyal.

26
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,110
All I've ever wanted is to make you happy,
 Your Majesty.

27
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,070
So, that's a no, then?

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,829
How could the two Services

29
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,230
be led by the same person?

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,630
I trust you.

31
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,070
I dare not fail your trust, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,790
It's just that I'm not capable

33
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,260
of managing the two Services all at once.

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,940
There are many talents in the royal family.

35
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,390
Please, Your Majesty,

36
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,830
find another one to take charge of it.

37
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,550
Don't be nervous!

38
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,470
It was the King of Jin who said

39
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,190
that the Intelligence Services

40
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,470
should be managed by you.

41
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,790
I was merely

42
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,710
curious about

43
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,390
what you think of it.

44
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,070
His Highness is too kind.

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,870
I am utterly grateful.

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,190
However, I have to respectfully decline the offer.

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,310
You saw it!

48
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,510
The rice is sold out!

49
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,070
I don't have any left for you.

50
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,210
[Sold out]

51
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,910
It's sold out.

52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,190
There's no use standing here.

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,829
Look!

54
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,870
[Rice]

55
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,390
Alright.

56
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,230
It's sold out!

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,110
Nothing left.

58
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,110
Didn't you see the 'Sold Out' sign?

59
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,750
We've got no rice left.

60
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,310
Go back!

[Rice]

62
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,390
No new rice.

63
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,070
All gone!

64
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,230
Guys!

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,670
Guys, hear me out!

66
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,149
Hear me out, guys!

67
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,029
We've sold out all the grain.

68
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,230
Please leave, guys!

69
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:19,870
Go back!

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,510
Why should I

71
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,070
hear you out?

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,950
That's all you wanna say?

73
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,670
Go back!

74
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,710
Everything's sold out!

75
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,950
I've waited four hours for nothing.

76
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,270
I didn't get a single grain of rice,

77
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,150
and you're telling me it's sold out?

78
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,590
Yeah!

79
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,690
[Sold out]

80
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,390
Yeah!

81
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,990
Why would I lie to you?

82
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,550
It's true.

83
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,630
This is such a big rice shop!

84
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,909
How come there's no stockpile?

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,590
You must have something left.

86
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,590
[Sold out]

87
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,670
Yes, you must be lying!

88
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,470
Yeah!

89
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,590
We don't have anything left.

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,150
It's only been three days,

91
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,909
and all the grain in over 300 rice shops
 are out of stock.

92
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,830
Shops are smashed and robbed.

93
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,909
In the south market alone,

94
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,830
there were 13 shops robbed.

95
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
I still don't understand

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,980
what good can the Clan get

97
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,390
from all this other than

98
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,710
starving the people of Luoyang?

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,030
I'm worried about another thing.

100
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,670
Her Majesty summoned all the officials

101
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,910
to discuss matters on Hanjia Granary today,

102
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,670
except you, my lord.

103
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,870
My lord,

104
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,190
you've been Lord Chu for years.

105
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,710
This has never happened before.

106
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,590
Open the door!

107
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:33,960
[Rice]

108
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,990
Guys, don't panic!

109
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,670
Her Majesty has ordered officials

110
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,350
to transport new grain via canals to Luoyang

111
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,830
in ten days.

112
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,390
Ten days?

113
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,190
Ten days?

114
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,390
We'd run out of food by then.

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,710
It's too long!

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,830
However,

117
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,070
if anyone takes advantage of the situation

118
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,030
and commits misdeeds,

119
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,870
they'll be punished by the Grant Court.

120
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,670
[Sold out]

121
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,790
Hanjia Granary was blown up.

122
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,710
The Intelligence Services
 failed its duty to supervise.

123
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,750
Her Majesty is likely to punish our Services first

124
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,830
if she is instigated.

125
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,990
If worst comes to worst,

126
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,590
Lord Chu will be replaced,

127
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,990
and the entire Services will be
 in someone else's control.

128
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,790
Agent Gao!

129
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,510
Baitan,

130
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,230
what Bingzhu said

131
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,820
is not just some scare story,
 given the current situation.

132
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,790
My lord, you've been managing the Services
 for years.

133
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,470
You know everything about Luoyang.

134
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,470
Four Season Clan would like nothing more

135
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,350
than you being forced to abdicate
 from leadership.

136
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:14,950
Baitan,

137
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,500
get prepared, and let's see Her Majesty together.

138
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,390
My lord!

139
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,350
Go!

140
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,430
Go!

141
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,790
Yes.

142
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,789
Gao Bingzhu,

143
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,179
I have a favor to ask.

144
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,790
Take care of our Services.

145
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,590
[Interior Guard Services]

146
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,350
I saw him.

147
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,390
Who?

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,830
My brother.

149
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,590
Baili Kuanren is still alive.

150
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,310
Where is he?

151
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,190
He left.

152
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,630
I didn't expect him to come back to Luoyang.

153
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,470
Do you really not know

154
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,910
or are you pretending?

155
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,510
He joined Four Season Clan

156
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,750
and he's Lord of Spring now.

157
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,910
Don't talk nonsense!

158
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,110
How could he ever join Four Season Clan?

159
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,350
How could he be Lord of Spring?

160
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,070
He told me himself.

161
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,430
If that's the truth,

162
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,030
then, it was me

163
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,150
that brought Luoyang

164
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,310
into chaos.

165
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,990
Now that it's come to this,

166
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,470
I need to tell you something.

167
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,060
Follow me.

168
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,750
[Sincerely, Baili Yan]

169
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,150
Aged grains?

170
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,850
[Sincerely, Baili Yan]

171
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,430
This is my father's handwriting.

172
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,750
Indeed.

173
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,550
Back then, Her Majesty ordered

174
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,790
to exile your brother,

175
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,910
which was no different than killing him.

176
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,910
So, your father

177
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,750
wrote me a letter overnight

178
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,390
and begged me to

179
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,270
save your brother's life.

180
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,390
Kuanren was like a brother to me.

181
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,070
How could I

182
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,350
stand aside and watch him die?

183
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,670
So, we came up with a plan

184
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,030
to deceive Her Majesty by faking his death.

185
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,550
Then,

186
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,590
your brother fled to Chang'an

187
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,950
and changed his name.

188
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,590
He swore that

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,150
he'd never return to Luoyang.

190
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,270
Madam Wu!

191
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,470
Madam Wu!

192
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,750
Chen Zhuo, the director of Hanjia Granary,

193
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,350
hanged himself at home this morning.

194
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,230
We found a large number of valuables

195
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,350
of questionable origin at his home.

196
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,310
He was bought by the Clan, too.

197
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,350
According to his family,

198
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,750
Chen Zhuo met with Li Beiqi

199
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,790
before Hanjia Granary was blown up.

200
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,070
Then, you never met him ever again.

201
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,910
How could I ever meet him again?

202
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,430
Deceiving Her Majesty

203
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,870
is a felony!

204
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,190
I don't suppose your father

205
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,470
told you anything about it

206
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,750
when he died.

207
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,990
Naturally,

208
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,990
I had to keep my mouth shut as well.

209
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,150
Unexpectedly, your brother saw you

210
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,110
and told you that he's now

211
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,110
Lord of Spring of Four Season Clan.

212
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,380
What on earth has happened to him over the years?

213
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,910
Anyway, your brother is alive

214
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,750
because I saved him.

215
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,230
So, all the sins he's committed are related to me.

216
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,190
I promise I'll catch him and ask him
 to explain everything.

217
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,150
Hongyi, remember this.

218
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,710
You can't tell anyone

219
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,990
that your brother

220
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,030
is still alive

221
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,670
and has become a lord of Four Season Clan.

222
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,310
If Her Majesty ever finds out,

223
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,110
it'd be the death penalty for the whole family line.

224
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,150
You, Liu Ran,

225
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,110
and hundreds of others in the Baili family...

226
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,910
All of you will be killed!

227
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,850
[Interior Guard Services]

228
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,710
Brother!

229
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,470
I saw Baili Hongyi walking out.

230
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,670
Was he here for you?

231
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,420
He needed to know something.

232
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,150
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,270
I found these among the exhibits

234
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,030
collected from Hanjia Granary.

235
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,630
Brother, look.

236
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,670
Any problem?

237
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,830
These grains

238
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,190
are not cracked by the explosion.

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,630
They're old rotten grains.

240
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,390
Hanjia Granary is the largest granary
 in the country.

241
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,390
Why would there be rotten grains there?

242
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,710
I think Four Season Clan had replaced
 quality grains

243
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,980
with spoiled ones before the explosion.

244
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,270
So, the grains in the Granary
 weren't damaged in the explosion.

245
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,950
Four Season Clan have them.

246
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,860
Get a carriage.

247
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,190
I need to report it to Her Majesty now.

248
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,870
Yes.

249
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,670
My lord,

250
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,590
Her Majesty knows how much effort

251
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,070
you've put into our Services over the years.

252
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,780
She will never blame you

253
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,110
just because of calumny.

254
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,510
Baitan,

255
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,590
you don't need to comfort me.

256
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,150
My lord, someone's in the way.

257
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,630
My lord!

258
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,710
I will leave Luoyang in a moment.

259
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,470
I am here to bid farewell to you.

260
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,190
It's fine.

261
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,830
I'll be right back.

262
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,910
My lord!

263
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,830
Peipei, what are you doing here?

264
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,110
Such a terrible incident

265
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,190
occurred at Hanjia Granary.

266
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,990
The entire Luoyang is in chaos.

267
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,460
I am only a woman.

268
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,470
I may not survive here.

269
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,470
So, I have to leave Luoyang.

270
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,630
However,

271
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,950
I was worried about your safety,

272
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,750
so I got a safety charm for you.

273
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:13,910
I hope...

274
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,430
I hope you can keep it with you.

275
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,310
It'll bring you fortune and longevity.

276
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,950
Also, when you see it, you can remember

277
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,710
that far away from Luoyang, I am thinking about you.

278
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,670
How did you know my carriage
 would be on this route?

279
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,230
I am here...

280
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,270
My lord, danger!

281
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,310
[Safety charm]

282
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,790
My lord!

283
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,510
My lord!

284
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,090
[Safety charm]

285
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,150
My lord!

286
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,030
My lord!

287
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,030
My lord!

288
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,950
My lord!

289
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,070
My lord!

290
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,550
Help!

291
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,830
Help!

292
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,710
My lord!

293
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,350
Help!

294
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,710
Help!

295
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,910
You mean that the grain at Hanjia Granary

296
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,630
wasn't damaged by the fire,

297
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,390
but transferred to

298
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,830
Four Season Clan.

299
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,870
Chen Zhuo, director of Hanjia Granary,

300
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,270
and interior guard Li Beiqi

301
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,150
swapped the grain.

302
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,750
I was negligent of it.

303
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,270
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

304
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,910
Your Majesty,

305
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,150
the King of East River was attacked
 on his way here

306
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,190
by Yuwen Peipei, the top entertainer

307
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,910
of Hong Xiao Fang.

308
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,510
She ran away right after the attack.

309
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,510
All the officers are searching for her.

310
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,190
Losers!

311
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,510
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

312
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,110
Your Majesty,

313
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,390
His Highness

314
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,390
is in critical condition.

315
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,510
Your Majesty!

316
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,470
Do you know who the King of East River is?

317
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,550
His Highness is the grandson of Your Majesty

318
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,950
and the nephew of the Crown Prince.

319
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,750
He's also the leader of the Intelligence Services.

320
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,190
He's Lord Chu.

321
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,390
Luoyang has been in chaos

322
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,910
due to the negligence of the Intelligence Services.

323
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,470
Now, the powerful Lord Chu

324
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,550
was attacked on the street.

325
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,710
The Intelligence Services

326
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,140
has become weak

327
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,790
and susceptible.

328
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,390
It's become useless!

329
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,230
Sir Wu,

330
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,150
you said that the two Services

331
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,590
can't be led by the same person.

332
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,510
However, I'm now left

333
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,070
with no other option.

334
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,710
Wu Youjue,

335
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,310
take my order!

336
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,340
I am all ears, Your Majesty.

337
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,990
I command you

338
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,470
to take over the Intelligence Services
 immediately.

339
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,510
You'll remain the leader of 
the Interior Guard Services.

340
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,310
All the militia in Luoyang

341
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,670
will be under your command.

342
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,150
Destroy Four Season Clan as soon as possible

343
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,030
and find the grain stolen from Hanjia Granary.

344
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,550
Order from Her Majesty!

346
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,110
Lord Chu was attacked by evildoers

347
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,430
and is now severely injured.

348
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,270
Wu Youjue of the Interior Guard Services

349
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,790
will take over the Intelligence Services
 by order of Her Majesty.

350
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,590
The entire Intelligence Services

351
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,430
shall assist Sir Wu

352
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,150
in investigating the case

353
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,310
of Four Season Clan swapping grain
 of Hanjia Granary.

354
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,590
Accept the order!

355
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,630
The two services have never worked together.

356
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,470
Now, we'll be led by the Interior Guard Services?

357
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,110
Why is that?

358
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,590
Why are you not accepting the order?

359
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,510
Do you want to disobey Her Majesty?

360
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,390
According to the order,

361
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,390
the grain at Hanjia Granary

362
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,110
was swapped by Four Season Clan.

363
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,750
Do you have evidence?

364
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,550
Me taking over the Intelligence Services
 is all the evidence you need.

365
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,230
How could his words be considered evidence?

366
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,030
Nonsense.

367
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,310
This makes no sense.

368
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,990
The Interior Guard Services
 is the 'arms' of Her Majesty.

369
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,390
Yes.

370
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,630
We're the 'eyes and ears.'

371
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,030
It was Her Majesty's order that
 Sir Wu should take over our Services.

372
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,910
Your Highness.

373
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,270
Thank you, Sir Wu.

374
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,270
It's the King of East River...

375
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,230
Everyone,

376
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,590
I am Lord Chu of the Intelligence Services.

377
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,350
Lord Chu?

378
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,830
He's Lord Chu?

379
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,910
He's Lord Chu?

380
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,790
He usually wears a mask.

381
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,430
I've finally known who he is.

382
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,270
I've worked with all of you for years.

383
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,390
Today, my identity was exposed

384
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,510
and I was attacked.

385
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,790
I've failed my job.

386
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,870
Now, Sir Wu will replace me

387
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,780
as the new Lord Chu.

388
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,990
I hope you can

389
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,030
fully cooperate with him

390
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,910
and find out the conspiracy

391
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,590
planned by Four Season Clan.

392
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,110
My lord!

393
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,870
My lord!

394
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,670
Accept the order!

395
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,590
The Intelligence Services
 accepts Her Majesty's order.

396
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,630
Guys,

397
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,470
I took over the Intelligence Services

398
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,190
not to take full control.

399
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,270
At the moment,

400
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,630
Four Season Clan has ruined our capital!

401
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,910
The two Services need to

402
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,100
work together and fight against the enemy.

403
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,830
You've all seen it.

404
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,990
His Highness was attacked

405
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,470
and is now severely injured.

406
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,230
I, on the other hand, am not familiar

407
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,590
with how your Services works.

408
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,910
So, I need all of you

409
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,670
to help me.

410
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,910
Now,

411
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,270
I need someone who knows

412
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,110
how the Services works well

413
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,190
to take the lead.

414
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,670
Gao Bingzhu,

415
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,390
I will give this job

416
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,550
to you.

417
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,670
Four Season Clan is coming right after us.

418
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,710
We don't have

419
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,350
much time.

420
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,190
After Hanjia Granary was ruined,

421
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,270
not much grain reserve is left.

422
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,430
Rumors began to spread

423
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,270
that the people of Luoyang
would suffer from starvation.

424
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,830
Her Majesty ordered the palace guards

425
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,750
to destroy the hideout of Four Season Clan.

426
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,790
However, the hideout had already been evacuated.

427
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,470
Four Season Clan left no trace.

428
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,030
Ten days later,

429
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,310
a famine occurred in Luoyang.

430
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,790
The whole city was in a panic.

431
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,470
Civilians went on streets to rob grain shops,

432
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,390
causing frequent riots.

433
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,350
All of a sudden,

434
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,710
the capital was engulfed in a new crisis.

435
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,470
Give me that!

436
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:33,910
Give me!

437
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,670
It's mine!

438
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,950
My lord, agents of the Intelligence Services
 are all over Luoyang.

439
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,950
Wouldn't we put ourselves at risk,

440
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,990
showing up like this?

441
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,550
You're overthinking it.

442
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,630
They can't even take care of themselves now.

443
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,670
They won't have time for us.

444
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,590
Give it!

445
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,630
Stop!

446
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,500
Have you done what I asked you to do?

447
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,270
I've sent the message.

448
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,380
Once it's dark,

449
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,670
we can take action.

450
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:16,830
Let me ask you.

451
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,070
You've worked for Lady of Autumn for a long time.

452
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,830
What's the biggest difference between us two?

453
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,390
Don't worry!

454
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,630
Just speak your mind.

455
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,230
Lady of Autumn was straightforward and volatile.

456
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,950
She was not as friendly as you.

457
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,310
Tell you what.

458
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,910
Her biggest issue was that

459
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,870
she underestimated human nature.

460
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,910
She thought that once she blew up
 the Heavenly Temple with the Thunder,

461
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,950
all the people in Luoyang would be intimidated,

462
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,270
and we could establish authority.

463
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,390
Unfortunately,

464
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,390
even when she was dying,
 she couldn't understand that

465
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,110
human nature is a thousand times more powerful
 than the Thunder.

466
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,790
People have been living in peace

467
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,390
for so long in this glorious capital.

468
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,150
They've long forgotten what panic feels like.

469
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,870
Before I destroyed Hanjia Granary,

470
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,990
I asked our people in the Court

471
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,670
to cover things up for me.

472
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,550
No one had even noticed

473
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,630
what we were planning.

474
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,540
So, no one was well-prepared

475
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,220
for that sudden damage.

476
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,130
[The Customs Office]

477
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,230
Naturally, it'd bring chaos to people.

478
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,430
Once human nature was challenged,

479
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,870
we'd have tons of opportunities.

480
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,990
Look!

481
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,990
The seed I sowed

482
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,630
has finally started to sprout.

483
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,110
Kuanren once said that

484
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,470
if anything happened to him,

485
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,390
I could ask you for help.

486
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,550
Now, he's gotten himself in grave trouble.

487
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,870
Sir Wu, you're the only one who can save him.

488
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,370
[Sincerely, Baili Yan]

489
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,990
The Baili family is utterly grateful.

490
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,790
We will repay your kindness

491
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,830
with all that we have.

492
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,590
Sincerely, Baili Yan.

493
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,580
The Baili family

494
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,150
started off as ordinary folks.

495
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,430
You're the second generation.

496
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,070
Your brother died young.

497
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,030
You're not worldly at all.

498
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,710
Hongyi,

499
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,430
my son,

500
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,310
is an adult now and about to get married.

501
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,830
[The Ancestral Tablets of the Baili Family]

502
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,670
He'll extend the family line.

503
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,350
Dear ancestors,

504
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,990
please bless my son.

505
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,710
Please bless the Baili family.

506
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,270
Our family is like the cards we hold.

507
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,030
You pull one card wrong,

508
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,830
and everything will change.

509
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,510
What happened to your brother

510
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,150
shall be a lesson to you.

511
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,550
Women don't get involved in politics.

512
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,990
Officials don't overthrow the ruler.

513
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,910
The ruler should be capable and ethical.

514
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,430
They should put their words into action.

515
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,150
The world is turned upside down!

516
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,030
Kuanren!

517
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,510
Am I wrong?

518
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,190
Back then, Her Majesty ordered

519
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,420
to exile your brother.

520
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,470
So, we came up with a plan

521
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,790
to deceive Her Majesty by faking his death.

522
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,030
Weeds are all over the field.

523
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,790
We need to set them to fire!

524
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,710
She's only an ugly duckling,
 but she thinks she's become a swan.

525
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,110
Hongyi, remember this.

526
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,020
You can't tell anyone that your brother is alive

527
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,590
and has become a lord of Four Season Clan.

528
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,350
I couldn't be an official due to deformities.

529
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,900
In the world of politics...

530
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,230
Those who agree to this rule

531
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,910
shall be killed!

532
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,750
...One wrong word...

533
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,390
If Her Majesty finds out about this...

534
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,190
The Baili family...

535
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,910
It'd be the death penalty for your family line.

536
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,390
Our family will be ruined.

537
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,070
You, Liu Ran,

538
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,030
and hundreds of others in the Baili family

539
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,630
will be killed.

540
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,510
Hongyi,

541
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,750
I went to buy rice in the south market with Yunzhi.

542
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,350
We went to more than ten shops,

543
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,670
and all the rice was sold out.

544
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,470
There are many people fighting outside.

545
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,870
We've only got food that can last us three days,

546
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,630
and that's including fruits and veggies.

547
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,270
Liu Ran,

548
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,590
if I ask you to leave Luoyang with me now,

549
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:46,990
will you do it?

550
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,430
Of course.

551
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,510
Okay.

552
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,670
Then,

553
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,710
you should start packing.

554
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,750
Let's leave Luoyang in a few days.

555
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,070
Hongyi,

556
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,630
what's wrong?

557
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,230
I am fine.

558
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,790
Don't lie to me!

559
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,390
What happened?

560
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,950
I am now faced with a choice.

561
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,830
If I make the wrong one,

562
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,870
I could put you and all of the people

563
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,830
in the Baili family at risk.

564
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,990
However, I don't know how to make the choice.

565
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,590
The Baili Hongyi I know

566
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,390
has never been indecisive.

567
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:40,990
He only does

568
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,630
what he thinks is right.

569
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,510
That's why I married him.

570
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,510
Hongyi,

571
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,230
if you want to do something,

572
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,630
just do it.

573
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,510
No matter what happens,

574
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,630
I will always be there for you.

575
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,390
Sir.

576
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,390
The King of East River was attacked.

577
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,780
Your brother took over our Services shortly after.

578
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,670
It's natural that they'd feel angry.

579
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,110
What do you feel?

580
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,710
I know that

581
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,230
my brother was hard on you several times,

582
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,150
but he's now taking over

583
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,590
by order of Her Majesty

584
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,470
so that

585
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,470
we can destroy the Clan

586
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,750
and find the stolen grain.

587
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,230
So,

588
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,110
whether it's for the people in Luoyang,
 or for my own sake,

589
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,910
I hope that

590
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,910
you can help my brother.

591
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,870
After Hanjia Granary was blown up,

592
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,310
Four Season Clan has been active

593
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,230
by River Luo in northern Luoyang.

594
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,190
That's the poorest place in Luoyang,

595
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,150
where the Unwelcome Well is located.

596
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,710
The famine in Luoyang

597
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,699
took the heaviest toll on that area.

598
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,429
If I guessed right,

599
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,150
Four Season Clan

600
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,310
will use the grain of Hanjia Granary

601
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,909
as leverage

602
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,030
to buy people's loyalty.

603
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:26,989
Sir,

604
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,110
we've just got a message that

605
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,429
a large number of refugees and beggars

606
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,510
flooded in the south and north markets.

607
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,670
We suspect that people of Four Season Clan

608
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,350
are among them.

609
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,790
We found this

610
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,429
on a beggar.

611
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,670
We couldn't get anything out of him,

612
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,590
so we let him go.

613
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,469
A branch of the rose of Sharon?

614
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,190
Four Season Clan

615
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,510
has taken action.

616
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,670
The first thing I want you to do

617
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,750
is to contact all the refugees and beggars
 in Luoyang.

618
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,190
Ask them to help

619
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,550
spread a message.

620
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,430
If the civilians in Luoyang

621
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,750
hang a branch of the rose of Sharon on their doors,

622
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,510
then, someone will send grain

623
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,950
that can last them three days at night.

624
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,910
How is that possible?

625
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,990
There are so many people in Luoyang.

626
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,150
Much grain is needed

627
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,870
even for all of us to have one meal,

628
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,030
let alone three days!

629
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,910
Whoever sent this message

630
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,070
must be up to something.

631
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,270
Maybe they're ill-intentioned.

632
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,030
Great!

633
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,590
We're about to die!

634
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,870
Who cares if they're ill-intentioned?

635
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,190
Four Season Clan sent us grain.

636
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,070
There will only be less grain in the future.

637
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,630
It'll be too late to regret it!

638
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,510
Great!

639
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,270
Great!

640
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,150
Thank you, the almighty Clan!

641
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,630
Thank you, we've got food now!

642
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,020
Thank you, the almighty Clan!

643
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,470
It's just a branch!

644
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,310
It's as simple as that.

645
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,110
Let's have a try.

646
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,830
Great!

647
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,350
If we hang a branch, we'll get grain!

648
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,550
It's true!

649
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,190
Look!

650
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:48,790
Dear!

651
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,350
This is...

652
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,620
Grain!

653
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,550
Grain!

654
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,470
Thank you, the almighty Clan!

655
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,310
Grain!

656
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,990
What does the branch represent?

657
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,270
There's no grain left in Luoyang.

658
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,910
Where did they get the grain to cook?

659
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,390
Is it possible that Four Season Clan

660
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,550
has been sending them grain?

661
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,070
Luoyang is on lockdown.

662
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,990
It's heavily guarded day and night.

663
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,870
People of the Clan

664
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,470
won't take the risk of going on streets like that.

665
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,990
Yanqing said yesterday

666
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,150
that a large number of refugees and beggars

667
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,710
flooded in the south and north markets.

668
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,510
I think they were most likely

669
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,990
bought by Four Season Clan.

670
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,390
What good can they get

671
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,430
from this, though?

672
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,670
If these people

673
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,070
took grain from Four Season Clan,

674
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,950
would they be considered as disciples of the Clan?

675
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:08,910
Of course not.

676
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,070
They're poor people who are starving.

677
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,390
Maybe they don't even know

678
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,030
what Four Season Clan is.

679
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,190
If it is Four Season Clan

680
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,230
that's sending them grain,

681
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,030
it must be the stolen grain

682
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,990
from Hanjia Granary.

683
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,550
What would they do

684
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,700
if someone reported it to the authorities?

685
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:27,910
Madam Wu!

686
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:28,990
Madam Wu!

687
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:30,910
Madam Wu!

688
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,670
There have been 19 riots

689
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,740
in all the 17 markets,

690
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,790
including the south and north markets.

691
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,390
34 civilians got hurt.

692
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,390
Three died.

693
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,300
Have you found out the reason for the riots?

694
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,110
Yes.

695
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,870
Local authorities have received reports

696
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,670
that their people colluded with Four Season Clan.

697
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,030
The authorities went to confiscate the grain,

698
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,110
which led to conflicts.

699
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,020
Inform all the departments

700
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,350
not to act on their own.

701
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:53,990
If you hear anything,

702
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,990
let the Intelligence Services know immediately.

703
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,710
Yes.

704
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,190
Four Season Clan

705
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,110
has set the fire.

706
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,710
They only need to fan the flames a bit

707
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,630
so that the civilians

708
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,830
can be enraged.

709
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,030
Don't take it away!
