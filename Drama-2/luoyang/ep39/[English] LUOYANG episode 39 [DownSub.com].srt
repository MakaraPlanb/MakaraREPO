have left Luoyang.

6
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,770
Gao Bingzhu has been behaving as usual.

7
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,530
He's keeping guard over the rice shops
at the south market.

8
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,440
Keep an eye on them.

9
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,039
Yes.

10
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,759
Are the Thunders

11
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,680
in the right place?

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,450
My lord, you can rest assured

13
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,540
that nothing will go wrong.

14
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,690
Then get everything prepared.

15
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,300
When the time comes,

16
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,420
take action immediately.

17
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,200

Sir,

21
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,970
people are at the south market now.

22
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,690
We have checked their identity documents.

23
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,880
All entrances to the market

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
are now guarded.

25
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,190
We conducted another inspection

26
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,200
of the grain-sending place.

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,860
Her Majesty will go to the market
to open the granaries

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,700
and to relieve the poor.

29
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,680
It's a matter of great importance.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
We can't afford any mistakes.

31
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's go.

32
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,329

till today.

41
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
I'm aware that

42
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,670
many of you

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,640

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,290
You've suffered a lot.

46
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,010
Those evildoers were targeting me,

47
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,620
so you suffered because of me.

48
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,950

I hereby swear that

53
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,370
I will rebuild Hanjia Granary

54

I'm here today

Sir, where are you going?

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,310

65
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,450
saying that she wants to reward you

66
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,800
for stopping the famine.

No one would blame you.

80
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,170
I have to thank you as well.

83
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,770
Open the Granary.

We have food now!

94
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,320
Her Majesty opened the Granary!

95
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,340
Sir, are you expecting something?

96
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,420
Forget about it.

97
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,490
The bomb attack you meticulously planned

98
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,750
won't happen.

99
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,610
It's you.

100
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,680
It's you!

101
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,300
I have to say

102
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,660
that you really know how to hide yourself.

103
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,880
You organized all the conspiracies,

104
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,860
but you managed to stay out of them.

105
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,070
People who would possibly

106
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,210
tell others about your plans

107
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,260
were either killed

108
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,480
or bought by you.

109
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,320
I've always been suspecting that

110
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,630
Four Season Clan

111
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,140
must have an accomplice who's in hiding.

112
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,990
I didn't pay attention to you

113
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,540
until what happened at Hanjia Granary.

114
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,470
Four Season Clan

115
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,610
led us to Longguang Gate on purpose

116
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,630
so that they could hide their real intention.

117
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,730
Hanjia Granary

118
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,160
was the real target

119
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,250
of the Thunder.

120
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,110
Only at this point did we know

121
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,410
that Baili Kuanren

122
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,710
was the person behind the Clan.

123
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,560
Destroying all the grain in Luoyang

124
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,110
and causing riots

125
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,250
would do nothing good

126
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,510
to Baili Kuanren.

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
A rebellion led by starving people

128
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,330
was like throwing straws against the wind.

129
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,010
So, this couldn't be

130
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,100
his ultimate goal.

131
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,790
After the explosion of Hanjia Granary,

132
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,970
the Crown Prince lost power
and the Intelligence Services was handed to you.

133
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,900
Everything was out of control.

134
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,070
You were the only person

135
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,920
who benefited from this.

136
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,030
Lord Chu had been in charge of
our Services for years.

137
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,790
Four Season Clan would love nothing more

138
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,890
than seeing him leave the Intelligence Services.

139
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,740
Who will benefit from this

140
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,420
in the end?

141
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,920
Great analysis.

142
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,270
Even though you knew all of these,

143
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,330
you can't be sure that I did this.

144
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,480
No rush. I'll explain it to you.

145
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,450
After the King of East River was attacked,

146
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,170
you took over the Intelligence Services.

147
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,850
I started to suspect you

148
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,230
after that.

149
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,700
Once you came to our Services,

150
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,840
all the evidence

151
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,140
related to the King of East River's attack

152
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,940
and the explosion of Hanjia Granary was gone.

153
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,250
All the evidence

154
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,720
concerning the King of East River's attack was gone.

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,060
What about the explosion?

156
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,070
Also gone.

157
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,910
Apart from that,

158
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,290
you also gave yourself away.

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,270
When Hanjia Granary exploded,

160
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,230
you received the intel

161
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,870
before the Intelligence Services did.

162
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,980
You were hiding in the dark,
while we were an easy target.

163
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,660
You were always one step ahead of us.

164
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,640
I could only be sure about you

165
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,580
after Baili Kuanren was caught.

166
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,020
Siyue once mentioned that

167
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,320
a sentence Lord Freedom said.

168
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,980
When the Hidden Phoenix shows up,
the world will collapse.

169
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,380
The Hidden Phoenix I want

170
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,520
-is different from what they want.
-Hidden Phoenix?

171
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,280
They want me dead.

172
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,000
Lord Freedom was betrayed five years ago

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,430
and was arrested by the Imperial Court.

174
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,690
As for Lord of Spring and Lady of Autumn,

175
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,120
one died after becoming useless,

176
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,510
the other intentionally got himself killed.

177
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,990
So who on earth is Hidden Phoenix?

178
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,800
How could Four Season Clan

179
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,520
be destroyed that easily,

180
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,860
unless the destruction of the Clan

181
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,540
was also part of the plan?

182
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
I know how powerful the Thunder is.

183
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,390
The explosion of Hanjia Granary

184
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,270
couldn't be caused

185
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,660
by so many Thunders!

186
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,500
All the disciples were caught.

187
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,520
We also found the grain,

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
but we didn't find

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,920
the rest of the Thunders.

190
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,680
That's because

191
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,000
you took them.

192
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,600
Her Majesty planned to
open the Granary and relieve people.

193
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,270
Nothing

194
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,530
is more important than this.

195
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,210
However, you gave me

196
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,390
the most important job.

197
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,480
You asked me to guard the grain.

198
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,160
From that moment,

199
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,500
I realized that

200
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,270
you were planning to kill me.

201
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,770
You will take the most important task

202
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,610
to guard the grain.

203
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,950
Are you able to do this?

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm the Halberdier of the Intelligence Services.

205
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,100
I will do anything as told.

206
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,000
Weeds are all over the fields.
Set fire to them.

207
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,910
You want to be the emperor.

208
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,420
Killing Her Majesty

209
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,050
is not enough.

210
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,440
So you planned

211
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,490
your own show.

212
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,340
You destroyed Four Season Clan first,

213
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,800
an organization

214
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
you had supported all the years.

215
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,660
Then you attacked the King of East River

216
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,090
and framed the Crown Prince for hoarding grain.

217
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,310
You became Her Majesty's

218
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,320
most trusted man.

219
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,870
You put down the riot,

220
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,960
found the stolen grain,

221
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,970
and won people's support.

222
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,270
You're now in charge of

223
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,240
the two Services,

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,710
and the army.

225
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,670
You can finally step forward,

226
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,350
protect the city, save people,

227
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,910
and get everyone's admiration

228
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,000
with proper reasons.

229
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,640
You want everyone to believe

230
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,390
that Wu Youjue

231
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,120
is the only savior.

232
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,770
Am I right?

233
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,170
You've been under my watch

234
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,390
all the time.

235
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,740
How did you sabotage my plan?

236
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Lord Hongyi and Lady Liu Ran

237
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,020
will leave Luoyang tonight.

238
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,610
They've set up a banquet at Dangyang Tavern

239
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,830
and wanted to invite you over.

240
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,640
It was difficult to sabotage your plan

241
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,780
without raising your attention.

242
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,000
Luoyang just survived the famine.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
The Tavern is empty without much food available.

244
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
These dishes are barely good enough

245
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,950
to be rated 'Satisfactory.'

246
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,660
What's wrong with being empty?

247
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,600
I hate the hustle and bustle of Luoyang.

248
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,300
Gao Bingzhu always hopes that people in the Well

249
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,940
could live in Luoyang.

250
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,590
I'm wondering when the chaos in Luoyang

251
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,580
will come to an end.

252
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,260
He's saying opposite things intentionally.

253
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,530
He is suggesting that more disasters

254
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,410
will happen in Luoyang.

255
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,850
Just sing

256
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,660
the most famous song in Luoyang.

257
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,540
The name is...

258
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,110
Praise the Heavenly Monument.

259
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,110
The Heavenly Monument?

260
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,840
Her Majesty could be in danger.

261
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,320
The Heavenly Monument in the sun

262
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,380
is more graceful than the fairyland.

263
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,610
It's the most magnificent place in Luoyang

264
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,330
where you'll be mesmerized by peonies.

265
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,380
Exactly this line.

266
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,510
Peonies?

267
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,990
It seems that we need the Peony Token

268
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,750
to save Her Majesty.

269
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,220
Do you remember

270
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,430
where we met each other

271
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,490
for the first time?

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,310
Why did he mention

273
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,150
our meeting at the south market?

274
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,370
Something might happen at the south market.

275
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,270
You are the one

276
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,370
who worked out the Lianshan Rhyme

277
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,840
and found the Thunder.

278
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,350
You helped us a lot.

279
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,860
Lianshan Rhyme?

280
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
The Thunder?

281
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,850
Someone wanted to use

282
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,230
the Thunder at the south market.

283
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,590
The Lianshan Rhyme
can help locate it.

284
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
There's a saying
in the Interior Guard Services.

285
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,140
'Keep order for Her Majesty

286
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,650
and protect Luoyang.'

287
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,500
It sounds so easy,

288
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,640
but prohibitively hard to do so.

289
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,650
It seems that Madam Wu is in trouble.

290
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,050
I have to find her
in the Interior Guard Services.

291
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,860
...Or I could go to the Well
 and ask Mr. Unsightly for help.

292
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,110
My conversation with Baili Hongyi

293
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,500
was recorded

294
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,550
word by word

295
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,140
and presented to you, right?

296
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,330
Your plan

297
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,010
was flawless.

298
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,770
You took over the Intelligence Services.

299
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,200
You believed that you knew

300
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,710
everything that happened in Luoyang.

301
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,760
But there are places

302
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,150
that even the Services can't reach,

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
like the Unwelcome Well.

304
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,670
Sir Wu of the Interior Guard Services

305
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,060
is planning a rebellion?

306
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,190
He placed many Thunders

307
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,290
at the south market.

308
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,340
He will set them off tomorrow

309
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,810
when Her Majesty opens the Granary.

310
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,430
Gao Bingzhu asked me to meet you

311
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,880
to prevent this from happening.

312
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,310
Okay.

313
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,610
Follow me.

314
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,650
If we ordinary people from the Well

315
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,450
left without permission,

316
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,080
we would...

317
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,010
we would be killed.

318
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,440
It's a capital offense!

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,740
Bingzhu helped us a lot.

320
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
We can't just stand by.

321
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,630
Indeed.

322
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,680
Did you forget

323
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,860
what happened to Xiaowu?

324
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,160
She's right.

325
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,910
Five years ago,

326
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,850
Bingzhu took Xiaowu and his friends out of the Well.

327
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,370
His friends all died.

328
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,290
Even if we're lucky enough to get out,

329
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,050
are we able to make it back?

330
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,620
He's right.

331
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,800
I know it's a dangerous mission.

332
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,440
But in the toughest time

333
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,140
for Gao Bingzhu,

334
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,480
he was thinking about you.

335
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,910
You and the Unwelcome Well

336
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,550
are his last hope.

337
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,410
I'm begging you.

338
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,170
Please help him to protect Luoyang.

339
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,050
Why do you remain silent?

340
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,040
Don't you always brag about yourself,

341
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,410
[Unwelcome Well]

342
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,460
saying how brave you are?

343
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,930
Why do you remain silent

344
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,700
at this critical moment?

345
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,770
Have you lost the braveness and pride

346
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,450
of the Unwelcome Well?

347
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,330
Baili Hongyi,

348
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,190
people in the Well are just cowards.

349
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,830
I'm sorry for that.

350
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,330
I'm 61 years old now.

351
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,640
I've lived long enough.

352
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,400
If an old man like me

353
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,950
can help you

354
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,470
and Bingzhu,

355
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,770
I won't have anything to regret when I die.

356
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,030
Please wait for a second!

357
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,440
Gao Bingzhu

358
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,160
never thought of being a hero.

359
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,220
He did all he could to protect Luoyang

360
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,860
because he wanted the Well to be safe.

361
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,720
When the nest overturns,
no egg remains intact.

362
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,480
If Luoyang was in danger,

363
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,400
how could the Well be safe?

364
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,710
Have you forgotten the days

365
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,990
when you were out of food and medicine

366
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,030
after the Well was shut down?

367
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,190
Indeed.

368
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,200
Makes sense.

369
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,210
He's right.

370
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,060
If we go with him...

371
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,110
I'm begging you.

372
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,710
Please help us.

373
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,230
Gao Bingzhu has risked his life many times

374
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,570
just to protect Luoyang,

375
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,170
but we didn't see that.

376
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,470
People on the ground

377
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
never treat us

378
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,740
like humans.

379
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,000
Very true.

380
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,760
He's right.

381
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,530
That's why you have to let them know

382
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,130
that you are the one

383
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,230
who save the city.

384
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,430
You are

385
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,110
the heroes of Luoyang.

386
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,470
I enjoy being a hero more than anything!

387
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,950
I'll join you!

388
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,710
Me too!

389
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,680
Mr. Unsightly,

390
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,800
see?

391
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,040
I'm not a coward!

392
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,690
Okay.

393
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,200
Count me in.

394
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,010
I'll go as well.

395
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,690
Count me in!

396
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,280
Count me in!

397
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,750
Me too!

398
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,590
I've been expecting this for a long time!

399
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,310
Count us in!

400
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,860
I'll join you.

401
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,120
Me too!

402
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,840
Count me in!

403
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,100
Count me in!

404
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,680
How can they

405
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,610
look down upon us?

406
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,660
Count me in!

407
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,330
I'll join you!

408
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,610
People

409
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,080
who were despised by you

410
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,260
stopped your plan!

411
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,690
None of the Thunders you placed

412
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,240
would set off.

413
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,290
Sir,

414
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,140
you lost.

415
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,960
I lost?

416
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,470
Gao Bingzhu,

417
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,380
you're so naive.

418
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,070
My plan did fail.

419
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,830
So what?

420
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,050
Remember,

421
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,280
what you just said

422
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,710
was only your guess.

423
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,840
You don't have proof.

424
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,610
Who will believe you?

425
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,090
Who will believe a dishonest slave

426
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,600
from the Unwelcome Well,

427
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,120
a person who got his best friends killed?

428
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,060
Don't forget,

429
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,420
you were the one
who guarded the rice shops at the south market.

430
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,300
You let those Well Officers

431
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,520
place the Thunders

432
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,990
at the south market.

433
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,580
You're the one
who wants to kill Her Majesty.

434
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,110
I already set the fire.

435
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,870
No one can stop this,

436
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,350
not to mention that you're on your own!

437
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,980
What makes you think

438
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,070
that I'm on my own?

439
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,430
The ghosts of people

440
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,220
who died of your plan

441
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,570
are watching you here!

442
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,250
Their sacrifices will be meaningful

443
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,890
only when you're executed!

444
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,400
All your plans

445
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,620
are intrigues.

446
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,790
You stop at nothing

447
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,670
to get what you want.

448
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,980
You sacrificed your family and friends.

449
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,810
You disregard others' lives.

450
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,030
Long live Your Majesty!

451
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,630
May peace prevail in Luoyang!

452
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,430
Did you hear that?

453
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,430
Long live Your Majesty!

454
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,790
They're human beings!

455
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,260
They're flesh and blood!

456
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,060
Wu Youjue,

457
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,160
you no longer have humanity.

458
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,930
All you have are ambition and desire.

459
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,720
People's lives

460
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,570
mean nothing to you.

461
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,960
Weeds are all over the fields.

462
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,760
That's what you said.

463
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,020
People who got in your way were weeds.

464
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,610
You could simply kill them.

465
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,920
What about those innocent people?

466
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,010
Why should they

467
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,730
bear the consequences

468
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,740
of your conspiracies?

469
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,040
Why should they lose their lives

470
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,050
just to help you become the emperor?

471
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
You said we were like weeds.

472
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,280
That's not true.

473
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,290
Let me tell you,

474
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,460
we are human beings.

475
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,600
We want to live our lives

476
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,690
in this world.

477
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,500
You want to sacrifice the capital

478
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,590
for your own benefits,

479
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,470
but did you ask

480
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,810
the opinions of the people?

481
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,150
Hurry!

482
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,240
Hurry!

483
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,500
[Order]

484
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,520
This is the order from Her Majesty.

485
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,500
Wu Youjue conspired with
Four Season Clan against Her Majesty.

486
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,120
We will arrest you

487
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,650
by Her Majesty's order.

488
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,360
Siyue.

489
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,850
Wu Siyue!

490
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,160
All the evidence

491
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,930
concerning the explosion of Hanjia Granary

492
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,440
and the attack of the King of East River

493
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,160
disappeared from the Intelligence Services.

494
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,810
Only one person

495
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,860
could do this.

496
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,260
Sir Wu.

497
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,300
Sir Wu?

498
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,680
My brother?

499
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,100
I'm listening.

500
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,800
Think about the two informers' case,
the murder of Song Liang

501
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,360
and the arrest of Baili Kuanren.

502
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,240
The person who benefited the most

503
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,460
from all of these

504
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,050
was your brother.

505
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,880
Lord Chu resigned

506
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,180
according to our plan,

507
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,110
but he was attacked
once he left the Services.

508
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,540
The person who took over

509
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,010
was also your brother.

510
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,560
Him taking over

511
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,030
was Her Majesty's order.

512
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,670
My brother didn't ask for it.

513
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,690
But once he came here,

514
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,690
all the evidence

515
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,830
related to the explosion and the attack

516
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,710
was gone.

517
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,680
This can't be a coincidence.

518
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,360
This is just your guess.

519
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,070
You don't have any proof.

520
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,760
What about Li Beiqi?

521
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,930
You know him the best.

522
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,570
Why would he want to

523
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,960
work for Four Season Clan for no reason?

524
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,590
Baili Hongyi and I

525
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,560
are under watch now.

526
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,540
This is an important issue.

527
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,670
I know you don't want to believe it.

528
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,020
You will go to meet your brother

529
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,860
and question him.

530
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,910
But we have to

531
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,790
be fully prepared.

532
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,630
If your brother

533
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,130
does work for...

534
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,520
He won't work for Four Season Clan.

535
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,610
What if he is the one

536
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,280
who is behind the scenes?

537
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,210
What should we do?

538
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,700
If he is,

539
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,210
I'll do everything to stop him.

540
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,060
What are you going to do?

541
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,510
[Unwelcome Well]

542
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,870
Before going back to
the Interior Guard Services,

543
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,590
go find Liu Ran first.

544
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
Tell her that

545
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,990
if you don't go meet her

546
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,330
at midnight,

547
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,720
ask her and Baili Hongyi

548
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,520
to meet me.

549
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,900
Also,

550
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,710
I need

551
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,380
your Peony Token.

552
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,560
I'll make a fake one.

553
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,030
Give the authentic one to Liu Ran

554
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,500
in case anything happens.

555
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,970
Her Majesty

556
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,390
will open the Granary tomorrow.

557
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,740
No matter who is behind the scenes,

558
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,870
they will take action.

559
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,930
The Peony Token will be

560
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,780
your secret weapon.

561
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,850
Liu Ran,

562
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,410
I need to ask you a favor.

563
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,670
What favor?

564
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,450
[Order]

565
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,110
Siyue,

566
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,590
isn't this your Peony Token?

567
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,260
If I don't contact you

568
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,390
at midnight,

569
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,070
ask Hongyi to meet Gao Bingzhu.

570
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Then, take this
to the Interior Guard Services.

571
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,190
I wanted to invite Madam Wu,

572
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,530

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,280
Father will take Liu Feng to Mount Zhongnan

763
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,420
to pray for Siyue.

764
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,330
Her Majesty showed mercy

765
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,980
and spared him.

766
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,750
She also planned to reward Hongyi.

767
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,310
Only when life is in danger,

768
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,200
when we experience rise and fall,

769
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,510
and when we succeed or fail

770
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,190
do we realize that

771
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,530
everything is easier said than done.

772
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,990
Baili Hongyi is smart and brave

773
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,420
and helped save Luoyang.

774
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,770
He will be the new
Deputy Minister of Works

775
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,380
with the title of Lord Evergreen.

776
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,720
The order is written on the right,

777
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,750
and will be effective immediately.

778
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,550
Thank you,

779
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,950
Your Majesty.

780
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,780
It's amazing!

781
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,320
So beautiful!

782
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,620
Be careful.

783
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,510
This is impressive!

784
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,900
Look at that one!

785
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,420
Bravo!

786
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,710
Bravo!

787
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,500
-Amazing!
-Bravo!

788
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,450
Bravo!

789
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,820
Qingye looks different now.

790
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,050
They were kids

791
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,640
from ordinary families.

792
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,540
They were just tricked
to go on the wrong track.

793
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,100
At the same time, they are lucky.

794
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,160
Luoyang

795
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,290
is an inclusive place.

796
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:52,050
♫It's been a rainy night in Luoyang♫

797
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,510
It will offer them chances

798
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,520
to start a new life.

799
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,320
I heard that you resigned.

800
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:59,980
♫The thunder was cruelly deafening♫

801
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,470
I did.

802
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,070
I'm leaving Luoyang for real this time.

803
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,500
Liu Ran and I

804
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,250
will take a trip.

805
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,610
♫We talked all night, trying to find the truth♫

806
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,270
When will you set off?

807
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,780
Tomorrow morning.

808
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,620
♫Hidden among the high towers♫

809
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,520
Not bad.

810
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,280
♫I didn't mean to overstep my boundaries♫

811
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,140
If you feel bored here,

812
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,400
you can join us.

813
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:23,870
♫History has blunted my blade♫

814
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
I'm fine.

815
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,410
Have fun.

816
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,110
You're all alone here.

817
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:32,150
♫The scars have faded in time♫

818
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,710
Why do you want to stay?

819
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,040
Look at this.

820
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,580
♫The story of your life is written in your palm♫

821
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,030
♫Love, hatred, and everything♫

822
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,900
What do you see?

823
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,460
Peace.

824
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,200
♫How I wish fate will be in my favor♫

825
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,270
Prosperity.

826
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,830
But I see

827
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,010
wealthy people,

828
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:56,630
♫The blood has filled the city river.
We are connected by the gentle flow♫

829
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,350
ordinary people,

830
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,740
and people from the Well.

831
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,130
My sister Tan

832
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,230
might be around them.

833
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:04,650
♫The truth has been shredded into pieces
The same as us, broken pieces♫

834
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,710
I won't give up.

835
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,990
It's great to see

836
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,760
Luoyang like this.

837
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:13,410
♫The city wall has collapsed
Who will collect the pieces♫

838
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,710
Everything doesn't come easily.

839
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,990
The peace here

840
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,920
is what Siyue wanted to protect the most.

841
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:21,850
♫I wonder when I will free myself from it all♫

842
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,940
That's why I'm staying here.

843
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,750
I'll protect Luoyang for her.

844
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,190
I might come back

845
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,540
in the future.

846
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,510
I'll see how Luoyang may change

847
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,650
with your protection.

848
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,990
No problem.

849
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,440
Take care.

850
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,540
Okay!

851
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,300
Amazing!
