00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
grew by rivers,

10
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,660
and flourished to the River Gu.

11
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,259
What does that mean?

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,860
I think Four Season Clan is very likely

13
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,850
using miasma as a natural barrier.

14
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,380
So, for all these years,

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,810
no one has ever located them.

16
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,500
Where does miasma form?

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,210
It's recorded on my waterway map

18
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,460
that miasma tends to form
in the forest north of the River Gu.

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,940
Here.

20
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,980
That can't be right.

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,820
How can the Clan people get in if there's miasma?

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,810
[River Gu]

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,740
People are most likely to get lost

24
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,820
near the River Gu where there's miasma.

25
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,780
The great rose of Sharon lived on miasma.

26
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,490
There must be a rose of Sharon wood
 on the north bank

27
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,970
and it must be the Clan that planted them.

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,530
These trees can absorb miasma

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,170
and guide the way.

30
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,620
That must be it.

31
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,900
Finding that forest

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,890
means finding their location.

33
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,540
Sounds reasonable.

34
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,730
You're not going, are you?

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,580
What do you mean?

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,010
You're being so generous.

37
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,660
Run a small business with the money.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,050
Stop selling fake wines

and getting beaten up all the time.

40
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,060
You're not that young anymore.

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,620
It's time to think about getting married.

42
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,100
Find a girl

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,690
and live a good life together.

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,370
I believe in destiny.

45
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,860
How about introducing someone to me?

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,329
I'm off.

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,340
Let me know if you need such help again.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,450
What a lucky day!

49
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,660
Why did it sound like his last words?

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,770
Everyone that gets in or out

51
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,690
is being investigated.

52
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,890
Gates and roads are all blocked off.

[Mo Wubing, Xu Shiqin, Interior Guards]

55
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,010
Sir Li is so suspicious,

56
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,140
but she only asked us to bring him back

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
rather than arrest him.

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,700
She is so biased.

59
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,250
She even hides this from Sir Wu.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,540
It's not about being biased.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,420
It's a cover-up!

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,050
Exactly.

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,740
If you've got a problem, say it to my face.

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,820
Madam Wu.

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,460
You think I'm covering up for Li Beiqi?

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,810
Okay.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,620
Then tell me,

68
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,980
what crime did Li commit?

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,810
Is there a conviction?

70
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,900
Have you got evidence?

71
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,740
It's been just one day.

72
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,380
You've started to speak ill of him.

73
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,770
Li Beiqi is your comrade,

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,930
your buddy who goes through
fire and water with you.

75
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,420
You talk behind his back now.

76
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,940
Then, you'll do the same to others in the future.

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,460
If you're ever in danger,

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,980
do you still think others will help you?

79
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,970
Madam Wu, Sir Wu wants to see you.

80
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,050
Recite Interior Guards' Motto

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,500
The forest to the northwest
of the River Gu is vast

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,410
and rarely visited.

96
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,220
Finding the wood of rose of Sharon out of it

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,540
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

98
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,730
We've searched the forest.

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,210
This is the most suspicious place.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:43,980
Okay.

101
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,060
Now that the location is clear,

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,810
I'll set off.

103
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,980
The Intelligence Services only supervises.

104
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,330
This is all we can do.

105
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,210
We can't support you with more people.

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,659
I know.

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,370
Whatever happens,

108
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,610
stay safe first.

109
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,020
Retreat immediately if there's any danger.

110
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,660
I won't act recklessly.

111
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,500
If I find anything,

112
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,690
I'll try my best to send a message back.

113
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,060

114
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,020
get a carriage.

115
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,540
I'm going to the Palace to meet Her Majesty.

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,100
Why did you not tell me?

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,290
We agreed that during your recovery,

118
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll carry out your duty.

119
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
This is such a big matter.

120
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,380
Can't you tell how serious it is?

121
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,250
It is our own man who's done wrong.

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,200
-Li Beiqi has done no wrong!
-No one can live if Her Majesty knows!

123
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,780
He's done no wrong?

124
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,970
How can you make sure of that?

125
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,340
I have absolute trust in him.

126
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,659
There must be something we don't know.

127
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,100
We just need to ask him when he's back.

128
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,340
When he's back?

129
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,140
What if he doesn't come back?

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,940
What if he's never coming back?

131
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,460
Do you think that's something

132
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,570
an interior guard should say?

133
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,740
Wu Siyue,

134
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,730
you should be very clear

135
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,900
that Li Beiqi is whom I myself trained.

136
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
The last thing I want

137
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,200
is for him to get into trouble.

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,420
However, it's because of this

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,090
that we cannot cover things up for him.

140
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,300
I am not covering up for him.

141
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,370
Li Beiqi has just gone missing for one day.

142
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,100
How come he is a suspect now?

143
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,250
Because

144
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,540
he is the closest person to us!

145
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,810
I tell you,

146
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,409
I don't want us to be the last to know

147
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,260
if Li Beiqi really has done wrong.

148
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,060
Do you hear me?

149
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,650
I'll go find out the truth now.

150
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,380
The ring puzzle is so hard.

151
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,250
I tried my best,

152
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,890
but they're still just some iron rings.

153
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,700
I can't make a loop out of them.

154
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,450
If I have an extra finger

155
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,810
like you,

156
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,380
I can probably make it.

157
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,020
I've told you a million times.

158
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,860
Do not mention my fingers!

159
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,860
Lord Kuanren.

[Baili Kuanren, the eldest son in the Baili family]

162
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,060
Sit down.

163
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,980
Hongyi,

164
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,500
I just scolded you in the study.

165
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,650
It is my fault.

166
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,930
Don't hate me.

167
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,580
You can't work this out, right?

168
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,060
Let me teach you.

169
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,410
Look.

170
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,930
To figure out the ring puzzle

171
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,820
is not about how many fingers you have,

172
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,340
but about finding the trigger in it.

173
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,780
You did work out the second ring,

174
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,660
but you ignored

175
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,300
how the first and the third are related.

176
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,490
Now,

177
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,660
put on the first ring and try again.

178
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,500
I solved it!

179
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,410
Great!

180
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,090
Hongyi,

181
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,050
don't be obsessed with what you've achieved.

182
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,180
Sometimes,

183
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,300
letting things go

184
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,180
can get you some pleasant surprises.

185
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,700

186
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,130
after he pleaded guilty

187
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,610
and eventually died of illness at home.

188

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,060
and examined the body in the Baili Mansion.

190
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,930
The deceased has six fingers on the right hand.

191
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,460
It can be confirmed that he was Baili Kuanren.

192
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,860
You failed?

193
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,140
My lady,

194
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,580
we were about to succeed,

195
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,060
but...

196
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,020
but arrows came out of nowhere.

197
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,740
We had to leave.

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,890
It was you who sent people
to rescue Baili Hongyi, right?

199
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,860
You have no proof,

200
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,980
so you'd better not slander me.

201
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,220
Lord Six-Finger,

202
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,260
I didn't expect that

203
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,100
it's been years after you joined the Clan,

204
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,330
but you're still thinking about
your damn brother.

205
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,940
I tell you,

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,690
even though Baili Hongyi is your brother,

207
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
he has figured out the secret of the Thunder,

208
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,420
so he must die.

209
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,860
You don't want the great plan

210
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,380
that the Clan has been working on for so long

211
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,740
to fail, do you?

212
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,810
Still,

213
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,900
don't accuse me

214
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,340
until you get evidence.

215
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,290
Baili Kuanren,

216
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,610
do not forget

217
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,820
what you swore

218
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,900
to His Lordship.

219
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,700
I, Baili Kuanren,

220
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,290
shall join Four Season Clan now.

221
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,780
From now on,

222
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,410
I have no parents,

223
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
relatives or friends.

224
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,260
All people in the Clan

225
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,690
are my siblings.

226
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,780
Those outside our Clan

227
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,580
are all weeds!

228
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,250
The weeds are all over the fields.

229
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,500
[Lord Freedom, Leader of Four Season Clan]

230
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,570
Set fire to them.

231
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,210
The weeds are all over the fields.

232
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,610
Set fire to them!

233
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,250
My lady,

234
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,260
this suits you the best.

235
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,620
Look at the color.

236
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,460
Believe me. It will look nice.

237
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,410
Look at them.

238
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,340
Am I right?

239
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,210
Don't go.

240
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,220
Look at this.

241
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,020
Bingzhu!

242
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,860
What are the odds?

243
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,780
You're going out of the city, too?

244
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,580
I'm also...

245
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,810
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

246
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,980
Go back now.

247
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,570
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

248
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,900
You haven't got a child
to pass on your family name to.

249
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,570
The Gao family won't have future generations.

250
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,940
Let's go back, plan carefully,

251
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,050
and get some help before going.

252
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,820
Cut the crap.

253
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,220
This is my own business.

254
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,810
Go back now.

255
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,500
If you keep following me,

256
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,730
I'll break your legs.

257
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,570
Even so, I have to follow you.

258
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,090
Bingzhu, I'm serious.

259
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,700
Go back with me

260
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,740
or bring me with you.

261
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,580
In case anything happens,

262
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,100
I can send your message back.

263
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,850
Then listen,

264
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,730
if there's any danger,

265
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,370
protect yourself first.

266
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,370
If I ask you to leave, you must go.

267
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
Don't worry. I'll be the first to run.

268
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,250
If you die,

269
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,660
I can at least bring your body back.

270
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,180
Madam Wu,

271
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,300
the attendance registers

272
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,380
don't seem to have any problem.

273
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,580
Madam Wu,

274
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,970
I've asked everyone

275
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,820
and it can be confirmed

276
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,900
that Sir Li would leave the Services

277
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,980
for unknown places

278
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,740
every one or two days.

279
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,620
Li Beiqi normally reports

280
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,660
before he leaves.

281
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,540
But for the last few days,

282
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,220
there's no record of him on the registers.

283
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,050
How could that be?

284
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,780
Madam Wu,

285
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,260
Sir Li is also my good friend.

286
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,500
I don't want to doubt him,

287
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,450
but now that it's come to this...

288
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,420
I know what you're going to say,

289
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,940
but all I trust is evidence.

290
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,860
Let's go. Check his room.

291
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,300
Siyue,

292
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,690
if it weren't for you today,

293
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,220
that guy would've gotten out of the city.

294
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,580
How did you know he was fishy?

295
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,940
He did try so hard

296
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,060
and darkened himself with paint,

297
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,860
but unfortunately,

298
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,980
he forgot to paint the small part behind his ears.

299
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,220
Who else could it be?

300
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,180
You finally turned the tables around.

301
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,460
I bet no one

302
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,780
would dare to say you relied on Sir Wu

303
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,050
to join the Interior Guard Services.

304
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,020
Interior guards don't drink!

305
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,700
Shh!

306
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,900
This case

307
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
is worth an exception.

308
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,010
This is Feng's rice wine.

309
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,820
I saved six months' salary for this.

310
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,340
We must have a taste of it.

311
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,130
Come on.

312
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,090
Then I won't say no.

313
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
Madam Wu, something's wrong here.

314
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,640
[Kang Zhanbi, Kang Jin, Li Ji, Dai Zhou]

315
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,140
And this.

316
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,660
Wasp stinger?

317
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,930
The Thunder?

318
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,410
Yes.

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,820
It is a weapon that
Four Season Clan has been working hard on.

320
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,410
We can't estimate its power now.

321
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,970
The Clan has been working on such a weapon.

322
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,300
Why was the Intelligence Services

323
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,620
not aware of it at all?

324
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,700
Then, have you figured out

325
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,060
where Four Season Clan is going to use it?

326
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,460
I did not do my job well.

327
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,100
It was all my fault.

328
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,329
-No more confession.
-I...

329
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,940
You're here to see me.

330
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,099
I believe you have got an idea.

331
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,579
I'm afraid the Ceremony of Light

332
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,060
will be full of danger

333
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,540
because of the Thunder.

334
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,010
I beg Your Majesty

335
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,260
to postpone the Ceremony.

336
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,700
You mean that

337
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,060
Four Season Clan plans to ruin the Ceremony

338
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,340
with this weapon.

339
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,180
Are they going to create chaos

340
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,970
or...

341
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,380
They want to kill me.

342
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,740
A merchant from the outlands called Kang Zhanbi

343
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,600
[Kang Zhanbi, Kang Jin, Li Ji, Dai Zhou]

344
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,860
died of Shachi Venom.

345
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,100
He lived here when he was alive.

346
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,590
[Guanglin Inn]

347
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,090
He went missing

348
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,890
after Kang Zhanbi died.

349
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,370
They must be avoiding someone.

350
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,020
To escort Li Ji

351
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,220
was Sir Wu's last-minute decision.

352
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,300
How could one

353
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,210
know it so quickly?

354
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,810
Why are you behind me?

355
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,940
I was working on a case near Xing Jiao Fang.

356
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,660
I saw your horse

357
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,620
tethered at the end of the alley,

358
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,810
so I came to find you.

359
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,140
He died of wasp venom.

360
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,820
Wasp stinger.

361
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,340
Didn't I tell you to keep him safe?

362
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
I never left here.

363
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,500
You were still outside.

364
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,780
I was worried, so I waited by the door.

365
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,730
I didn't know he'd...

366
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
I don't dare to say so.

367
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,330
I am just worried.

368
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,260
But

369
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,140
I have sent the Halberdier of our Services

370
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,500
to find the hideout

371
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,100
of Four Season Clan on his own.

372
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,850
On his own?

373
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,620
Yes.

374
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,300
On his own.

375
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,850

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,620
Yes.

564
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,300
But off work,

565
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,580
we are not close.

566
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,490
Do you know Li Beiqi's whereabouts or not?

567
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,620
Madam Wu,

568
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,340
I've never colluded with Li Beiqi.

569
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,740
Why are you interrogating me like I'm a criminal?

570
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,370
Just answer the question truthfully.

571
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,770
I'll have my own judgment.

572
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,530
I really don't know where he is.

573
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,420
Three days before Li Beiqi went missing,

574
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,220
you drank with him in Shang Lin Fang.

575
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,540
What do you mean, madam?

576
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,940
Li Beiqi is not only my comrade

577
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,720
but also my superior.

578
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
It was not proper for me

579
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,900
to refuse his invitation for a drink.

580
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,340
Bingzhu,

581
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,020
we have been walking

582
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,700
around the roses of Sharon.

583
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,140
Why don't we go through the forest?

584
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,410
Have you ever heard

585
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,730
any sound made by birds or insects?

586
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,580
Oh, right.

587
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,780
Why is such a big forest so quiet?

588
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,140
There is no living thing in this forest

589
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,740
because it's full of miasma.

590
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,090
It's because the roses of Sharon absorbed miasma

591
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,570
that we don't smell anything.

592
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,980
If we weren't going around them,

593
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,340
we would've died from toxins.

594
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,890
Thank you, rose of Sharon.

595
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,330
Thank you, rose of Sharon.

596
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,490
So we...

597
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,060
Stop!

598
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,980
Stop there!

599
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,100
You said there's no living thing here.

600
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,060
Here! Right ahead!

601
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,170
Stop!

602
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,460
Stop!

603
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,060
Stop there!

604
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,650
Stop!

605
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,660
Stop!

606
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,770
Stop!

607
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,970
Catch her!

608
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,340
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

609
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,580
Stop!

610
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,580
Stop running! Catch her!

611
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,010
Stop there! Stop!

612
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,530
Stop!

613
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,370
Stop running!

614
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,660
Stop right there!

615
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,570
Stop!

616
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,890
Stop!

617
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,210
Stop there!

618
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,050
Stop!

619
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,020
Stop running!

620
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,260
I...

621
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,610
I really didn't know anything.

622
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,490
I got in by accident.

623
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,850
You wanted to run, huh?

624
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,780
Did you?

625
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,260
I really know nothing!

626
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,420
Why...

627
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,500
Why did they run away?

628
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,370
Whoever has had relations with Li Beiqi

629
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,580
will be interrogated.

630
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,890
That's tricky.

631
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,500
Whoever offended him

632
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,700
can get into trouble.

633
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,170
Li Beiqi is missing

634
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:20,820
and he's suspected

635
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,100
to have colluded with Four Season Clan.

636
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,930
The Ceremony of Light is approaching.

637
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Perhaps

638
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,540
Madam Wu has her reasons.

639
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,420
It makes no sense.

640
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,180
We have to bring it up to Sir Wu.

641
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,620
Sir Wu is probably the one

642
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,420
who feels the worst because of Li Beiqi.

643
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,420
I'm worried this can affect his health.

644
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,260
Let's not bother him with this.

645
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,010
But Li Beiqi

646
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,330
has nothing to do with us.

647
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,890
The one who trusted him the most

648
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,900
is Madam Wu herself.

649
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,820
But now she interrogates us as if we're criminals.

650
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,970
That will only disappoint us!

651
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,700
True.

652
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,340
Madam Wu.

653
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,650
This is what you just said.

654
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,140
I checked your schedules.

655
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,740
It seems that

656
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,300
someone wasn't telling the truth.

657
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,660
I do believe

658
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,740
you didn't mean to deceive me.

659
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,530
Madam Wu,

660
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,290
this is Sir Wu's order.

661
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,900
When you finish,

662
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,170
ask them to go to the Baili Mansion.

663
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,770
Okay. You can go now.

664
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,620
Yes, Madam.

665
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,340
Sui Xin,

666
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,100
stay here.

667
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,930
Here.

668
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Slow down.

669
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,820
Are you okay?

670
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,770
Don't touch me.

671
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,040
We saved you.

672
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,730
You didn't even thank us.

673
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,620
Who knows if you're on their side?

674
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,180
Would we save you if that's the case?

675
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,930
Take a look.

676
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
Do you want to add anything?

677
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,210
Madam Wu,

678
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,820
I have answered all your questions.

679
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,020
If you don't trust me,

680
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,010
you can simply arrest me.

681
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,700
Three days ago,

682
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,130
it was your time off.

683
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,600
Yes.

684
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,740
That night, the Grand Court

685
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
sent someone to do a handover.

686
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,860
It should've been Li Beiqi who handled it,

687
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,050
but your stamp

688
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,290
was on the handover register.

689
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,460
The same night,

690
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,780
Li Beiqi let a group of refugees

691
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,650
get into Luoyang.

692
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,620
His stamp

693
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,850
was on the license.

694
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,740
What happened?

695
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,290
I did cover his shift for once,

696
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,460
but

697
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
when he asked me

698
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,500
to cover his shift,

699
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,420
he said Sir Wu asked him
to go out of the city for work.

700
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,170
Sir Wu.

701
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,220
Sir Wu.

702
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,980
She looks suspicious.

703
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,540
Don't touch me!

704
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,690
It should be fine now.

705
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,530
Who were those two guys?

706
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,370
Why were they after you?

707
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,460
I don't know.

708
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,260
Probably they're from the academy.

709
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,740
The academy?

710
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,130
I was picking herbs

711
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,060
and got into an academy by accident.

712
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,930
I looked around

713
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,130
and found nothing special,

714
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,610
but after I got out, they tried to kill me.

715
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,020
Where is the academy?

716
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,340
That way.

717
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,060
Walk around for a while,

718
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,610
turn right, and you'll see a cliff.

719
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,580
Then go down.

720
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,020
It's far away, anyway.

721
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,860
Could you take us there?

722
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,100
I don't want to get myself killed.

723
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,260
The two assassins

724
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,940
must be waiting for you somewhere.

725
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,570
I don't think you should walk around.

726
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,610
Sui Xin mentioned me.

727
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,500
You must have a lot of questions for me.

728
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,540
Go ahead.

729
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,290
Don't think of me as Sir Wu

730
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,660
or even your brother.

731
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,820
Just see me as a stranger.

732
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,770
Do it the way you normally do.

733
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,219
Sir Wu,

734
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,460
Sui Xin said

735
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,889
it was you who sent Li Beiqi
outside the city for work.

736
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,820
Is that true?

737
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,690
No.

738
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,460
But this doesn't make for proof.

739
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,820
I'm only a witness.

740
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,460
Besides, every interior guard knows

741
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,610
Li Beiqi is close to me.

742
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,780
No one can order him

743
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,210
other than me.

744
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,420
Do you believe me?

745
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,300
Let's say Li Beiqi lied.

746
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,020
He used you as an excuse

747
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,250
and let a group of refugees enter Luoyang

748
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
before he went missing.

749
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,610
Then we found a name list

750
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,740
in his room.

751
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,580
All the names

752
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,580
are targets of Four Season Clan.

753
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,900
All of this suggests that Li Beiqi

754
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,130
has something to do with the Clan.

755
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,140
The next one who will die...

756
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,310
[Kang Zhanbi, Kang Jin, Li Ji, Dai Zhou]

757
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,370
Dai Zhou.

758
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,460
Dai Zhou is alive!

759
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,880
We can interrogate Dai Zhou!

760
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,900
Perhaps he can prove Li Beiqi is not involved!

761
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,940
That is what I came for.

762
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,300
I received news from the Eastern Palace.

763
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,130
Dai Zhou died in a well

764
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,220
the next day after he was sent back to the Palace.

765
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,940
If Dai Zhou's death

766
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,170
was related to Li Beiqi,

767
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,740
he must have had something

768
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,260
to do with Four Season Clan.

769
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,610
No way.

770
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,170
The Li Beiqi I know

771
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,180
is not like that.

772
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,850
Impossible.

773
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,740
I must have missed some clues.

774
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,380
Li Beiqi and I

775
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,130
grew up together.

776
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,860
-He is not like that.
-Siyue...

777
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,850
Siyue!

778
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,460
I must have neglected some clues.

779
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,530
Siyue, stop it.

780
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,890
He won't betray us!

781
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,980
Even if he did,

782
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,860
I will arrest him by myself.

783
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,530
Wu Siyue.

784
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,570
Wu Siyue!

785
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,690
Brother.

786
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,500
Brother.

787
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,500
Where do you want to look for him now?

788
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,700
What matters now is not Li Beiqi,

789
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,620
but the Ceremony of Light.
