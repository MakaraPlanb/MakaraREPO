16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,100
Guang Yao, you agreed to live in our home.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
That's so good.

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
I couldn't be happier.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
Thank you, madam. It's my pleasure.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
Guang Yao.

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,800
If you find anything
to be unsatisfactory here, please tell me.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Guang Yao, help yourself.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
We are family.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
We've known each other well.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
That's right.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,400
Thank you, Uncle, Madam, and Miss Wan Ting.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
It's okay.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Thank you so much.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Well done.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Miss Mu.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's you!

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Are you… Miss Tan Si?

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Coincidentally,
I'm revising the album in the next store.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
Do you like painting, Miss Si?

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
I like painting portraits.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,200
But just as a hobby.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss Mu, are you familiar with Mr. Pei Shao Jun?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
No, I'm not.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,400
What about his friends?

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
No.

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,100
So how do you know Mr. Xu?

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss Mu.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Tell me how to get close to

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
a junior in
the warlord's mansion like him?

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,100
Why don't you ask me for help then?

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm experienced, you know?

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Why are you here?

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
Did you follow me?

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,100
You…

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
What do you mean?

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Look at you.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,500
You look so fierce. Like a demon.

54
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
When girls see you, they have to run…

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
run the other way.

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
I am very popular.

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,600
Tan Si told me you secretly escaped again.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Do you want me to lock you up?

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
How dare you!

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
I didn't break the law.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Listen.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
You may be the Commander of Shanghai,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
but don't think of bullying
the weak and helpless.

64
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Do you think if you lock me up,

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
I…

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
I will release a report tomorrow?

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
I will break up with you.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
I will break your leg!

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,300
- Stop!
-Miss Mu, help!

70
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
Miss Si is still a child.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,200
Why do you treat her like this?

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
You don't know.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,700
She lacks discipline.

74
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,000
I was busy leading troops

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
so I couldn't take care of her.

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
So there are people beyond the control
of Commander Tan in this world?

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Boss, did you pack my painting?

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes, of course.

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,500
I'll get it for you.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Right. Here you are.

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,900
Thank you!

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm so hungry.

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,500
Brother Guang Yao.

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
I just moved here today.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I've come to say hello to you.

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Madam said you left for business

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
without having a bite to eat.

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,800
I've brought a late snack for you.

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Have a glass of milk first.

91
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
Thank you.

92
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
I was too busy to welcome you today.

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
It doesn't matter.

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
How is it going?

96
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
My mother's funeral will be in a few days.

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
I went to the funeral shop today
and got everything ready.

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Take care of yourself.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,200
If you need help, feel free to tell me.

100
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
By the way, Brother Guang Yao.

101
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,500
From now on, don't come to my room alone at night.

102
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Why?

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Wan Ting doesn't like it
when we are alone.

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,000
We'd better avoid suspicion.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
We grew up together.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,100
Is it necessary to avoid suspicion?

107
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
But last time after you came back
from the Command,

108
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,600
Wan Ting found issues with it.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,500
We'd better avoid it.

110
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,800
I have nothing to do with her.

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
What issues would there be?

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,000
But Wan Ting thinks she is your fiancée.

113
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,300
That's her own thinking.

114
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
Brother Guang Yao.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
In this family,

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Ms. Cui is the landlady.

117
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
Wan Ting is the eldest daughter.

118
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
I don't want to cause any trouble.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
All right.

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Please go back now.

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
Quick.

122
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
Oh… don't forget to have food.

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay, I will.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Good night.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
- What about this?
- Try it.

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,500
- The coffee is good.
- It's good.

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Wan Qing.

128
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,100
This is the new order from
the foreign trading company.

129
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,200
- Brother Guang Yao.
- Have a look.

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
What do you like?

131
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,800
Brother Guang Yao.

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
Doesn't this look nice?

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,000
Come and have a look.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
There are many new goods
that arrived today.

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Look for what you want.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,900
Thank you, Ms. Cui.

137
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
- Madam.
- Yes?

138
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,100
Baoli Pawn Shop called

139
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,200
saying they mistook the note of Miss Wan Qing.

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Please keep it properly,

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
and they will come to change it
tomorrow morning.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Why?

143
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,300
Let me have a look.

144
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,900
It's all right.

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,700
It's really the wrong note.

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Wan Qing.

147
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Did you have the jewelry repaired?

148
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
Brother's peace buckle was broken,

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
and I went to have it repaired.

150
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Payer, Tan Xuan Lin.

151
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Wait, isn't that the name
of Commander Tan?

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
Wan Qing, did you ask…

153
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,796
Commander Tan to pay for it?

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Mother, let me have a look.

155
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
- Why are you so troublesome?
- Let me have a look.

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,200
It's the signature of Commander Tan.

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
Father, look.

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,200
I'd say Sister and Commander Tan

159
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
must have a good relationship.

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
Otherwise, she could have asked us

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
to keep Yuan Hang's legacy.

162
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
Wan Ting!

163
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Wan Qing.

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Can you explain this?

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,400
- Hello?
 - <i>Commander Tan.</i>

166
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>If you have time,</i>

167
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,100
<i>please come to our house
for lunch at noon.</i>

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,200
That sounds good.

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
It'll be my honor.

170
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
I will go.

171
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
All right.

172
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:36,903
Tan Si,

173
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:37,753
get the car ready.

174
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,677
Mr. Mu invited us to lunch.

175
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:41,556
Why…

176
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,679
does Mr. Mu always surprise us like this?

177
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:45,493
The pork was stewed in soy sauce
for two hours.

178
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:47,493
Don't complain.

179
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
This is a coincidence.

180
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:50,626
The lunch today

181
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,400
will be very pleasant.

182
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,510
Let's go.

183
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,390
This way, please.

184
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:06,863
My lord.

185
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:07,830
The guest has arrived.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,876
Commander Tan.

187
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,910
Welcome.

188
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:11,784
Commander Tan.

189
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:12,939
Welcome.

190
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:14,976
Mr. Mu, thank you for your hospitality.

191
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,463
I came in a hurry,

192
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:17,632
so I did not bring a gift

193
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,053
other than a bottle of Jiangcheng wine.

194
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,466
Today, let's

195
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,960
drink with Guang Yao.

196
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:22,812
Good.

197
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:23,908
Come. Please take a seat.

198
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:24,532
Please.

199
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:25,598
Come.

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,510
Today, I invite Commander Tan to our house

201
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:33,676
first

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,230
to convey our welcome.

203
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,486
Second

204
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,230
is to thank you for looking
after our daughter.

205
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,830
Yes, Commander Tan.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,280
Wan Qing's peace buckle was broken,

207
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,794
and you paid to get it repaired.

208
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,150
We are very sorry.

209
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,840
As her mother…

210
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,320
I've been careless.

211
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:57,706
Ms. Mu.

212
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,632
It wasn't a problem.

213
00:11:58,716 --> 00:11:59,676
Please do not worry.

214
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,163
In fact…

215
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,553
Regarding our relationship.

216
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,590
<i>Even if I wasn't the one who broke it,</i>

217
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
<i>I would never ask you to pay.</i>

218
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,400
I broke the peace buckle,

219
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,760
so I had it repaired.

220
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,000
This is only natural.

221
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,146
Miss Mu didn't blame me for it.

222
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,200
I felt sorry for that.

223
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,551
So please don't thank me
for looking after her.

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,550
So you could break

225
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,443
such a small peace buckle.

226
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,376
What a coincidence!

227
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,590
It was indeed a coincidence.

228
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,840
I was with Shuang at Qi Bao

229
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
when I came across Miss Mu.

230
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,943
<i>Where did you meet?</i>

231
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,650
<i>I met him at Qi Bao.</i>

232
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,496
<i>He pulled me to him as soon as he saw me.</i>

233
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,700
<i>That's how it got broken.</i>

234
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:43,783
Wan Qing.

235
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:47,032
I think you didn't mind your steps
on the street,

236
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,316
and you knocked into Commander Tan.
Is that right?

237
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,910
That's not true.

238
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,790
I pulled Miss Mu to me,

239
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,590
perhaps a bit too aggressively,

240
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,230
and broke the peace buckle as a result.

241
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,826
<i>This peace buckle was broken
because of Commander Tan,</i>

242
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,400
<i>so he paid for its repairs.</i>

243
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,110
I don't mean to be rude, Commander Tan.

244
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:13,623
So

245
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,390
you walked on the street with Shuang.

246
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,026
Anyway,

247
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,551
Wan Qing is a lady from a noble family.

248
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,499
It's not good.

249
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,350
Well…

250
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,257
Oh, by the way…

251
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,440
What happened on that day?

252
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,337
<i>He was afraid that Brother Guang Yao
would know that he was on the street.</i>

253
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,423
Well…

254
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,230
<i>He talked about business with me,</i>

255
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:48,234
<i>but I didn't want to talk with him.</i>

256
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,350
<i>Please don't tell him you met me here.</i>

257
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,323
In fact…

258
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,330
In fact, I didn't want Miss Mu

259
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:01,435
to tell Guang Yao

260
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,119
that she had met me at Qi Bao.

261
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,983
Guang Yao,

262
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,430
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,963
I lied to you.

264
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
That time, I didn't drink with Fei An Dun.

265
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,529
I had to go shopping with Shuang.

266
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,562
So…

267
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,909
Commander Tan.

268
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,553
You went through so much trouble

269
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
just to avoid me.

270
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,803
Guang Yao,
I will punish myself with a glass of wine.

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,550
What a story! Really.

272
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,400
Yes.

273
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,532
In any case,

274
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,426
we should thank Commander Tan

275
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,146
for looking after our daughter.

276
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,552
Come!

277
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,196
Let's drink as much as we'd like today.

278
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,207
With pleasure, Mr. Mu.

279
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,545
Cheers!

280
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,572
Cheers!

281
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,599
<i>[BAOLI PAWN SHOP,
TWO HUNDRED SILVER DOLLARS]</i>

282
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,213
<i>[TAN XUAN LIN]</i>
<i>A pawn shop note</i>

283
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,230
<i>with a stamp from the Command.</i>

284
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,150
<i>Were you afraid nobody would know</i>

285
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,080
<i>you'd pay for it?</i>

286
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,019
<i>It's no wonder you
dealt with it perfectly.</i>

287
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,110
<i>It was your plan all along.</i>

288
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:18,296
<i>I will confront you about the note</i>

289
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,200
<i>and hear your explanation.</i>

290
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,588
<i>Mother.</i>

291
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,640
<i>Tan Xuan Lin covered for her today.</i>

292
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:37,703
<i>I was the one who broke the peace buckle.</i>

293
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,760
We went through trouble today

294
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,090
so Mu Wan Qing had no time

295
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,584
to discuss with Tan Xuan Lin.

296
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,029
Tan Xuan Lin's words
were the same as hers.

297
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,556
<i>Because their answers were the same,</i>

298
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,764
<i>this whole matter seems suspicious.</i>

299
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:50,523
They must

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,080
have some secrets.

301
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,110
That brat is so mean.

302
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,813
Luckily, you secretly

303
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,713
transferred her mother's dowry

304
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,067
and hid it from her.

305
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,253
<i>Otherwise she would have used the money
to bribe Tan Xuan Lin</i>

306
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,910
<i>and deal with us.</i>

307
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,583
<i>What should we do then?</i>

308
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,506
If we had known this,

309
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,960
we wouldn't have given her the jewelries.

310
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,164
The most expensive ones

311
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,222
were put in my mother's house.

312
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,760
<i>Now Brother Guang Yao
is living in our house,</i>

313
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,840
but this bitch is trying to lure him
to her in any way she can.

314
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,052
She's also fawning over Tan Xuan Lin.

315
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,506
<i>What should we do now?</i>

316
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:27,586
<i>She has two purposes.</i>

317
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,243
The first is money.

318
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,539
The second is a career.

319
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,010
Then

320
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,099
should we let her be?

321
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,846
This time, she succeeded.

322
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,109
To prevent your father
from questioning further,

323
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,822
we should wait.

324
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,358
Mother.

325
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,253
We have to remove her.

326
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,350
<i>We will get another chance.</i>

327
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,041
<i>Next time,</i>

328
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,230
<i>she won't be so lucky.</i>

329
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,576
Hello?

330
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>Thank you for today.</i>

331
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>Shall we meet somewhere?</i>

332
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,953
Miss Mu, this place is so nice.

333
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,776
I would have never expected

334
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,950
a noisy metropolis like Shanghai

335
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,640
to have such a quiet place.

336
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,710
Commander Tan,
you are used to noisy places.

337
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:48,236
Thank you for your time.

338
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,180
It doesn't matter.

339
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
As long as you like,

340
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,006
I'm willing to come.

341
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,050
Thank you for explaining everything today.

342
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,560
And so perfectly at that.

343
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,382
I just lifted my finger.

344
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:02,656
Lifted your finger?

345
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought you prepared for it.

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,110
You don't mean

347
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,590
to thank me for it, right?

348
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,956
It was just a note,

349
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,950
but you signed as the Commander

350
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:20,653
with the stamp of the Command.

351
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,993
I was extremely flattered.

352
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,722
Did you do this

353
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,603
for your act today?

354
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:32,283
Even if it was an act,

355
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,703
I'd say I was a good actor.

356
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,583
Yes, you were.

357
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:37,863
You made Cui Lian Feng and Mu Wan Ting

358
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,126
terrified of me.

359
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,706
They'll try again.

360
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,820
You can't get rid of them.

361
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,783
If Cui Lian Feng didn't

362
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,953
try to attack you,

363
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,310
how could she have got this note?

364
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,110
Do you think

365
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,640
you would survive in the Mu Family

366
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:59,935
if you just try to just avoid
the troubles?

367
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,903
You are right.

368
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,880
I won't be passive.

369
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,463
You mean

370
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,707
you agree to cooperate with me?

371
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:18,530
Yes.

372
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,350
I remember you

373
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:32,973
looked down upon my means of infighting.

374
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,033
A good horse never turns around
to graze on an old pasture.

375
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,633
I should think it over.

376
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,179
Commander Tan.

377
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:47,136
Is it wise to let me go
after controlling me before?

378
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,116
Haven't you worked so hard

379
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,337
to get me to cooperate with you?

380
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,266
You are a lonely commander

381
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,800
who needs the support of the Mu Family.

382
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,796
So at the party,

383
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,152
when you knew
I was Mu Zhi Yuan's daughter,

384
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,596
you made this plan.

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm listening.

386
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,243
You took my diary

387
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,073
without taking away the case,

388
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,430
because you wanted me to visit you.

389
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,696
And you extorted
fifty-thousand silver dollars from me

390
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:14,673
when you knew I could't afford it.

391
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,063
You saw me pawning jewelry
at the pawn shop

392
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,160
and appeared to rescue me
from embarrassment.

393
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,046
But you also prepared a note

394
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,769
to make Cui Lian Feng doubt
about our relationship

395
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:27,253
and to have my own father question me.

396
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,537
Everything you did

397
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:32,150
was to make me lose my stand
in the Mu Family

398
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,496
and to force me to work with you.

399
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:37,436
Commander Tan.

400
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,830
You did so well.

401
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,052
Congratulations. You win.

402
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,563
I did force you,

403
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,132
but you don't suffer losses

404
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,283
if you work with me.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,464
Anyway, only I know

406
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:54,173
how to turn over a poor fish.

407
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:00,850
If we cooperate,

408
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:02,179
I have two conditions.

409
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,243
Tell me.

410
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,553
First.

411
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,776
As partners,

412
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,206
we should trust each other.

413
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:11,593
From now on,

414
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,847
don't play tricks on me.

415
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:16,309
Second.

416
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,476
Partners

417
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,028
should benefit each other.

418
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:20,506
If you treat me well,

419
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,710
I will return the favor.

420
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,790
But don't try to ask for more.

421
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,756
Fine.

422
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:27,963
I agree.

423
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,890
I have a plan.

424
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:33,287
I will help you remain
in good terms with the Mu Family.

425
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,233
After you have a right of discourse,

426
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,833
help me raise my soldiers' pay.

427
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:38,066
What do you think?

428
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,586
How will you make that happen?

429
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,769
I have already sent a support for you

430
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:48,999
to the Mu Family.

431
00:21:49,597 --> 00:21:50,847
Do you mean Brother Guang Yao?

432
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:55,013
So it was your plan after all.

433
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,653
I never do anything without preparation.

434
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:05,173
If you stop playing tricks on me,

435
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:07,423
you are indeed a good partner.

436
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,000
I also believe you are

437
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,724
a reliable partner.

438
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,710
So, I'll return this

439
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:24,434
to you.

440
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,577
Do you have a lighter?

441
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:40,443
Yes, I do.

442
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,389
What do you want to do?

443
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,950
It's such a good diary!

444
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,110
Wouldn't it be a pity just to burn it?

445
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:55,369
No.

446
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:57,216

Listen.

450
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,640
If we work together as a couple,

451
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,710
we can achieve anything.

452
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,123
I will get back everything you've lost.

453
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:34,459
Then I have another condition.

454
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:36,254
Say it.

455
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,570
Don't say
that we're pretending to be a couple.

456
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,876
It hurts!

457
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:51,813

but I didn't get any news.

You didn't answer.

466
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:01,738
So

467
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,880
I had to come here.

to be friends with you.

I'm picky.

00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,677
And I don't like to make friends
without a reason.

480
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,586
It's coincidence that

481
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,560
I'm perfect.

482
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,350
I'm your choice.

You can't get rid of them

you don't have anything to do

00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,243

<i>They are in such a hurry.</i>

750
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:33,869
<i>Relax.</i>

751
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,040
<i>I will send people to
watch out for the hooligan</i>

752
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,760
<i>and protect you from harm.</i>

753
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,470
<i>Thank you.</i>

754
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,870
<i>Forget it. It's nothing.</i>

755
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:44,923
<i>I do it for myself.</i>

756
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:46,959
<i>If something was to happen to you,</i>

757
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:48,833
<i>wages for my soldiers would be gone.</i>

758
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,110
<i>I'm not cold.</i>

759
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:14,402
<i>Just put it on.</i>

760
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,870
<i>Don't worry.</i>

761
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:19,086
<i>I will try my best</i>

762
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,760
<i>to protect you.</i>

763
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,860
<i>[GOOD NIGHT]</i>

764
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,549
Good night.

765
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,960
<i>♫ Tears turn into heavy rain ♫</i>

766
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,800

the starting point of our meeting ♫</i>

767
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,020

774
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,160
<i>♫ The memories
that bring me back to life from afar ♫</i>

775
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,560
<i>♫ Let's embrace
either during sunrise or sunset ♫</i>

776
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,320
<i>♫ In this world of chaos and confusion ♫</i>

777
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,080
<i>♫ I have exhausted my desolate life ♫</i>

778
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,840
