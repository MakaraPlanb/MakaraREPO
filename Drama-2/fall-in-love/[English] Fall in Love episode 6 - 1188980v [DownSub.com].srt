Madam,

00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,120
this is the Five Phases Amulet

00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,720
May you

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,199
keep it carefully

19
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,599
and be safe and happy.

20
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,919
Thank you, Master.

21
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,520
<i>I'm not cold.</i>

22
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:20,830
<i>Don't worry.</i>

<i>I'll do my best</i>

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Since you try to protect me,

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,919
I will return the favor.

27
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,839
Cui Jie?

28
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,939
This is my nephew.

29
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,826
What did you do?

30
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,203
Uncle.

31
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,119
This man.

32
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:46,575
When Miss Mu was

33
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,739
at her mother's wake yesterday,

34
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:49,507
he broke into Fayuan Temple

35
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,516
and tried to do something indecent.

36
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,496
You!

37
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,673
He said he worked for Ms. Mu.

38
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,136
And Ms. Mu

39
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,426
ordered him to do that.

40
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:00,745
Me?

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,410
It pertains to Ms. Mu's reputation,

42
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,827
so I brought him here on purpose

43
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,698
and handed him over
to you for questioning.

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,080
What's wrong with you?

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,080
When did I let you go to Fayuan Temple?

46
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,720
How can you do such a heartless

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
and evil thing?

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,639
You got no conscience!

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,730
You!

50
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:20,465
Bastard!

51
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,653
Even a dog won't bite its owner.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,156
Guang Yao.

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,919
I'll leave him to you.

54
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,679
Beat or punish him as you wish.

55
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,326
This has nothing to do with the Mu Family.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Uncle! Uncle!

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,160
How can you think that I would do that?

58
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,039
I would never do such thing!

59
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,236
I… I wouldn't do that!

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,361
It's as if a toad tried
to swallow a swan!

61
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,040
But

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,919
Cousin Wan Ting said…

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,559
She said…

64
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:49,960
What did she say?

65
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:53,733
She said that my aunt

66
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,559
intended to marry Miss Mu with me.

67
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,356
And so

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,119
she asked me to go to Fayuan Temple
to meet Miss Mu.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,143
She said if I was fond of her,

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
I can molest her.

71
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,690
What?

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,430
What I said is true!

73
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,520
Help me! Help!

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,647
Aunt, help me.

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,559
Cousin Wang Ting really said this to me.

76
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,450
No way.

77
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,246
Is he telling the truth?

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,650
My lord,

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,679
do you think I could possibly say that?

80
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:23,048
Go and bring Wan Ting here.

81
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,016
Hurry!

82
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,063
Wan Ting.

83
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:47,345
This bastard snuck into Fayuan Temple

84
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,266
and tried to rape Wan Qing yesterday.

85
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:51,826
He said you told him to go there.

86
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:52,688
Is this true?

87
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:53,892
I didn't.

88
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,240
Cousin,

89
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,349
how could you say that?

90
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,593
I didn't do anything wrong to you!

91
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,889
How could you say that?

92
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,138
You did tell me that!

93
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,275
You said…

94
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,121
You said that Aunt

95
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,645
intended to have Miss Mu marry me.

96
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:06,155
You told me to go to Fayuan Temple
to meet her.

97
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,397
That if I like her,

98
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,320
I can rape her.

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,595
Father.

101
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,239
I'm an unmarried girl.

102
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,000
How can I let you do such a thing?

103
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,480
You did say that!

104
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,045
You specifically went to
Jinlou to look for me.

105
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:22,959
<i>Young Master Cui.</i>

106
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,736
<i>[CHECK: TWO THOUSAND SILVER DOLLARS]

107
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,803
<i>Let go of him.</i>

108
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,063
<i>It's the young lady from the Mu Family.</i>

109
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,106
<i>My cousin!</i>

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,873
<i>Let's go.</i>

111
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,839
Those servants were all witnesses!

112
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,959
If you didn't tell me,

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,396
how was I supposed
to know about Ms. Xiao's funeral

114
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,783
and how Miss Mu was at the vigil?

115
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,556
I did

116
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,359
run into you at Jinlou yesterday.

117
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,315
And I happened to see you
being chased around due to debt.

118
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,920
So I helped you pay it back.

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,412
Cousin.

120
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,205
How can you say that about me?

121
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,595
You told me

122
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,720
Miss Mu from Japan grabbed your spotlight

123
00:05:57,914 --> 00:05:58,715
so you asked me to help you

124
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,581
take revenge.

125
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,746
Did you not tell me that?

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,054
I didn't.

127
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,048
You're lying.

128
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,229
You.

129
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:05,245
My lord.

130
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,419
It's all my fault.

131
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,000
I spoiled you

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
too much,

133
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,160
so you are now behaving irrationally

134
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,359
and saying things.

135
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,332
But she may have

136
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
just used words without thinking.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,395
She can't do such

138
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,079
harmful things.

139
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:24,669
You said

140
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,273
Miss Wan Ting ordered you.

141
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,370
Do you have any proof?

142
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,490
Proof?

143
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,426
Yes, I do.

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,970
That check.

145
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,506
That's the evidence!

146
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,559
Check?

147
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,606
Yes.

148
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,919
Wan Ting.

149
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:46,052
Is there such a thing?

150
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:47,817
I…

151
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:50,983
I…

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,040
You asked me

153
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,760
for a check yesterday.

154
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,880
You said that one of your classmate's
family members was in trouble,

155
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,285
and you had to help him pay off the debt.

156
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,035
Did you lie to me?

157
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,640
Tell the truth!

158
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:13,636
Father.

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
I did

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
bump into him yesterday.

161
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,836
But I did it

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,200
because you were part of my family.

163
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,566
I didn't want to see
your fingers get chopped off

164
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,710
and disgrace our family.

165
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:25,315
That's why I helped you
and didn't tell Moth--

166
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,155
You!

167
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,600
Mu Wan Ting, you have to tell the truth,

168
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,130
or you will get me killed!

169
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,966
Do you understand?

170
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,371
Please tell the truth.

171
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,396
You said it was a reward!

172
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,519
A reward!

173
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,679
- I'm not lying.
- Reward!

174
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,875
If you don't believe me,

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,810
call the men at Jinlou here,

176
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,357
and they'll confirm it!

177
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:58,316
Wan Qing.

178
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
It's your father's fault.

179
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,480
I didn't think it through.

180
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
I should have let someone be with you.

181
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,743
Of course,

182
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,640
Wan Ting also has her issues.

183
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,480
If she hadn't said something wrong,

184
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,480
it wouldn't let the shameless guy get

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,359
the chance to do it.

186
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,949
For the sake of

187
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,239
Wan Ting's

188
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:20,715
unintentional mistake

189
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,920
that she also admitted to,

190
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,995
please forgive her.

191
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:25,302
Please?

Sister.

193
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,524
I didn't mean to hurt you.

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,799
I was also used by others.

195
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,559
Please forgive me.

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,637
Please?

197

It's up to you, Father.

198
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,119
You shall be grounded for a month

199
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,930
and won't be allowed going anywhere.

200
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,403
Mother.

201
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:10,212
Thank you.

202
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:13,346
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

203
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,513
Whatever you do,

204
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,510
you should consider

205
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,883
the immediate consequences.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,653
Do you know how dangerous things are
these days?

207
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,517
I know. I was wrong.

208
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
Whatever you do in the future,

209
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,278
don't do things by yourself.

210
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,838
Come discuss it with me first.

211
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,046
But this time,

212
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
that bitch got off easy.

213
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,082
Don't worry.

214
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,528
We have plenty of time,

215
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,039
and we will get our chance.

216
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,211
I can't believe

217
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:53,813
Uncle Mu would accept

218
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,306
those explanations so easily.

219
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:57,358
Because in his mind,

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,347
he couldn't believe

221
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,700
Wan Ting would do all of that.

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,271
It would've been futile

223
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,297
to keep trying.

224
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:07,491
I really hate that.

225
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,034
How can he not think about you?

226
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,640
You don't have to fight for me.

227
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,840
When my brother died,

228
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,290
Father immediately brought

229
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,254
Aunt Cui and Wan Ting home.

230
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,320
This is nothing.

231
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,236
I understand.

232
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,922
I'm worried about

233
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,982
you staying by yourself
in a family like this.

234
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,640
I'll figure something out.

235
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:36,862

237
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,882
I told you to give me some time.

Please stop pestering me.

239
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,830
If you need more time,

240
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:48,150
I'll give it to you.

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,960
As long as you're not afraid of
running out of money,

242
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,595
I can have a longer discussion

243
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,600
with you.

Have a seat.

247
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,443
I came to see you

248
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
not because of the program,

249
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:06,172
but for another matter.

250
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,840
I'd like you to give me a favor.

251
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,596
Are you asking me to help you?

252
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,287
Fine.

253
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,746
I'll do whatever if I can.

254
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,239
It's not a big deal.

255
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
I want Wan Qing

00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:22,499
to be my foreign language secretary.

257
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,059
Wan Qing has agreed.

258
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,039
Are there any problems with that?

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,119

00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,960

00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:36,563
Wouldn't that be better?

Wan Qing is good
at both Japanese and English.

00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,102
Fine.

00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,506
Let Miss Mu come to work tomorrow.

271

If she can't work alone,

272
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:53,943
I'll find her a helper.

00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,380

274
00:11:58,305 --> 00:11:59,463

00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,559
to have Wan Qing go.

304
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,413

Wan Qing is in mourning for her mother.

And regarding the kidnapping…

307
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,320
He feels sorry for Wan Qing.

308
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,464
So he thinks it's better to let Wan Ting

309
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:41,988
be your foreign secretary.

310
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:43,806

00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,357
Someone who speaks English, Japanese,
and Chinese.

00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:15,953
is not a good choice.

00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,039
Brother Guang Yao.

00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,743
When I was in school,

327
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,024
I wasn't good at studying.

But now I've

329
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,666
tried to catch up.

00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,440
You don't even let me try.

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,970
Miss Wan Ting.

333
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,050
This is a job,

334
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,235
not a children's game.

335
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,880
Guang Yao, you probably do not know.

336
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,830
Once Wan Ting works hard,

337
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,679
she would do well.

338
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,187
You

339
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,547

Brother Guang Yao.

341
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,080
Since Wan Ting wants to try,

342
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,039
let her do it.

343
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm also tired today

344
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,799

00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes, Wang Qing.

You look so exhausted
after the past two days.

347
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,320
Since you came back from Japan

348
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,623
and have been busy
with your mother's funeral,

349
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,050
you haven't been able to take a rest.

350
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,280
I happened to stew
a good blood swallow soup.

351
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,595
I'll send it to you

353
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,159
It'll be good for your health.

You're welcome.

My men are such fools.

753
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,439
They didn't know you.

754
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,439
I'm sorry you were wronged.

755
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:49,760
Yeah, exactly.

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,800
The two men are so stupid.

757
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
They shut me in there
without saying a word.

758
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,879
Commander Tan.

759
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,590
You should teach your men well.

760
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
Of course, I'll teach them.

761
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,239
Listen.

762
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,356
Do you hear that?

763
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,879
They are being punished.

764
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,143
Okay.

765
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,800
But how come you are here?

766
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,320
Where is Brother Guang Yao?

767
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,959
You mean Supervisor Xu?

768
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:14,840
He seems to have gone to the film premiere

769
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,199
with Miss Wan Qing.

770
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,320
Now,

771
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,760
the movie should be over.

772
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,876
What? Watch a movie?

773
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,116
Didn't you know?

774
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,360
Miss Wan Qing is a fan of Gu Yue Shuang,

775
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,399
so Guang Yao Bro

776
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,239
asked me for two VIP tickets.

777
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,739
I guess it's the love seat.

778
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,490
Miss Wan Ting.

779
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,719
Please go back, Mr. Wei.

780
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:53,826
Don't tell anyone about

781
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,679
what happened today.

782
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:13,719
You may stop.

783
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,520
It might still be needed tonight.

784
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:15,227
Yes.

785
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:21,959
You.

786
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,639
Military secrets should be
kept confidential.

787
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,159
How can you

788
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,239
not understand?

789
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,840
Mother.

790
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,479
I worked hard

791
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,320
all day there.

792
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,320
I didn't even have lunch.

793
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,639
But that bitch

794
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,879
asked Brother Guang Yao

795
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,080
to go to the movie premiere.

796
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,840
I worked all day long,

797
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,560
but she took advantage of it.

798
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
It really hit me.

799
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
Are you still blaming others?

800
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:49,965
You do things without thinking carefully.

801
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,823
Please.

802
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
What are you doing?

803
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:08,750
You.

804
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,080
Are you going to fight with Mu Wan Qing?

805
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,872
You.

806
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,280
You screwed things up.

807
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,199
Do you want Xu Guang Yao
to see your mistake?

808
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
Mother, I worked all day

809
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,760
and went to jail.

810
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,439
Yet, they could stay together?

811
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:23,983
I quit.

812
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,239
Screw being his secretary.

813
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,199
Screw his Command.

814
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,679
I'll never go there any more.

815
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,919
It's better if you don't go there.

816
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,280
On your first day at work,

817
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,000
you make a mistake
by leaking military secrets.

818
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,159
If time goes on,

819
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,120
I don't know what mistakes you will make.

820
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,719
If Warlord Xu finds out,

821
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,280
how can you have a good image?

822
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,639
Well. If that bitch goes there,

823
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,320
wouldn't it be cheap for her?

824
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,959
She'll spend every day
with Brother Guang Yao.

825
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,919
The Command is a military agency.

826
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,159
She goes to work as a secretary.

827
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,280
She has to work.

828
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,439
You think she's dating?

829
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,600
Forget it, I won't go.

830
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:10,919
Well. You.

831
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,600
You're foolish.

832
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,679
It's 50,000 silver dollars

833
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:18,199
in exchange for one day of work
at the Command.

834
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,439
It's all for nothing!

835
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,360
Please. Miss Secretary.

836
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,000
Yes, sir.

837
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,900
<i>[THE DEFENSE COMMAND OF SHANGHAI]</i>

838
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,580
<i>[AROUSE ALL EFFORTS
TO MAKE THE COUNTRY PROSPEROUS]</i>

839
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,280
Miss Wan Qing.

840
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,040
Welcome.

841
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,360
I would appreciate your guidance later.

842
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:28,639
You give me a great honor.

843
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,760
You're the secretary Supervisor asked for.

844
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,120
Of course I'll take care of you.

845
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:33,800
I have also prepared

846
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,760
a special office for you.

847
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,159
Even Miss Wan Ting didn't
get such treatment.

848
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,199
Let's go. Let me show you.
