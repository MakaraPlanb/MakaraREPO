All done.

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,839
How do you know how to make up?

23
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,039
If you have two women in the family

24
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,880
who won't leave home without makeup,

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
you'll pick it up no matter
how stupid you are.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,600
Stop staring at me like that.

27
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,119
You make me feel like a pervert.

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,279
I used to fix Jiang Zitong's hair
when she was a kid.

29
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,600
It's truly blessed to be your sister.

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
My sister is not
the most blessed person.

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,160
My wife...

32
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,839
It's late.

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's go.

34
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,880
Here.

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,600
Smile.

36
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,080
Done.

37
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,919
You're here.

38
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,199
Do I sign here?

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,160
I want to take this opportunity
to show Lu Li around.

40
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,520
The summit has not started yet.

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,800
Let me introduce the investors to you.

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,600
Sure.

43
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,559
Take care.

44
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,600
Don't sprain your ankle.

45
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,839
I'm fine.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,279
Don't worry about me.

47
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm not worried.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't want you

49
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,880
to embarrass me.

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,759
Yicheng, this way.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,839
Hi.

52
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:10,759
Mr. Jiang.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,880
(The 1st Game Developers Summit)
Mr. Jiang.

54
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,759
Mr. Li is over there.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,040
I have a new idea.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,119
It's an interactive game.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,119
We'll connect the mobile phone
and the computer.

58
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,239
When we're out, we can play it
on our mobile phones.

59
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,079
When we are home,
we can play it on the computers.

60
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,880
What do you think?

61
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,959
That's not a bad idea.

62
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,920
Do you want anything?

63
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,160
I'll take it for you.

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,839
It's okay.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,160
You seem like a quiet person.

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm not a quiet person.

67
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,079
I simply don't feel like talking
at the moment.

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,720
You're really an interesting person.

69
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,160
By the way,

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,720
are you Mr. Jiang's secretary?

71
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,799
I'm a programmer.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,119
Are you kidding me?

73
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't believe you

74
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,799
unless you can prove it.

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,440
How can I prove it?

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,239
What about this?

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,160
Tell me

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,160
how to socialize with programmers.

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,679
You should never call them
the computer repair technicians.

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,679
No.

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,119
You should never point out
their mistakes.

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
Eat something.

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,480
Lu Li. Go get the bill.

84
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,399
Take care.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
Mr. Jiang.

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,399
You're making me look bad.

87
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,519
I said I would get the bill.

88
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,760
Mr. Li.

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,079
This is my home ground.

90
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,640
Of course, I should be hosting you.

91
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,760
Fret not.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,119
When I visit Shenzhen in the future,

93
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,279
you'll have to buy me a meal.

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
By the way,

95
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,200
he is my right-hand man,

96
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,320
Liu.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
He's an all-rounder,

98
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,600
but unfortunately, he's still single.

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,279
Mr. Jiang.

100
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,880
Do introduce him to some nice girls
if you know any.

101
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,320
Mr. Li.

102
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,119
I don't think I can be of any help.

103
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,200
That girl looks pretty decent.

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
It seems like they had a good chat

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,279
and they both enjoyed it.

106
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,880
I find Miss Lu quite interesting too.

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
Besides, she's a programmer.

108
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,239
That's right.

109
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,359
You shall propose a toast

110
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,399
to thank Mr. Jiang
for introducing a nice girl to you.

111
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,440
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

112
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I should've introduced her earlier.

114
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,160
Miss Lu

115
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,799
is my wife.

116
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,320
It was a misunderstanding.

117
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,320
Just a misunderstanding.

118
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,239
Cheers.

119
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:56,959
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,239
I should've made it clear earlier.

121
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:58,959
Here.

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
Yicheng said I looked good in blue.

123
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,799
I didn't expect you
to be in the same color as well.

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,559
He picked this color.

125
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,359
Seemingly, he still likes
the same thing as before.

126
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,760
We are different.

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I used to be just like you,

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,399
but I'm different now.

129
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,839
I can help him in building rapport,

130
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,880
and am capable of doing
many things I couldn't do before.

131
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,119
Career and love are separate.

132
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,000
I guess he has already
made his stance clear

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,799
when he decided to bring me here today.

134
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,920
I've been through this,

135
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,440
and I want to give you
a piece of advice.

136
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,679
Don't judge a book by its cover.

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,559
What do you mean?

138
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,440
Yicheng is working so hard
to win all the investors over,

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,279
because he wants to

140
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,160
free himself from his parents.

141
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,160
He doesn't want to be threatened

142
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,920
to make another choice

143
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,760
that he will regret later.

144
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,519
I suppose you don't need me
to elaborate on this further.

145
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,200
This...

146
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,159
What's going on?

147
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,799
Yicheng.

148
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,599
Yicheng.

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,039
Are you all right?

150
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,400
Li Man.

151
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
Don't touch me.

152
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,159
I want to go home.

153
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,640
You...

154
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,799
Don't touch me.

155
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,200
Be careful.

156
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,159
I want to go home.

157
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,559
Be careful.

158
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
Let me help you.

159
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,239
Let me do it.

160
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,599
I want to go home.

161
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:34,280
Is Miss Li coming home with us?

162
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,960
You should go home early too.

163
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,760
Let's go home.

164
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,320
Be careful.

165
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,719
Goal!

166
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,039
Be careful.

167
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Be careful.

168
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,440
The bed's right here.

169
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,599

170
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,520
I am Lu Li.

171
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to go home.

172
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,239
You're already home.

173
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,840
This is your home.

174
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,640
I want to go home.

175
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,679
This is your home.

177
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,640
Let me help you to bed.

Morning.

214
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,119
Have you just got up?

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,080
Were you the one
who brought me home yesterday?

216
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Who else

217
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,880
could it be?

218
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,239
I remember that Li Man
insisted on bringing me home.

219
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Then...

220
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,359
Then, I blacked out.

221
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,200
Then, did we...

222
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,479
You know it well.

223
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,520
I'm uncontrollable when I'm drunk.

224
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,799
After I helped you to bed,

225
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,320
I went back to my own room.

226
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,840
I have no idea

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,119
what happened in your room later.

228
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,880
Then...

229
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,559
Who changed my bedsheet?

230
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,960
You were drunk

231
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,280
and threw up on the bed.

232
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,159
If I didn't change the sheet,

233
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,559
you would surely give me a mouthful.

234
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,159
Is that all?

235
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,520
That's all.

236
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,280
Thanks for taking care of me last night.

237
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,079
You're welcome.

238
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,760
Don't drink so much again.

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,439
You are really heavy.

240
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,239
Was it all just a dream?

241
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,959
Xiaoqi.

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,319
Time for breakfast.

243
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll skip it. I want to keep sleeping.

244
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,719
Go back to sleep after you eat.

245
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,160
Otherwise, it'll hurt your stomach.

246
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,040
The dishes are getting cold.

247
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,560
Godmother said

248
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,880
that if you don't wake up right away,

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,719
she will remove your blanket.

250
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,359
How did you get in?

251
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,599
Your godmother asked me
to send you some fruit.

252
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,160
Don't you think

253
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,199
I will forgive you just because
you brought up my godmother.

254
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,680
We are no longer friends.

255
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,760
Gu Xiaoqi.

256
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,800
I don't want

257
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
to hear you saying this
for the third time.

258
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,359
Sure.

259
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,199
We're no longer friends.

260
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,479
This is my room.

261
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,479
Get out.

262
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,800
This photo was taken on
an outing we went on

263
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,800
when you were in middle school.

264
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,920
I bought that music box for you

265
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,760
with my first ever pay.

266
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,640
I gave that picture to you

267
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,640
as a coming-of-age gift.

268
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,479
This.

269
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,079
When you first entered high school,

270
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,439
you had to live on campus.

271
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,959
You were scared and you couldn't sleep.

272
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,680
I deliberately skipped class
just to buy this rabbit for you.

273
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,560
What are you doing?

274
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,599
Are you here to reminisce?

275
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Xiaoqi.

276
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,800
What I'm saying is

277
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,439
I took part in every stage of your life.

278
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,199
We are the closest to each other.

279
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,400
Therefore, there's no need for you

280
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
to throw tantrums at me
because of some unimportant persons.

281
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,040
Someone I had a crush on was
not an unimportant person.

282
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,880
Just because we grew up together,

283
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,239
it doesn't give you the right
to interfere in my relationship.

284
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,119
No.

285
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
I was just trying to
pick the right guy for you.

286
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,319
What am I to you?

287
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,560
Your rag doll?

288
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,520
Do you actually know what you did wrong?

289
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,079
Even my parents

290
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,680
don't control me like this.

291
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,359
Mom.

292
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,800
Mom.

293
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,839
Don't allow any outsider
into my room anymore.

294
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,040
What's wrong with you?

295
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,760
Mo is not an outsider.

296
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,959
She is so grumpy.

297
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,920
I hope she didn't scare you.

298
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,920
Of course, not.

299
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,839
I have seen every face of hers.

300
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,079
You're right.

301
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,160
Let me peel an egg for her.

302
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,920
Let me do it.

303
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,000
Look at the both of you.

304
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:50,880
You grew up together.

305
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,199
Why is she nothing like you?

306
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,319
I wish she could be
half as mature as you.

307
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,800
So annoying.

308
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,319
Why do you look blank?

309
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,599
How do you like it?

310
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,479
I can taste the sweetness
after the bitterness.

311
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,079
That's why they say

312
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,760
life is just like a cup of tea.

313
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,800
It's been a long time
since I last met you.

314
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,959
You haven't explained to me

315
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,719
what happened the last time?

316
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,560
Didn't you text me

317
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,439
all of a sudden

318
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,319
to tell me to leave the office?

319
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,079
Too many things have happened of late.

320
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,119
It felt like it was a long time ago.

321
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,040
Lu,

322
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
are you all right?

323
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,800
Perhaps I've been too occupied with work.

324
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,839
Speaking of work,

325
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,119
the senior you met

326
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,280
at the tea house last time

327
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,079
is Jiang Yicheng.

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,239
He is the founder of Enchant Technology.

329
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,880
He gave me a call just to ask about you.

330
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,680
Do you know each other?

331
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm working at Enchant now.

332
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,839
In fact, I sent you a text

333
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
because of him as well.

334
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,719
Look at you.

335
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,800
You even disguised as a man.

336
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,040
They say you're stubborn.

337
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,280
I think you're more than just stubborn.

338
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:03,520
You're foolish.

339
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,160
Are you calling me a fool?

340
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,760
These days, the world is
full of intelligent people.

341
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,719
In order to achieve a goal,

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,479
what we lack is
usually not intelligence,

343
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,680
but this foolishness.

344
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,479
That's nice.

345
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,280
Initially,

346
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,520
I wanted to recommend you
to work for their company.

347
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
Anyway, it has now ended up
the way I wanted it to.

348
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:27,680
Professor,

349
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,520
do you know Li Man?

350
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,319
Of course.

351
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,719
She was one of my students.

352
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,319
There aren't many girls in
the faculty of computer science.

353
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,599
Not only is she a pretty girl,

354
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,719
but she's also a smart one.

355
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,839
She left a very strong impression on me.

356
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,920
Why did you bring her up
all of a sudden?

357
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,680
I heard gossip in the office.

358
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,319
It's said that
she used to date Mr. Jiang.

359
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,640
Yes.

360
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,040
During their college days,

361
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,959
they were a famous couple on campus.

362
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
I thought

363
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,400
they would end up together.

364
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,599
What a pity.

365
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,719
Li Man left the country later.

366
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,719
Yes.

367
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,880
That incident has
hit Yicheng particularly hard.

368
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,839
Because of Li Man,

369
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,680
he ran into a car accident.

370
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,839
I worried

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,359
that he wouldn't recover from it.

372
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,760
Fortunately, he got over it.

373
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,359
It seems like he genuinely liked her.

374
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
By the way,

375
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,520
you somewhat share a resemblance
with Li Man.

376
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,719
How so?

377
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
Look.

378
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,359
Both of you are different from Yicheng,

379
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,359
the genius.

380
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,880
Both of you work very hard.

381
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
Once you set your goal,

382
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,040
you will keep moving forward
and never give up.

383
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,680
Besides,

384
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,520
both your names have "Li".

385
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,160
What a coincidence, right?

386
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,079
Yes. It really is.

387
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,719
Why are you on leave again?

388
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,239
What's wrong?

389
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,800
Leader Zhang, our companies
are working together

390
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,599
to develop "Xuan Zhong Ji".

391
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,319
I hope we can be more considerate
of each other.

392
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,520
Without this server,

393
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,119
our team will not be able

394
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,239
to work normally.

395
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,280
Miss Li.

396
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,119
Our company specially assigned
this server

397
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,239
to our team.

398
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,239
If you need anything,

399
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,760
you can request it from the company.

400
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,040
First come first serve.

401
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,599
Precisely.

402
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,199
Your team's name

403
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,640
is not written on the server.

404
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,560
Exactly.

405
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,239
If it's on
a first come first serve basis,

406
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,199
I received the parcel.

407
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,439
I unboxed it.

408
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,680
Look at the paper cuts on my hands.

409
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,000
You snatched it from us.

410
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:12,959
Snatched?

411
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,920
This has always belonged to us.

412
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,520
To be honest, we applied
for a server a long time ago.

413
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,520
It's true that it will
take some time to arrive.

414
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,359
The server belongs to the company.

415
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,599
It should be provided
to those who need it more.

416
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,680
Miss Li.

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,959
It's not that we don't want to
give up the server,

418
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
but our team needs it too.

419
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,479
Miss Li. Stop arguing with them.

420
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,079
Let's talk to Mr. Jiang directly.

421
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,479
The only thing these people know

422
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,359
is to sneak on others.

423
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,560
Who's sneaking on whom?

424
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,160
Who are you talking about?

425
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,079
Who are you talking about?

426
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,040
What's with the fuss?

427
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,239
I'm talking about you.

428
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,880
What's wrong?

429
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,640
What are you doing?

430
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,079
You only know how to sneak on others.

431
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,319
Hit me, then.

432
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,800
Stop yelling.

433
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,520
He's the one who's being unreasonable.

434
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,719
Miss Li, aren't you going to stop them?

435
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,199
Stop.

436
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,359
Stop.

437
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,719
Sit down.

438
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,000
This is not going to solve anything.

439
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Since neither of the parties
wants to give in,

440
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,560
we should compete for it.

441
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,719
Do you want to fight?

442
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,119
Sure. Let's fight.

443
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,359
Yes.

444
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:21,800
We are programmers

445
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
and we don't solve issues with violence.

446
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,119
We are going to fight with keyboards.

447
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,520
Whatever it is,

448
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,400
our team will certainly beat you.

449
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,520
Keep boasting.

450
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,040
We'll find out.

451
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,680
Miss Li.

452
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,599
What do you think about my suggestion?

453
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
How are we going to do this?

454
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,520
We'll use the airplanes.

455
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,719
Her words are truly horrifying.

456
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,920
How are we going to do this?

457
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,680
Are you saying we should have a match

458
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,119
to find out who writes the best program
to control the airplanes?

459
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,400
AI is the soul of a game.

460
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,800
However smart humans are,

461
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,439
we are no match for Alpha Go.

462
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,719
Perhaps we should write an AI program.

463
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,280
What are the details?

464
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,199
Firstly, there will be

465
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,199
100 auto-generated enemy aircraft
in the game.

466
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,239
They will be circling the area

467
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,520
on random routes.

468
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,000
Both of the teams

469
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,560
will appoint someone to write
an AI program

470
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,719
for aircraft of the same model.

471
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,239
Within a certain time frame,

472
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,719
we need to prevent our aircraft
from being crashed,

473
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,319
and in the meantime, bring down as many
enemy aircraft as possible.

474
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,119
Those are the rules.

475
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,680
Miss Li, what do you think?

476
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,520
Do you agree with this idea?

477
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,640
We accept it.

478
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,319
Okay.

479
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:36,680
Well.

480
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
We will send...

481
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,439
This guy.

482
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,400
Miss Li.

483
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,000
I heard that you were also a top student

484
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,959
who graduated from the Computer Science
Faculty of the University of Xinhai.

485
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
Let's have a one-on-one.

486
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,239
It's been a long time
since I last did coding.

487
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,839
I'm no longer familiar
with the keyboard.

488
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,040
If Miss Li refuses to accept
the one-on-one,

489
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,199
you should just surrender.

490
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,719
Although I'm no longer familiar with it,

491
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,680
I still have the foundation.

492
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,439
It will only take me a while

493
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,199
to get used to it.

494
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,280
After all, it's an invitation
from my junior.

495
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,839
I dare not reject it.

496
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,599
Let's do this.

497
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,040
Since both of you have agreed to this,

498
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
let me read out the rules.

499
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
You will be allowed two hours
to complete the coding.

500
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
When you're done with the coding,

501
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:39,920
the aircraft of both parties
will be launched at the same time.

502
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,680
It will last for five minutes.

503
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,839
Whoever shoots down
the most number of aircraft

504
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,959
will be the winner.

505
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,719
Start.

506
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,319
Miss Li does have a decent typing speed.

507
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,119
She said that she hadn't
been doing this frequently.

508
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,839
Being humble doesn't make one weak.

509
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,439
This is her strategy.

510
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,880
Shutian, who do you think
will be the winner?

511
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,680
When you're writing an AI program,

512
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,479
the most important thing
is decision-making.

513
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,000
It's just like a chess game.

514
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,880
Every environmental factor
in the present

515
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,119
will affect their next decisions.

516
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,000
The primary decision in this AI program

517
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,920
is about how to bring down
as many planes as possible

518
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,199
within a limited time.

519
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,400
If one doesn't understand
the goal thoroughly,

520
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
this will lead to one
making wrong decisions.

521
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,119
And then?

522
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,719
And then, keep watching.

523
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,040
I think Lu...

524
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,239
Lu's coding is too simple.

525
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,520
It seems like there are
a lot of loopholes.

526
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,839
That's not good.

527
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,079
Let me remind her.

528
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,880
It's too late now.

529
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,640
Old Ape.

530
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,199
All right.

531
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
Time's up.

532
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,800
Please leave the keyboard.

533
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:19,000
Both of you have completed the coding.

534
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,079
Now, please launch your aircraft

535
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:25,280
into the space.

536
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,319
Five minutes, starting in

537
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,839
three, two, one.

538
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,199
Start!

539
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,079
The Health Point of Lu's aircraft
is seeing a steep fall.

540
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,119
Yes.

541
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,160
Done.

542
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,959
She lost.

543
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,319
Yicheng.

544
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,400
Mr. Jiang...

545
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,839
It's not the end yet.

546
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,839
Lu will not necessarily lose.

547
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:15,439
Exactly.

548
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,119
Facts speak louder than words.

549
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:18,807
Just admit defeat.

550
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,800
Why are you being so mean?

551
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,319
You are the loser.

552
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,400
No. Mr. Jiang...

553
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I think you're mistaken.

554
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,680
The Health Point of Miss Li's aircraft

555
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,920
and the number of
the aircraft she shot down

556
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,520
are both ahead of her opponent's.

557
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,359
Exactly.

558
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,719
However, her robot is acting
too aggressively.

559
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,359
No...

560
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Isn't it good to be aggressive?

561
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,239
When you're designing

562
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,439
the strategy of an AI,

563
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,760
you can't focus only on the AI itself.

564
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,880
You need to also take into account
its surroundings.

565
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,319
The enemies in the game

566
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,640
know how to evaluate
the strength of their opponents.

567
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,359
The stronger their opponents are,

568
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,079
the more the fear.
They might even run away

569
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,359
to find a weaker opponent.

570
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,880
Indeed.

571
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,959
It's getting more and more difficult

572
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,400
for Miss Li's aircraft to
get near to the enemy aircraft.

573
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,239
They are now approaching
Lu Li's aircraft,

574
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,520
the one with lesser Health Point.

575
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,880
But, Lu's aircraft has
too little Health Point.

576
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,000
It seems like it's going to crash soon.

577
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,199
Look at the time.

578
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,280
Even if the aircraft crashes,

579
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:16,000
it won't leave the opponent
much time too.

580
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,479
You're right.

581
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
The goal of this game

582
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,319
is not to defend the aircraft,

583
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,560
but to bring down more enemies

584
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,239
within five minutes.

585
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,880
She intentionally lowered
her aircraft's Health Point.

586
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,800
She acted weak to get
the enemy aircraft to approach her,

587
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,880
and with that, to achieve more kills.

588
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,760
She's willing to
sacrifice her aircraft for this.

589
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,160
Lu is really smart.

590
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,319
Well done.

591
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
We'll definitely lose.

592
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
What are you talking about?

593
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,860
(Final score: Li Man 35, Lu Li 39)

594
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,280
39, 35.

595
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,640
We won.

596
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,199
I'm sweating.

597
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,199
Me too. It was really a tight match.

598
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,640
You won. Good job.

599
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,239
Those weren't flaws,

600
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,520
but baits.

601
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,199
I lost the game.

602
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,599
You beat me fair and square.

603
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,879
There are only a handful of people
who have beaten Miss Li fair and square.

604
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Koala Lu.

605
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,520
You made me proud.

606
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
It's just winning a game.

607
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,439
Let's see who has the last laugh.

608
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,719
The one who has the last laugh
is not necessarily the winner.

609
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,280
She could be the clown too.

610
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:23,560
Miss Li,

611
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,479
what you said just now
doesn't quite make sense.

612
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,840
Winning this game is important too.

613
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:30,520
For now,

614
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,080
this server belongs to us.

615
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:32,679
Don't worry.

616
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
We will make good use of it,

617
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:34,239
right?

618
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,120
Yes.

619
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,000
We'll make good use of it.

620
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,399
Miss Li's team will take the server.

621
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,879
Mr. Jiang, we made a deal.

622
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,719
The winner gets the server.

623
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,600
Besides, we need it

624
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,399
to develop "Xuan Zhong Ji".

625
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
I'm here to inform you

626
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,360
that you are no longer needed

627
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,679
in the development of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

628
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,479
Why?

629
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,800
I have other arrangements for you.

630
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,719
Besides,

631
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,040
although you're given permission
to use the server,

632
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,239
you have to work in the conference room.

633
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,199
Then, you can each mind
your own business.

634
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,760
Mr. Jiang,

635
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,639
didn't you say that you'd appoint Lu
as the lead programmer?

636
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,719
Moreover,

637
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,439
Lu has always been the one

638
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,919
liaising with the other departments.

639
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
You're removing her from the team
all of a sudden.

640
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,360
Is this...

641
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,159
This is the company's decision.

642
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,959
Lu Li will represent the company

643
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,919
and take part in the Game Design
Competition held by Netfalse.

644
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,360
Mr. Jiang, I need to talk to you.

645
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:42,840
Come to my office.

646
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,639
That...

647
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm sorry.

648
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,080
We'll head to the conference room.

649
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,560
Remember to send it to us later.

650
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,479
Take care.

651
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:58,239
Good job.

652
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Miss Li.

653
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,280
About that server...

654
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,760
We'll send it to you later.

655
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,399
Thanks.

656
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,639
It's okay.

657
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,040
I can't accept this.

658
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,719
I have accepted this.

659
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,760
What happened to
all your physical training?

660
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,560
Mr. Jiang.

661
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,439
When did you make this decision?

662
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,080
Why haven't you mentioned it before?

663
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,639
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

664
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,479
Can I help you?

665
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,399
I need to talk to you

666
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,600
about work.

667
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Wait a minute.

668
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:39,800
Sure.

669
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,239
The Netfalse competition doesn't have
a specific theme.

670
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,479
Someone will send you
the complete rules later.

671
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,560
The company only asks for one thing.

672
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,360
You have to get the champion.

673
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,520
Mr. Jiang.

674
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,719
I think it will be better

675
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,639
if you can assign this task
to another colleague.

676
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,679
I wish to continue my current job

677
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,879
and participate in the development
of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

678
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,600
This is the company's decision.

679
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,320
You shall just follow the orders.

680
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,560
I'll get colleagues
from other departments to help you out.

681
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,360
He's right, Lu Li.

682
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,879
Netfalse has promised

683
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,000
to provide talented projects

684
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,239
with incubator resources
and financial support.

685
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Besides, this contest

686
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,159
is the best and the fastest way

687
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,399
to make our company's name known.

688
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,199
If you can get the first place,

689
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,520
many companies in this industry

690
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,280
will notice Enchant Technology.

691
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:27,127
This can also help Yicheng

692
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,959
in winning more investors over.

693
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,520
Yicheng is working so hard
to win all the investors over,

694
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,919
because he wants to

695
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,280
free himself from his parents.

696
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,360
He doesn't want to be threatened

697
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,040
to make another choice that
he'll regret later.

698
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,000
You want me to take part in the
competition to earn more investment.

699
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,639
This is part of the reason.

700
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:53,919
The most important thing is

701
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,919
with "Xuan Zhong Ji",

702
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,399
you've already proven your ability

703
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,479
in planning and creating.

704
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,919
Therefore, I hope that...

705
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,679
Why was Lu Li running away?

706
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,919
I was about to ask you.

707
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,919
Why is her temper
getting worse and worse?

708
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,560
This is between you and her.

709
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
You shall settle it at home.

710
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,719
Lu Li is too young.

711
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,280
She doesn't know how to separate work
from her personal life.

712
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,719
You need to talk to her nicely.

713
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,120
Was she listening to
what I said just now?

714
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,320
I'll teach her a lesson when I get home.

715
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,120
You can do it however you like.

716
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:33,199
You don't have to explain
the details to us.

717
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,439
I'm still single.

718
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,479
I can't take this.

719
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,760
Are you done?

720
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,639
I'm here to talk to you
about the equipment.

721
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,199
I guess I shall talk to the
administration department directly.

722
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,239
You guys go ahead.

723
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,159
How can I help you?

724
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,679
I heard

725
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,239
that you removed Lu Li
from the "Xuan Zhong Ji" team.

726
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,239
You too.

727
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
You promised her

728
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,719
that if her proposal was approved,

729
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,159
you would make her the lead programmer.

730
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,120
Since you have made a promise,

731
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,639
you shouldn't break it.

732
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,639
Do you think I really want to do this?

733
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,800
EG was the one who was
against this idea.

734
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,199
Is this Li Man's idea?

735
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,719
She is EG's representative.

736
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,520
Her idea is EG's idea.

737
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,120
Lu Li indeed lacks experience.

738
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,560
However, she came up with the core idea.

739
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,959
She understands "Xuan Zhong Ji" the best.

740
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,000
That's why I made a deal with Li Man.

741
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,199
As long as Lu Li wins

742
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,439
the Netfalse competition,

743
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,919
EG won't oppose

744
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
her being the lead programmer
of "Xuan Zhong Ji" again.

745
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Judging from Lu Li's expression,

746
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:46,120
she has no idea about
what's actually going on.

747
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,959
Why didn't you explain it to her?

748
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,719
There was an outsider here.

749
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,959
I wasn't able to say anything.

750
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,760
What are you doing?

751
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,399
What's with this sinister smile?

752
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,600
Refusing to communicate

753
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,399
and an ineffective communication

754
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,399
will bring about regrets.

755
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,399
What's with all the philosophy?

756
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,879
Figure it out yourself.

757
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,040
Rubbish.

758
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:33,800
Rubbish.

759
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,760
Rubbish.

760
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,479
Rubbish.

761
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,439
Xiaoqi.

762
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:37,639
Who's there?

763
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,239
What are you doing here?

764
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,919
You haven't been visiting me.

765
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,719
Are you still angry with him?

766
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,399
Imagine there's a guy

767
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,399
always interfering
in your relationships,

768
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,800
how can you not be angry at him?

769
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,399
I always thought

770
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,399
my love radar was broken.

771
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,800
It turns out it's his brain
that's broken.

772
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,439
Have you ever wondered

773
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,679
why he is doing this?

774
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,280
Of course, I know.

775
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Because he is a Scorpio.

776
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,040
You don't know

777
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,959
how insanely controlling

778
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,639
he is.

779
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,439
He came to my place today
and told me not to get angry

780
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,919
over some unimportant persons.

781
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,320
You be the judge.

782
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,159
Is that a decent thing to say?

783
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,760
My mom likes him so much.

784
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm angry every time
I'm reminded of this.

785
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,239
I'm so angry.

786
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:38,560
Never mind.

787
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,600
Let's not talk about him.

788
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,639
By the way,

789
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,439
have you taken your dinner?

790
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,120
I haven't.

791
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,919
Great.

792
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,679
I can finally have a barbecue at home.

793
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:45,840
I'm afraid that I might not be able
to finish it by myself,

794
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,679
and I daren't order it.

795
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,919
What do you want?

796
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,959
Anything.

797
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,600
You decide.

798
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,239
Sure.

799
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,959
You're here.

800
00:41:58,959 --> 00:41:59,879
Xiaoqi,

801
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,360
what's wrong with the cat?

802
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,760
It doesn't seem like
it's in a good mood.

803
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,199
It's in estrus.

804
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,280
I've been looking for a partner for it.

805
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,120
If you know any handsome male cats,

806
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,159
do let me know.

807
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,740
(Jiang Yicheng)

808
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,740
(Jiang Yicheng)

809
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,260
(Shut down)

810
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,959
(Hi.)

811
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,760
(The number you've dialed
is unavailable.)

812
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,439
How dare she turn off her phone?

813
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,959
It's okay if you don't want
to pick up the call,

814
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,239
but how dare you turn off your phone?

815
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:40,840
Stupid Koala.

816
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,639
You're always annoying me.

817
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:50,199
Here.

818
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,280
Here.

819
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,399
Let's toast to our friendship.

820
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,199
This is the best.

821
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,280
Nothing beats

822
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,159
having a barbecue with my best friend.

823
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,800
All the men can go to hell.

824
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,439
Wait a minute.

825
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,840
You can't be drinking like this.

826
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,639
I'm thirsty.

827
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,120
You're smiling like this again.

828
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,679
You wear this smile

829
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,919
whenever you're pretending to be happy.

830
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,040
Li, what happened?

831
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:32,159
Did Jiang Yicheng bully you?

832
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:34,479
No.

833
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:35,959
Something happened

834
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
at work.

835
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,719
Work?

836
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,320
Do you think I'll believe you?

837
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,800
If it's just about work,

838
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,719
you would be sitting
in front of the computer,

839
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:46,199
analyzing your strength
and your weaknesses.

840
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,800
Have Jiang Yicheng and Li Man
got back together?

841
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:04,639
(The difference between
men and machines is that)

842
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,600
(men get manipulated by emotions.)

843
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,199
(That's why we can't always be rational)

844
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,639
(like the machines.)
