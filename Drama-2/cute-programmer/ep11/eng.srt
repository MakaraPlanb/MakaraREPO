Brother Lei.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
Did I scare you?

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,039
Are you all right?

25
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,399
I'm okay.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,600
My best friend.

27
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:27,240
You look especially beautiful today.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,199
You're acting unaccountably nice.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,479
Can we have a word?

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,039
I...

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,800
I only want to know

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,199
if Xiaoqi has a boyfriend.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,279
What are you planning?

34
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,399
I think

35
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,240
a pretty and cute girl like her

36
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,279
needs to be protected.

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,039
Can you send me her contact?

38
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,800
I need to get her permission first.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,479
Of course.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course, you have to.

41
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:01,839
Ask her now.

42
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,600
Now.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,839
I'll wait for you.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,360
I've sent it to you.

45
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,600
It only took her an instant to reply.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,039
I'll buy you a meal.

47
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,880
Da Huang.

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,800
Didn't Mr. Jiang tell us

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
to keep a distance
from colleagues of opposite genders?

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,320
Where did you put your hand?

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,080
I...

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
I was just...

53
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,720
I was asking her...

54
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,360
I was sentimental.

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,320
Sure.

56
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,440
Get ready.

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,399
The investor will be right here.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,960
Hurry up.

59
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,199
Sure.

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,919
Brother Lei.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,440
Are you ready?

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,880
Yes.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,880
Here.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,440
This is the demo.

65
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,399
Sure.

66
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,399
Mr. Jiang

67
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,839
is wearing a checkered shirt.

68
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,639
It shows that

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,839
Mr. Jiang is determined

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
to win EG over.

71
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,320
Those who don't know will think that
you're going to seduce them.

72
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,720
That's part of my plan too.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,240
I'll sacrifice my body
to win our investor over.

74
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,880
They are here.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
The investor is a lady.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
A young and beautiful investor.

77
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,920
Mr. Jiang is truly blessed.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,519
This is my first time seeing
such a beautiful investor.

79
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,839
It's you?

80
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,079
Mr. Jiang.

81
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,679
I am the representative of EG Gaming,

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,799
Li Man.

83
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,079
Senior Yiming.

84
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,440
It's been a while.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
That's too flattering.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,959
Miss Li is a distinguished guest.

87
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,880
You shall just address me
by my position title.

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
I've long heard about

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
your company's rising reputation
in the domestic industry.

90
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,359
I'm here to observe and learn

91
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,880
from the products
of Mr. Jiang's company.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
Hopefully,

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
we'll get to work together.

94
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,559
I don't want to waste your time.

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,760
We won't work with you.

96
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,000
Mr. Jiang.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,040
What do you mean?

98
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,320
Yicheng.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Can we talk in private?

100
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,679
Sure.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,279
We'll talk here.

102
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,760
Please

103
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,519
come with me.

104
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,160
Let's give them some privacy.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,200
Sure.

106
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,359
The bosses are having a talk.

107
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,799
We shall give them some privacy.

108
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,440
He told you to leave.

109
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,640
What are you looking at?

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,559
What's wrong with Mr. Jiang today?

111
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,880
We spent so much time preparing this.

112
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,679
How could he reject
the collaboration so easily?

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,880
If you want to talk about collaboration,

114
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,119
I only have one thing to say.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,880
I decline it.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,440
It's been three years
since we last saw each other.

117
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
You're still as decisive as before.

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,799
You haven't changed at all.

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm definitely not as fickle as Miss Li.

120
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,320
Did you decline the collaboration
because of me?

121
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,279
What else can it be?

122
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,799
You don't want to collaborate with me

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
because you can't see me

124
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,880
purely as a business partner.

125
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,760
Am I right?

126
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,760
You've overcomplicated it.

127
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,399
I simply don't want
to work with a dishonest person.

128
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,839
Yicheng.

129
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,480
How can I get you to forgive me?

130
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,679
If Miss Li wants to catch up with me,

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,920
I have nothing to say to you.

132
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,880
You're afraid of working with me

133
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,519
because you haven't got over me.

134
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,640
You've overestimated yourself.

135
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,720
Do you need me to remind you

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,239
of what happened three years ago?

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,480
Then, why did you refuse

138
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,359
to recruit female programmers
before this?

139
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,079
Yicheng.

140
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,160
I came back for you.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Can we start all over again?

142
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,440
We can't.

143
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,839
Haven't you been staying single

144
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,279
because of me?

145
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,239
Because of you?

146
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,359
Did you see the female programmer
in our office?

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Lu Li.

How did you win Mr. Jiang's heart?

167
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,960
When did you start dating each other?

168
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,320
Why haven't I noticed anything?

169
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,599
Who took the initiative?

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
We...

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,039
Our parents matched us up.

172
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,200
Now I know why

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,000
you're the only exception
in our department.

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,799
You've even met each other's parents.

175
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,239
You are so good at keeping secrets.

176
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,359
You're too lucky.

177
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,679

interceded with the boss

178

on your behalf.

179
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,119
Exactly.

180
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:16,640

181
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,520
Lu.

182
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,280

183
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799

184

We're not in a hurry.

185
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,320
Not in a hurry?

186
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,840
If you don't act fast,

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,039
someone else will
snatch Mr. Jiang away from you.

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,760
He's right.

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
shares a special relationship
with Miss Investor.

191
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,200
Precisely.

192
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,760
Am I right?

193
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,640
Do you know who Miss Li is?

194
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,280
Miss Li?

195
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,599
Let's look it up.

196
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,320
Let me look it up.

197
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:39,760
Li Man.

198
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Twenty-seven years old.

199
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,039
Graduated from the Faculty of Computer
Science at the University of Xinhai.

200
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,039
She went abroad to further her studies
three years ago.

201
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,880
She's now the senior manager

202
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,760
of the EG Gaming Investment Department.

203
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,080
This is all the information
we could acquire legally.

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
It's obvious now.

205
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,919
That's why she called Mr. Chen senior.

206
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,039
She probably met Mr. Jiang

207
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
during their college days.

208
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,400
She's likely Mr. Jiang's ex-girlfriend.

209
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,840
Has Mr. Jiang told you

210
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,119
anything about his ex-girlfriend?

211
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Yes.

212
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,000
Ex...

213
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,559
Where did Brother Lei go?

214
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,080
Lei...

215
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,640
He probably went to the washroom.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,159
I'm sure he has a weak bladder.

217
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,119
That will make him bald too.

218
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,159
You know what.

219
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,599
You never care about balding.

220
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,799
Brother Lei.

221
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:31,760
You need to take care of this.

222
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,760
Old... Old Ape.

223
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,719
For this, we need to start young.

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,640
Da Huang.

225
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:43,799
He's so handsome.

226
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,200
This is a nice angle.

227
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,840
That's true.

228
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,479
He looks so manly.

229
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,119
Oh, my God.

230
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:48,840
He's so sexy.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,039
What are you looking at?

232
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,679
Mr. Jiang's photo
exposing his relationship.

233
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,200
I didn't expect him to go this far.

234
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,119
Precisely.

235
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,239
Let me take a look.

236
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,520
Miss Jiang.

237
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,799
We didn't take this photo.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,080
It was circulated in the chatroom.

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,479
This...

240
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,239
Any more photos?

241
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,919
Send them to me.

242
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,719
My mom will be elated
when she sees this.

243
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,640
This is the only photo.

244
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,719
This...

245
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,239
Why was she there?

246
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,400
When was this photo taken?

247
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
I think it was taken just now.

248
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,479
Just now...

249
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,960
Just now?

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,799
Hurry up.

251
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,799
Let's go.

252
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,719
My...

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,719
Miss Jiang.

254
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,760
My phone.

255
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,320
My phone.

256
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,599
Li Man.

257
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Wait for me in the car.

258
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,200
Zitong.

259
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,719
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,599
I didn't have the time
to drop by and say hello.

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,559
It doesn't matter.

262
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,640
We're not on speaking terms anyway.

263
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm only here

264
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,760
to warn you

265
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
not to disturb my brother anymore.

266
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,400
It doesn't matter what happened
to Yicheng and me.

267
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,840
Can't we stay friends?

268
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,599
The day you betrayed my brother

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,960
and left him without a word

270
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
was the day our friendship ended.

271
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,760
You probably won't believe
what I'm going to say.

272
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,599
But I never intended to hurt any of you.

273
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,799
You were my best friend.

274
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,159
Yiming is the senior I trusted the most.

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
Yicheng

276
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,960
was the person I loved the most.

277
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
Save it.

278
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,799
You love yourself the most.

279
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
Be honest.

280
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,520
What do you want to get
from my brother this time?

281
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I'm here to make it up to him.

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,280
But I didn't expect
to see him with a new girlfriend.

283
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,679
That's why

284
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,320
I suggest you give up.

285
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,640
My brother and Lu Li
have a very good relationship.

286
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,880
But I heard that your brother
went on blind dates not long ago.

287
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,320
I suppose they just got together.

288
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,479
So what?

289
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,159
Even if they have only been dating
each other for around two weeks,

290
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,000
my brother will never get
affected by you.

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,559
So, it's only two weeks.

292
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,520
Anyway, I'm warning you

293
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,080
not to bother my brother anymore.

294
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
This is bad.

295
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,159
Yiming.

296
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,479
Something went wrong.

297
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,359
Calm down.

298
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,400
What happened?

299
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,760
I wanted to threaten Li Man.

300
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,559
But I accidentally told her

301
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,320
that Yicheng

302
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,599
only just started dating Lu Li.

303
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,000
I...

304
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,280
Did I make a mistake?

305
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,039
I reckon Li Man came back
for your brother.

306
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,559
Even if you didn't spill the beans,

307
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,559
she would discover the truth
from someone else.

308
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,960
How audacious of her

309
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,320
to come looking for my brother?

310
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,919
She used to be quite thin-skinned.

311
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,880
A few years have passed.

312
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,039
Not only has she grown some wrinkles,

313
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,719
but her skin has also grown thicker.

314
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,239
This is between your brother and her.

315
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,719
We shall leave it to your brother.

316
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,239
It will be better
if we can stay away from this.

317
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,320
Sure.

318
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,280
I'll do as you say.

319
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Why are you staring at me?

320
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,039
Because you look good.

321
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,359
Zitong.

322
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,479
We need to talk about work.

323
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,479
Do you know what your
department is up to?

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,239
I think they are coming up
with a tagline for the game.

325
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,719
They completed it a long time ago.

326
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,640
Why are you showing concern
to our department?

327
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,320
I'm not showing concern to them.

328
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,919
It's just that you're
acting too unconcerned.

329
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,280
You are very blessed and privileged.

330
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,359
You said a few words,
and you got a position

331
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,479
others have to work hard
for years to reach.

332
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,400
Look at yourself.

333
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,440
You're occupying a position
others longing for,

334
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,640
and what have you done?

335
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,200
But...

336
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,080
They don't really need me.

337
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,880
Then, why are you here?

338
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm here to win your heart.

339
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,760
I've spent all my energy

340
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,080
on you.

341
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,000
Can I only be praised when I work hard?

342
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,239
Is it wrong to put in my effort
to get your attention?

343
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,760
I'll get you another cup of coffee.

344
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,280
Miss Man.

345
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,799
Are you all right?

346
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,119
I didn't expect today to be a good day.

347
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,599
But I didn't expect
it would be this bad too.

348
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,719
Mr. Jiang is a difficult man.

349
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,200
But he looks much
more handsome in person.

350
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,119
He used to have a worse temper.

351
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,679
Whenever he faced challenges
during coding,

352
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,000
no one in the company dared
utter a word.

353
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,880
But he looks way more mature now.

354
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,479
The female staff in his company

355
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,119
looks very ordinary.

356
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,080
She's no match for you.

357
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,760
She resembles my old self.

358
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,200
Didn't you say

359
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,119
that Mr. Jiang had been single
for the past few years?

360
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,159
Perhaps,

361
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,559
he found someone who resembles you

362
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,840
to upset you on purpose.

363
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,400
(Will she be upset
because I kissed her out of the blue?)

364
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
Li Man gave me a call.

365
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,319
She invited us for dinner.

366
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
She specifically asked you
to bring along your girlfriend.

367
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
You can go ahead if you want.

368
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,079
We won't be there.

369
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,920
She wants to see

370
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,000
if you're really dating Lu Li,

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
or it's just a lie.

372
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,520
Send me the address.

373
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,280
Everyone.

374
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,400
Listen up.

375
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
Make sure

376
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,640
to clean every corner.

377
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:50,880
Brother Lei.

378
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
Pay more attention

379
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,199
to Lu's place.

380
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,160
If the dust clogs your hair follicles,

381
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,199
it will cause seborrheic hair loss.

382
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,319
Yes.

383
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,680
It doesn't matter if we lose our hair.

384
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,920
How can our boss' future wife
suffer from hair loss?

385
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,119
Leave this to me.

386
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,160
You can take a rest.

387
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,599
Lu.

388
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,199
This job fits me just right.

389
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,199
It helps in relieving stress.

390
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,079
(Work plan)
I'll do it.

391
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,319
You can take a rest.

392
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,640
Leader Zhang.

393
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,040
Leader Zhang.

394
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,000
Do you need anything?

395
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,479
Yes. We do.

396
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,079
I need a new keyboard.

397
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,239
Didn't you get a new keyboard
early this year?

398
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,800
But Lu Li...

399
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,439
I think your computer is two years old.

400
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
I'll get you a new one later.

401
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,160
That's not necessary.

402
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,760
I work well with this one.

403
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,000
It's okay.

404
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,959
Besides, it's so dangerous
to sit in this chair.

405
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,839
We have a chair
similar to Mr. Jiang's in the store.

406
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,839
You can use it.

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,479
Yes.

408
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,359
That's not necessary.

409
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,239
You don't need to give me
any special treatment.

410
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,359
Mr. Jiang won't get affected

411
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,520
by what you do to me.

412
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,199
I can't change his mind.

413
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,880
We shall stay the same.

414
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,119
We saw

415
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,680
how well Mr. Jiang treated you.

416
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,199
You will definitely

417
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
be our boss' future wife.

418
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,839
Yes.

419
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,359
You can't make jokes like this.

420
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,959
Mr. Jiang doesn't like to
mention his personal affairs

421
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,319
at work.

422
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,040
Don't mention it again.

423
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,439
There are so many of you here.

424
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,959
Mr. Jiang.

425
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,119
We're here to check the supplies.

426
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,560
Yes.

427
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,439
Get back to work then.

428
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,439
Lu Li.

429
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,359
We'll have dinner together later.

430
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,680
He came here personally
to ask you out for dinner.

431
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,199
Lu Li.

432
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,760
Mr. Jiang does care a lot about you.

433
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,959
Precisely.

434
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
All the girls in the company

435
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
will have their hearts broken.

436
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,839
Exactly.

437
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,719
Don't forget to pass us
the wedding candy

438
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,680
when you get married.

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,319
Remember to pass us the wedding candy.

440
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,199
Wedding candy.

441
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,040
Let's go.

442
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,599
Wedding candy.

443
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,280
Lu Li.

444
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,719
Lu Li.

445
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,640
Send us your wedding candy.

446
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Let's go.

447
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Mr. Jiang is torturing
all the single men in public.

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,800
No.

449
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,760
There's no need for that.

450
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,599
Excuse me.

451
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,079
It's much clearer now.

452
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:18,800
There's some dust here.

453
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
It's dusty here.

454
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,599
Xiaoqi.

455
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,800
Sorry

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,800
to have kept you waiting.

457
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,160
I came early.

458
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Where's Lu Li?

459
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,239
She's on a date with Mr. Jiang.

460
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,839
It's just the two of us now.

461
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,920
You know about her and Jiang Yicheng...

462
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,079
We just found out today.

463
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,599
When Mr. Jiang publicly announced

464
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,959
that Lu Li was his girlfriend,

465
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,359
we were all astounded.

466
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,359
What do you want to eat?

467
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,760
I...

468
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,719
I'll buy you a meal.

469
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,119
Xiaoqi.

470
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Why are you here?

471
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm not here for you.

472
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Director Gu, you...

473
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,239
Do you know each other?

474
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,760
He's my brother.

475
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,719
Where are you going?

476
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,560
We're going to grab some food.

477
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Do you want to join us?

478
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,439
Why did you invite him along?

479
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
He'll ruin my appetite.

480
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,000
All right.

481
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,239
I have no plan for dinner yet.

482
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,079
Let's go together.

483
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,760
He... He's so bold.

484
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,239
Director Gu seems quite distant
in the office.

485
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
He's really caring in private.

486
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,520
He's a germophobe.

487
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,359
He's not only troublesome,

488
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,560
but also controlling.

489
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,599
Why don't you call me controlling

490
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,239
when I clean up the house for you?

491
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,160
You insist on cleaning it up, okay?

492
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:41,839
Here.

493
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,800
Have some meat.

494
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,760
You're so thin.

495
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,920
Are you on a diet?

496
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,079
She's on a diet.

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,920
Instead of eating satisfyingly,

498
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,079
she now eats fearfully.

499
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,319
Gu Mo.

500
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,599
Do you have to ruin my image

501
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
in front of my new friend?

502
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm only stating the facts.

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,400
You should stay true to yourself.

504
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,160
After all, you won't be able
to maintain this fake image for long.

505
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,839
This is my first time hearing
so many words from Director Gu.

506
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,680
Now you know how two-faced he is.

507
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,239
He

508
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,800
is really pompous.

509
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,400
He always

510
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,040
plays an obedient boy
in front of our parents.

511
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,439
This has been affecting me

512
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,560
since I was a kid.

513
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
I see...

514
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,920
Acting differently in front of different
people doesn't make me a hypocrite.

515
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,280
This only proves my capability.

516
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,199
Thanks.

517
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,400
You're really capable
of annoying others.

518
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,000
I...

519
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,199
I'll go get the bill.

520
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,359
I suppose

521
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,239
there was a traffic jam.

522
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,439
Let's wait for a while more.

523
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
They'll be here soon.

524
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you want any juice?

525
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:17,800
I'll order it for you.

526
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,359
It's okay.

527
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,719
Yicheng.

528
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,640
You're here.

529
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,359
Have a seat.

530
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,000
Sure.

531
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:24,839
Lu Li.

532
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,520
You can sit here.

533
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,119
Yicheng.

534
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,319
I'm very happy to have you here.

535
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,319
Didn't you say you want to meet Lu Li?

536
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,560
I brought her along.

537
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:40,760
Miss Lu.

538
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,640
Please excuse us.

539
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
It's been a few years
since Yicheng, Yiming, and I

540
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
last met each other.

541
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,439
I just found out

542
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
that Yicheng has gotten himself
a girlfriend.

543
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,599
Therefore, I really wanted to meet you.

544
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,359
In the meantime,
I can catch up with my old friends too.

545
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,359
Miss Li.

546
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,359
I'm too flattered.

547
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,479
You've just returned home from abroad.

548
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,319
We should be the ones hosting you.

549
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,800
The food is getting cold.

550
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
We'll talk as we eat.

551
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,800
Yes.

552
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,959
Let's eat.

553
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't be shy.

554
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,640
The soup is nice.

555
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
I ordered it just for you.

556
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,359
Let me stick the patch for you.

557
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,599
All done.

558
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,439
You have always had neck pain.

559
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,520
Did you fail to take good care
of your neck during the past few years?

560
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,880
I bought

561
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,359
a really nice neck massager there.

562
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I'll pass it to you.

563
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,520
It's okay.

564
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,319
Lu Li can give me a massage.

565
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,959
I know how much you like seafood.

566
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,520
That's why I picked this restaurant.

567
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,800
The shrimps arrived by air today.

568
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,800
Give it a taste.

569
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,079
You should try it too.

570
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,599
The shrimps are quite fresh.

571
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,560
Give it a taste.

572
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,359
Lu Li.

573
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,800
Aren't you allergic to seafood?

574
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,160
Are you allergic to seafood?

575
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,280
I was.

576
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,599
I'm all good now.

577
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Do you remember when
we first started our business?

578
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,079
We went to the seaside
for a team-building activity.

579
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,599
We planned to catch
some seafood and grill it.

580
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
We didn't manage to catch any fish,

581
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,719
but Yicheng's hand was hurt by the crab.

582
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,280
I cried all the way to the hospital.

583
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,680
Is the scar

584
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,719
still there?

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,319
That was a long time ago.

586
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,520
The scar is long gone.

587
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,959
Eat up.

588
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,199
I need to use the bathroom.

589
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,079
You stay here.

590
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,359
I'll go to the bathroom too.

591
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,079
I knew you'd come after me.

592
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,319
Are you done recalling the past?

593
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,479
If you want to cause a rift
between Lu Li and me

594
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,839
and separate us,

595
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,680
you'll be disappointed.

596
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,439
Even if you refuse to forgive me,

597
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,640
you don't have to put up a show.

598
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,760
I know that you haven't known
each other for long.

599
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,239
You don't know her at all.

600
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,520
Does it matter how long
we've known each other?

601
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,359
We've known each other for a long time.

602
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
But do I really know you?

603
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,599
Do you really like her?

604
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
If you have feelings for her,

605
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,199
why didn't you know about
her seafood allergies?

606
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,040
I can get to know her better
in the future.

607
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,760
She's just a girl.

608
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,920
What can she give you?

609
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,839
Can she help you build your career?

610
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,479
Yicheng.

611
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,839
She's not the one for you.

612
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,479
Then, who's the one?

613
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,920
The person who betrayed our company,

614
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,760
her boyfriend,

615
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,439
and ran away with the fund?

616
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,199
I'm here to tell you

617
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,439
that it's over.

618
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,479
I won't have anything
to do with you in the future.

619
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,839
I need to use the bathroom too.

620
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,079
That's not true.

621
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,199
I'm sure you still have feelings for me.

622
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Please behave yourself.

623
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,640
How's the allergic reaction?

624
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,239
You knew about your allergies.

625
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,319
Yet you ate the shrimps.

626
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,839
I've never seen someone
as foolish as you.

627
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:01,000
Jiang Yicheng has feelings
for Miss Li, right?

628
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,400
You should ask the guy himself.

629
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,439
You know them the best.

630
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,439
You can answer me
from an objective point of view.

631
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,680
The only thing
I can tell you confidently

632
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,040
is that they used to date each other.

633
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,760
Did Miss Li come back

634
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,760
because she wanted to
get back together with Jiang Yicheng?

635
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,880
You are now married to Yicheng.

636
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,599
Nothing will happen between them.

637
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,760
If we end our marriage,

638
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,760
will they get back together?

639
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
How can you end a marriage so easily?

640
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,920
It's difficult to end a real marriage,

641
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,640
but not a fake one.

642
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,079
What are you talking about?

643
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,400
Jiang Yicheng and I
have a contract-based marriage.

644
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,479
This is why he said

645
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,760
that it's complicated.

646
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,040
Yicheng's family wanted him
to get married.

647
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,959
I can understand why he got married.

648
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,839
But why did you agree to that?

649
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I got to know Jiang Yicheng
a long time ago

650
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,400
through a game named "Dream Maker".

651
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,199
It has been...

652
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,719
five years since I fell for him.

653
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,400
You joined the company
because of Yicheng.

654
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,880
I couldn't understand

655
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,359
why did you agree to that arrangement.

656
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,920
I didn't expect this to be the reason.

657
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,560
I read a quote

658
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,160
from Shakespeare before.

659
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,640
When we can't afford happiness,

660
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,800
we should never walk
too close to the window.

661
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,760
I thought

662
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,800
my happiness was within reach,

663
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,439
but I was actually standing outside
the window the whole time.

664
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,119
Lu Li.

665
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,119
We earn what we fight for.

666
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,800
I earned myself a year.

667
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
At least, for the coming year,

668
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,599
he's mine.

669
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,839
But plans always fall behind changes.

670
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,800
You have to believe in Yicheng.

671
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:33,319
If he can't give you
the affection you want,

672
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,719
you have to believe in him.

673
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,920
What are you doing?

674
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,160
I'm comforting her as a friend.

675
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,239
Why do you need comfort?

676
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,079
Her husband brought her along
to meet his ex-girlfriend.

677
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,479
Anyone will get upset too.

678
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,199
Husband?

679
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:55,760
Senior.

680
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
What do you mean?

681
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,560
Isn't she Yicheng's girlfriend?

682
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,959
I've never said that she's my girlfriend.

683
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,599
Let me introduce her again.

684
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,560
She's my wife.

685
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:17,920
Lu Li.

686
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,560
We shall go.

687
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,920
Li Man.

688
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,880
Senior.

689
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:13,880
I've got to go.

690
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,400
Have you ever regretted what you did?

691
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,719
When I was abroad,

692
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,719
I lived every day in regret

693
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,079
and talking myself out of the regret.

694
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
The only thing

695
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,640
I regret

696
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,719
is letting you join the company.

697
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,839
If it wasn't for you,

698
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,280
Yicheng might have already become

699
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
the top in the gaming industry.

700
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,800
If I had a choice,

701
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,239
I wouldn't have done what I did.

702
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,719
I don't want to know
the reason behind your doing.

703
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:51,119
What has happened, has happened.

704
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,280
What matters now is the present
and the future.

705
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,959
You saw it yourself.

706
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,520
Yicheng has started all over again.

707
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:58,880
I hope

708
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:02,040
you can do the same too.

709
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,800
You have said so much,

710
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,679
and all you want is for me to give up.

711
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:10,600
Yes.

712
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,080
I came back for Yicheng.

713
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,399
But I don't like interfering in
others' marriages.

714
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,040
I only found out about this.

715
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,840
I need some time to process this.

716
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,159
I've got to go.

717
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,320
Wait a minute.

718
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,760
I didn't tell you
about the dinner beforehand

719
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,639
because...

720
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,199
Is she the female programmer
who ditched you?

721
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,919
Although we are legally married,

722
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,840
you can't speculate about my past.

723
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,760
I didn't speculate.

724
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,360
I only have to apply some logic.

725
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,360
You took care of me in front of Miss Li.

726
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Weren't you trying to
use me as an excuse?

727
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,719
Then, what about you and Chen Yiming?

728
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,399
He was comforting me.

729
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,239
Why did he have to comfort you?

730
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
It was about work.

731
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,800
If it was about work,
why did he have to hug you?

732
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,959
If there is anything more serious,

733
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,600
will you cheat on me?

734
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Li Man and you...

735
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,000
There's nothing between us.

736
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,080
You haven't answered me.

737
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,600
I don't want to answer
all these ridiculous questions.

738
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,439
Let me go.

739
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,360
(Lu Li.)

740
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,800
(Aren't you allergic to seafood?)

741
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,060
(Jiuzhou Pharmacy)

742
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:30,719
(Hi.)

743
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,000
(Do you have any medicine
for seafood allergies?)

744
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,199
(Are you the patient?)

745
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,959
No.

746
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:34,560
It's for my wife.

747
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,399
She took a bite of the shrimp
and has got rashes all over her neck.

748
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,199
This is for topical application.

749
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,840
Don't scratch it to avoid inflammation.

750
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,159
Is there anything else
I should pay attention to?

751
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,320
Before she recovers,

752
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,840
she should avoid spicy food.

753
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,439
If it gets worse,
it's advised to seek medical help.

754
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,439
Thank you.

755
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,679
What a fool.

756
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,600
You shouldn't eat the seafood
if you can't.

757
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,000
That...

758
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,679
I bought you breakfast.

759
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,399
The doctor advised you
to eat healthy and light food.

760
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,639
Didn't she see the ointment
I bought for her?

761
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,560
Where are you going?

762
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,080
Are you going to walk?

763
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,120
She's giving me the cold shoulder.

764
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,239
Do as you please.

765
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,120
I can't be bothered to drive you around.

766
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,600
I'm already giving in.

767
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,280
Yet, she didn't appreciate it.

768
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,280
I won't apologize

769
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,879
again.

770
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,679
Koala Lu is usually quite tractable.

771
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,000
Why is she so angry this time?

772
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,620
(Koala gets angry)

773
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,840
I personally think that
Koala is a docile animal.

774
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,520
It's unlikely that it will get angry.

775
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,919
It's really unlikely
that she will get angry.

776
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
But once she's angry,

777
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,560
she's really fierce.

778
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,120
If you want the correct answer,

779
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,959
you can approach Koala itself.

780
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:26,800
What a lousy answer.

781
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,560
(Koala got angry because it was drenched)

782
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,439
(The koala was drenched by accident.)
The resemblance is uncanny.

783
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,140
(Sorry)

784
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,560
(Sorry.)

785
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,439
I'm the boss.

786
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,000
She is my staff.

787
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,080
She should be the one

788
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,719
apologizing to me.

789
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,879
No.

790
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,620
(Come to the office)

791
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:23,360
(Come to the office)

792
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,919
(We're all afraid
of losing the person we love.)

793
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,040
(When we fall for someone,)

794
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,879
(we often become humble.)

795
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,120
(However, we forget that
if we keep chasing after the light,)

796
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:56,959
(the light will never see us.)
