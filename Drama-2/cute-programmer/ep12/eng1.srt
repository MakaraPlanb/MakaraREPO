21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,760
(Come to the office.)

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,639
My children,

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,440
come.

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
Come and have a try.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,360
Your sister-in-law made you guys
some biscuits.

26
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,279
Biscuits?

27
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,520
Come.

28
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,839
Where's Brother Lei?

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,199
He went to the washroom.

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,960
He's been acting like that lately.

31
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,160
He goes to the washroom early morning.

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
Is he experiencing a
deficiency of the kidneys

33
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:25,559
because he did that too much?

34
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,520
Don't speak nonsense.

35
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:27,839
Lu.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Lu.

37
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,559
Come.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Have some biscuits.

39
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,240
It's nice, right?

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,919
Old Ape,

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,839
I have a question for you.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,600
What does it feel like to have a wife?

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,479
You're starting this again.

44
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,839
I just want a relationship
without any bugs in it.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
Why is it that hard to do so?

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
A relationship without any bugs?

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
You should act like Lu Li.

48
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,919
You can find a peer.

49
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,679
Maybe you can fix the bugs together.

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,960
Good idea.

51
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm not a patch.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Why do you only think of me
when you think of bugs?

53
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,600
Do you know the incident with Mr. Jiang?

54
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,199
What incident?

55
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,839
Do you know who Li Man is?

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Yeah.

57
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,320
You mustn't be careless.

58
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,240
Do you remember

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,759
why everyone in our team
has to stay single?

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,199
Did you have a meal with
Xiaoqi yesterday?

61
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,240
A meal with Xiaoqi?

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
This...

63
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,600
Lu Li,

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,360
so,

65
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,479
did Xiaoqi

66
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,479
tell you about her impression of me?

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,080
She...

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,960
Lu Li!

69
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:25,800
Didn't you see my message?

70
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,759
I told you to come to my office.

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,160
I didn't.

72
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,199
What's wrong?

73
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,440
Have you fixed the game UI?

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
I sent it to you last night.

75
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,240
What about the program
for the battle system?

76
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,960
Brother Lei and I are
responsible for that.

77
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,320
Didn't you tell us to hand it
to you by next week?

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah.

79
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,199
Do you want some biscuits?

80
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,240
You guys are not allowed to have
breakfast in the office anymore.

81
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,240
This isn't breakfast.

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,279
This is a snack.

83
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,759
If so, no snacks for
you guys from now on.

84
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
Did you argue with Mr. Jiang?

85
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:55,600
I didn't,

86
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,919
but a bug did appear.

87
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,000
A bug?

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,600
A bug?

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,520
What kind of bug?

90
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,160
A bug?

91
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,420
(Lu Li)

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,820
(Settings)

93
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,580
(Add to blacklist)

94
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,440
If I approach you again,

95
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll be a dumb koala like you.

96
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,000
Seems like Xiaoqi

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,920
will never need to worry about
your relationship again.

98
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,519
What?

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,279
You guys made quite an impact with
the official announcement yesterday.

100
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,279
Congratulations.

101
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,519
There's nothing for you
to congratulate me about.

102
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,559
Did something happen again?

103
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,320
Life is just like programming.

104
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:51,440
Bugs will always appear out of nowhere.

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,480
Aren't you a programmer, are you?

106
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,480
Yeah.

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
But I don't know

108
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,959
how to solve every kind of problem.

109
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,480
Director Gu,

110
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,200
if someone more suitable than you

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,519
appears beside the person you fancy,

112
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,480
and that person understands her better,

113
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,399
what will you do by then?

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,359
Simple.

115
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,079
I'll find his weaknesses

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,720
and try to eliminate him from the game.

117
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,279
You're that direct?

118
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,040
Do you want to show mercy
to your love rival?

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,200
What if

120
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,040
you're the person who's eliminated?

121
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,480
This result doesn't exist in my dictionary.

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
Because I know

123
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm the best candidate for her.

124
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,720
(I'm the best candidate for her?)

125
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,600
Mr. Jiang.

126
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,239
Miss Li isn't coming today.

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,760
Do you need anything?

128
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,480
In the future, I'll be representing her

129
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,799
to discuss official matters.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Mr. Jiang, I hope you can
give it a second thought

131
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,559
and separate work from personal matters.

132
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,839
Please.

133
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,519
Mr. Liu,

134
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,839
our company is accepting investments
from other companies

135
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,160
to strengthen our foundation.

136
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,480
But we won't let other investments
affect our company's autonomy.

137
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,839
I hope you can understand that.

138
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,920
I understand.

139
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,799
My company expects
great things from your company.

140
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,000
That's why they still sent me here
to negotiate a deal

141
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,200
even after yesterday's
unpleasant meeting.

142
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm here to represent
our company's sincerity.

143
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,320
This is my company's evaluation

144
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
of Enchant Technology's current games.

145
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,519
What do you mean by this?

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Mr. Jiang,

147
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,679
the game industry just
went through a tough time.

148
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,839
Due to unsustainable sales

149
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,799
and the unpredictability of
popular games,

150
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,880
actually, many investment companies

151
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,040
don't acknowledge the long-term value
game companies can produce.

152
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,079
That is their own prejudice.

153
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,600
Although the bonus period
for game companies is over,

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
for the past few years,

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,839
our industry has maintained
a steady growth rate.

156
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,559
I believe your company

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
is investing in us because of that.

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
But when it comes to the game industry,
it is one of

159
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,079
The Cultural and Creative Industries.

160
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,640
Innovation is required
to boost its growth.

161
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,440
According to our company's evaluation,

162
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,839
the IPs your company has created

163
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,920
are homogeneous with
similar products on the market.

164
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,920
Its life cycle cannot sustain
continuous development.

165
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,239
So, you want us to develop new games?

166
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Our company

167
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,760
doesn't want to make a bet
on your current products indeed.

168
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,600
Although innovation is required
to boost its growth,

169
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,440
it comes with risks.

170
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,959
We have absolute trust in
Enchant Technology's core team.

171
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,359
Once my company gives the green light
to your new game proposal,

172
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,480
not only will we invest in
your company immediately,

173
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,959
we will use our distribution channels
in other countries

174
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,320
to globalise your new game.

175
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,399
This is an important matter.

176
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Mr. Jiang, you can give me an answer
after a few days.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,679
No need.

178
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,320
I'll give you my answer right away.

179
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,359
I agree with it.

180
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,279
Can I know why you've made
your decision immediately?

181
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,239
Because once we succeed,

182
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,359
our market value will
increase exponentially.

183
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,359
In this world, there are no risks
we can conquer

184
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,679
without taking any risks.

185
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
Mr. Jiang, you're
a straightforward man indeed.

186
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
I'll wait for your good news then.

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,380
(EG Game Company Heng Rui Liu)

188
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,180
(Enchant Technology Game Evaluation)

189
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,960
How did it go?

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Miss Li,

191
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,280
Jiang Yicheng has agreed to it.

192
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,159
Great job.

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,239
Miss Li,

194
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,520
I do think Enchant Technology
has several

195
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,000
noteworthy games.

196
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,679
Some of them are better than the games
we can find in the market.

197
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,440
Why did you make me tell him

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
that the company didn't like them

199
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,919
and wanted them to develop new games?

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
Do you think they're noteworthy?

201
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,919
I think they're not good enough.

202
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,359
Jiang Yicheng is more capable

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,919
than that.

204
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,679
So, you want to stimulate his potential

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,719
and help our company
reap the biggest profit?

206
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,960
I understand now.

207
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,880
Look at you.

208
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,799
My daughter does sound like
a capable person now.

209
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,960
What's the saying again?

210
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,679
A scholar who has been away for three
days must be looked at with new eyes.

211
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,440
Get straight to the point.

212
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,359
Say, did you buy this house

213
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
after you returned to the country?

214
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm sure it costs a lot, right?

215
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
My company rented it for me.

216
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,239
If there's nothing else,

217
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,359
you should return first.

218
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,679
I still have some work to do.

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,440
Calm down.

220
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,840
Let's talk about what happened
three years ago.

221
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,359
Xiaoqi,

222
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,359
there's a new movie showing.

223
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,400
It's a romance movie.

224
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,479
Its rating is not bad.

225
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,880
If you're interested,

226
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll pick you up after work.

227
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,960
Brother Mo,

228
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,359
I planned to go to the Arts Department
to find you just now.

229
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,080
Isn't this a coincidence?

230
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
You're actually here.

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,280
Do you need anything?

232
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,200
It's like this.

233
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,799
Our department

234
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,559
has been waiting

235
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,799
for your department's first rendering.

236
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
I've reminded them several times.

237
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,840
All of them ignored me.

238
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,280
That's why, Brother Mo,
I'd like you to pass my message to them.

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
Are we familiar with each other?

240
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,080
No.

241
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:37,719
I was thinking

242
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
that you might do it
on account of Xiaoqi.

243
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
So, are you saying

244
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,559
that you're courting her?

245
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,599
Indeed, she's my ideal type.

246
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Are you a local?

247
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,400
No.

248
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
But my house isn't that far away.

249
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,599
It only takes two hours by car.

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,359
By car?

251
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,719
Do you have a car and a house?

252
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,359
No.

253
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,760
I heard

254
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,840
that you were almost sacked
because of a streamer before this.

255
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,840
It's like this.

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,640
Let me explain it to you.

257
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,400
That's enough.

258
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,840
Xiaoqi

259
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,039
is the only daughter of her family.

260
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,239
She's the apple of her parent's eyes.

261
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,599
After she graduated from university,

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,960
her parents bought her a house.

263
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,320
So, if you do become her boyfriend,

264
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
are you planning to stay at her house?

265
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,559
No.

266
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,159
I will buy them eventually.

267
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
You aren't good enough for her.

268
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
Just give up.

269
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,440
Brother Mo.

270
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,000
By the way,

271
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
I forgot to tell you something.

272
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,039
Xiaoqi and I aren't related by blood.

273
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,200
You mean...

274
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,159
What I mean is

275
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,359
I'm not her brother.

276
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,679
Don't refer to me as your brother.

277
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,719
In the future, call me Director Gu
when you're in the company.

278
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
So, you and her...

279
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,039
What does he mean by that?

280
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,840
(Sure.)

281
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
(What time?)

282
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,080
(Sorry.)

283
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,479
(I have something urgent
to attend to this afternoon.)

284
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,080
Da Huang,

285
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,640
did you get the rendering from them?

286
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,440
No.

287
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,799
They've delayed it
for one entire day, you know?

288
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,359
What did the Arts Department say?

289
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,640
I didn't go to the Arts Department.

290
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,359
I forgot about it as I was
busy with something else.

291
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,000
Da Huang,

292
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,880
can you be more serious at work?

293
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,159
We have a deadline, you know?

294
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,320
I know.

295
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,599
But the Arts Department
is delaying it, not us.

296
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,400
Even if we can't finish
our task on time, it's on them.

297
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,840
You!

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,559
Brother Lei.

299
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,039
Calm down.

300
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,919
Worse comes to worst,

301
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
we can delay the deadline by one day.

302
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,679
We must never delay our work!

303
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,520
Da Huang,

304
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,840
with this kind of work attitude,

305
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,799
you'll make a slip-up.

306
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
The company will still sack you,
you know?

307
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,599
Brother Lei.

308
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,200
I think that's too much.

309
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,359
Do you think I did it on purpose?

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,960
Brother Lei.

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,359
Don't do this.

312
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:05,799
Da Huang.

313
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's stop arguing, all right?

314
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,919
(Gu Mo sent you an offline document)
Let's stop arguing, all right?

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,440
Let's stop.

316
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,000
I've received their rendering.

317
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Wait.

318
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,559
I was always responsible for that part.

319
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,599
Why did they send it to you?

320
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:16,599
Da Huang,

321
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,479
did you offend someone
from the Arts Department?

322
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,880
Is that why they tried to
make things difficult for you?

323
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,400
Who sent it to you?

324
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,760
Director Gu.

325
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,080
It's fine as long as you receive
the necessary materials.

326
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,559
We're just doing it because of work.

327
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,799
Brother Lei,

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,320
you should stop working overtime
for the next few days.

329
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,359
Go back and rest early.

330
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,520
No way.

331
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,119
You see,

332
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,479
I have plenty of work to do.

333
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
Just leave the rest to me.

334
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,359
I'm responsible

335
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,479
for what the Arts Department did.

336
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,400
Hey,

337
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,479
what has that got to do with you?

338
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,080
Old Ape,

339
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,840
you don't understand.

340
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,400
Da Huang,

341
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,359
I was too impulsive just now.

342
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,599
I don't know what got into me.

343
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:50,799
Brother Lei,

344
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,479
I understand your personality.

345
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,479
You have OCD.

346
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,799
You must finish your work
within the allocated time.

347
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,119
This isn't your fault.

348
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,679
I bought two movie tickets.

349
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,679
You can find someone
to catch the movie with you.

350
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,840
If not, they'll go to waste.

351
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,679
Fine.

352
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,799
I have nothing to do
when I return home anyway.

353
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,080
Shutian,

354
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,039
join me.

355
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,400
I can't make it tonight.

356
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,479
I have to play video games
with my friends.

357
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,599
Just go.

358
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,320
I can't make it.

359
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,760
Why don't you let me join you?

360
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,400
That's great.

361
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Both of you should catch a movie

362
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,520
and have a change of mood.

363
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,440
Maybe, it will increase
our work efficiency.

364
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,359
Later, I'll send the ticket code to you.

365
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,719
All right.

366
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,239
Relax.

367
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,119
Catch a movie.

368
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,119
That's great.

369
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,380
(Shutting down)

370
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,559
Brother.

371
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,440
Where's sister-in-law?

372
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,000
She's in the office.

373
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,599
I just went to
the Programming Department.

374
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,159
I didn't see her.

375
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,840
Where did she go?

376
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,640
Do I look like her guardian to you?

377
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,719
How would I know where she is?

378
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Did you two have an argument?

379
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,679
Did she get off work
without telling you?

380
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,239
It's my fault.

381
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,599
I gave you too little work.

382
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,000
That's why you have time
to worry about my marriage.

383
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,719
It's hard for me
not to worry about your marriage.

384
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
Now, everyone in the company knows about

385
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,400
your romantic kiss with your
Sister-in-law yesterday.

386
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,280
Did you tell Mum?

387
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,880
Do you mean Li Man's return?

388
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,359
Of course not.

389
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,159
If not, Mum would've
visited you last night.

390
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,919
How do you plan to thank me?

391
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,640
You'll get this month's wage as usual.

392
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,799
That's all?

393
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:38,520
Young lady,

394
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,280
with the number of times
you've been late and skipped work,

395
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,119
you should be glad that
I didn't sack you

396
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,000
only because

397
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,400
you share the same parents with me.

398
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,280
What a petty guy.

399
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,559
Mum wanted me to tell you guys

400
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,039
to have a meal together with her.

401
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,520
So, you don't know
where Sister-in-law went?

402
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,960
So, did you tell her about Li Man?

403
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:57,760
Please handle your relationship

404
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
with Chen Yiming

405
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,080
before you meddle with my affair.

406
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,679
He was under my control long ago.

407
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,359
It's just that I haven't got the time
to haul in the net.

408
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,359
Listen,

409
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,679
if you don't cut your ties with Li Man,

410
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,559
Sister-in-law might hate you one day

411
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,559
and cheat on you to seek revenge.

412
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,200
Listen,

413
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,719
if you bother me again
during work hours,

414
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll sack you immediately.

415
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,080
You're so emotionally unstable
after your marriage.

416
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,719
I suggest you to see a psychiatrist.

417
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,159
And work hours are over.

418
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,760
Excuse me, please let me enter.

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,320
All right.

420
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,039
Lu.

421
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,880
It's starting.

422
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,599
All right.

423
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,840
Have some popcorn.

424
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:35,799
Thanks.

425
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,599
Brother Lei,

426
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,520
are you alright?

427
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,319
I'm fine.

428
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,400
Excuse me.

429
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,359
Brother Lei, what's wrong?

430
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,719
Just now, when I heard the loud noise,

431
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,520
my heart was beating rapidly.

432
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,119
And I felt

433
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,359
that it was difficult

434
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,640
for me to breathe.

435
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,680
Look at your face.

436
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,280
Why do you look so pale?

437
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,439
Can you move?

438
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:58,239
I can.

439
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,400
Let me send you to the hospital.

440
00:17:59,479 --> 00:17:59,680
Let's go.

441
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,640
The hospital?

442
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,520
She's not home at this hour?

443
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,000
This married woman
has no self-awareness at all.

444
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Listen,

445
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,000
if you don't cut your ties with Li Man,

446
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
Sister-in-law might hate you one day

447
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,839
and cheat on you to seek revenge.

448
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,239
It's no wonder
you didn't send me a message.

449
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,660
(Off the blacklist)

450
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
You're not replying to my message?

451
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740

456
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,520
What is it?

457
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:45,599
Hey,

458
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
send me a random message on WeChat.

459
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
What message.

460
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,040
Any message.

461
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,040
Don't hang up on me.

462
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,239
I sent it to you.

463
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,760
But it showed that
my message was rejected.

464
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
(Jiang Zitong)

465
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
(Off the blacklist)

466
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,920
It's working now.

467
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,760
Did you block me?

468
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,280
This...

469
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,719
What is he doing

470
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,880
in the middle of the night?

471
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,180

(Add to blacklist)

474
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,000
Since you're not looking for me,

475
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,959
you can enjoy yourself
after I block you!

476
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,760
How is it?

477
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:37,719
I'm fine.

478
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:38,553
(Emergency Department)

479
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,479
There's nothing wrong with my blood test
and electrocardiogram.

480
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,359
There's nothing wrong with my
ultrasonic cardiogram as well.

481
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,479
Maybe it has nothing to do
with your heart?

482
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,040
Maybe it has something to do
with your other organs?

483
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,319
The doctor checked
my thyroid gland as well.

484
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,160
It's fine.

485
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm glad that you're fine.

486
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,760
You should go back and sleep well.

487
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,319
All right.

488
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,280
It's quite late.

489
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,640
Let's go.

490
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,439
Let me send you back.

491
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:00,880
No need for that.

492
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,719
I can take a cab.

493
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,079
Don't do so.

494
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,719
If you do this, I'll feel guilty
and I won't be able to sleep.

495
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,839
Come on, let me send you back.

496
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:07,959
Sure.

497
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,640
It's 11 PM.

498
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,119
Is she not home yet?

499
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,280
Don't tell me something happened to her?

500
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,079
Lu,

501
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,800
it's all thanks to you.

502
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:01,920
Thank you for accompanying me.

503
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,239
Why are you so courteous?

504
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,359
Brother Lei,

505
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,560
you shouldn't work overtime
during the weekend.

506
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,439
Rest well.

507
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,079
I can't rest

508
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,359
when I haven't finished my work.

509
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,119
It's fine.

510
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,760
The doctor said I'm fine, right?

511
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,280
Drive safely, all right?

512
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,040
Goodbye.

513
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:16,760
See you next week.

514
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,119
I'm back.

515
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,280
I bought some fried chickens for you.

516
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,400
Look at what time it is.

517
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,199
Where did you go?

518
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,599
I had something to attend to.

519
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,319
It's not safe for a girl to be out
at this late hour.

520
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,479
Don't you know that?

521
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,920
Are you worried about me?

522
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,239
Why should I be worried about you?

523
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:36,439
I...

524
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,680
According to the cohabitation rules,

525
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
it states that no one is allowed to
make noise after 11 PM.

526
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,400
Now, it's 11:40 PM.

527
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,239
But you're still awake.

528
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,719
You have to brush your teeth

529
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,319
and change your clothes
when you come back.

530
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
How could I sleep

531
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,760
with all that noise?

532
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,760
Sorry about that.

533
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,400
Something did pop up today.

534
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,079
I'll take note of it next time.

535
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,959
Were you watching Peppa Pig?

536
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,680
What did you say just now?

537
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,280
So, what happened today?

538
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,839
We went to catch a movie.

539
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,520
After that, Lei...

540
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,199
So, you returned late
because you went to catch a movie?

541
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,040
You really impress me.

542
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,040
By the way,

543
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,000
finish the fried chickens.

544
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,800
He's ridiculous.

545
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,439
Do you want some milk?

546
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,719
Sorry.

547
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
I did interrupt your sleep last night.

548
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,560
Lu Li,

549
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,359
count the times

550
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,199
you had apologised to me.

551
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,359
Have you ever thought of
why you always apologised to me?

552
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,199
It's because you always get mad at me.

553
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:12,920
No.

554
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,359
It's because you always commit mistakes.

555
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,640
At least I apologise for my mistakes.

556
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,959
Someone only knows how to make excuses
when he makes mistakes.

557
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,599
Are you saying that I'm making excuses?

558
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,520
Explain yourself.

559
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Do you know how old you are?

560
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,680
Did you actually get milk on your lips?

561
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,719
Mum,

562
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,079
I'm not working today.

563
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,920
All right.

564
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,040
What is it?

565
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,239
Your mother wants me
to join her for a gathering.

566
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,680
Do you want to join us?

567
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,239
Why should I go

568
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,479
when it's a women's gathering?

569
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,640
Fine.

570
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
Send me the address.

571
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,839
I'll pick you up after the gathering.

572
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:53,920
Really?

573
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
I just don't want my mother
to nag at me.

574
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,079
It'll be better if you make this shorter.

575
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,040
Look, this flower is nice.

576
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,319
Li,

577
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,000
come.

578
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:15,800
Mum.

579
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
You're late.

580
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,400
I just arrived.

581
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,000
Yueru,

582
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,920
is she Yicheng's wife?

583
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,959
Hello, madams.

584
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,479
Hello.

585
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,839
I thought Yicheng was going on
blind dates before this?

586
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,680
He actually got married
in such a short time?

587
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

588
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,680
He didn't fancy any
of his blind date partners.

589
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,400
But when he saw Li,

590
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,719
he fell in love with her at first sight.

591
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,760
So,

592
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,800
we can never escape from
the magic of destiny.

593
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:40,920
Indeed.

594
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,959
Is your name Li?

595
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,400
So, what do you do for a living?

596
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:44,719
I'm a programmer.

597
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,040
A female programmer is rare indeed.

598
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,800
So, which family did you come from?

599
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,239
My parents are just ordinary employees.

600
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,640
I don't think you guys
have heard of them.

601
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,959
I thought Jiang Yicheng
had exceptional taste.

602
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,479
Seems like I was wrong.

603
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,040
Miss, you are?

604
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,920
I was one of your son's
blind date partners.

605
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,119
She doesn't know how to dress
herself up, has no courtesy,

606
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,199
and she dresses herself up
like a tomboy.

607
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,760
Jiang Yicheng does have
peculiar taste indeed.

608
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,640
So, he likes lowly women like you?

609
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,479
I admit, you're better
at being lowly than me.

610
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,520
You're mistaken.

611
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
How am I mistaken?

612
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,520
So what if you're better than her?

613
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,880
In my eyes, she's better than you
in everything.

614
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,800
That's why I rejected you

615
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,400
and married her.

616
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,920
I have a great beauty sense.

617
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,760
And my taste is exceptionally high.

618
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,719
Why didn't you stand up for yourself?

619
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,719
I haven't got the chance to do so.

620
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,000
Dumb koala.

621
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,880
My son, why are you here?

622
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
I need to speak with her.

623
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,680
I'll bring her with me first.

624
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,800
All right.

625
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,359
Go now.

626
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,160
Goodbye, Mum.

627
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,880
Goodbye, madams.

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,239
Okay.

629
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,000
Goodbye.

630
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,560
Look at how loving they are.

631
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,119
They stick with each other all the time.

632
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,680
You're so fortunate.

633
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,239
Come.

634
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,760
Let's continue.

635
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,680
Let's continue.

636
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,400
So, what's the matter?

637
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,800
I want to watch a movie,

638
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,119
but I don't want to watch it alone.

639
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,920
But I just watched one movie last night.

640
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,319
I meant,

641
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,280
yesterday's movie sucked.

642
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,760
We can watch another movie.

643
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,199
You can pick the movie then.

644
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Thank you for helping me out.

645
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,959
No one

646
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,560
can bully my woman.

647
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,119
What I meant was

648
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm the only one who can bully my woman.

649
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,000
Sure, I'll only let you
bully me from now on.

650
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Morning, Brother Lei.

651
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,359
Morning.

652
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,599
Are you okay now?

653
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,280
Yeah.

654
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,000
Morning.

655
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,920
Da Huang,

656
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,239
did you work overtime
during the weekend as well?

657
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,359
I'm channeling my sorrow into energy.

658
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,119
Was that movie great?

659
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,319
It was meant for a couple.

660
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,000
So, you bought two tickets because...

661
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,239
Enough already.

662
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,760
I feel sad when you remind me of it.

663
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,359
It would be great if getting a
girlfriend is as easy as writing codes.

664
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,680
Everyone,

665
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,160
check the message in the group.

666
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,560
Calling for creative ideas?

667
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,199
Our company is calling for

668
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,479
creative individual or group ideas
from all of our employees.

669
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
The best idea that was chosen
will be developed into a game?

670
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,199
By the way,

671
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,719
once an idea has been chosen,

672
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,839
the one who came up with the idea

673
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,439
will be able to join

674
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
the new game's development team
immediately.

675
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,359
And he or she will be able to get
the main position

676
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,280
related to his or
her current professionalism.

677
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,079
I thought this was the job
of the Planning Department?

678
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,920
And our current games

679
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,479
are doing well.

680
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,479
The users always seek
something new and fresh.

681
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,719
Just like why you would watch a movie.

682
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,239
Will you watch the same movie
again and again?

683
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,040
Why don't we develop
an oasis simulation game

684
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
like Ready Player One?

685
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm sure it'll explode in popularity.

686
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:44,640
Da Huang,

687
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,839
when you try to be creative,

688
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,560
you need to base your creativity
on the current technology we have.

689
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,599
And if you have any great ideas,

690
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,880
you can download

691
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,400
the creative game form from the group.

692
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,800
Or you can tell Mr. Chen
about your idea directly.

693
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,359
Once your idea has been accepted,

694
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,959
the company will reward you.

695
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
I couldn't care less about that.

696
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:01,400
But Old Ape,

697
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,719
this isn't compulsory, right?

698
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,599
This is a voluntary activity.

699
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
If you want the company to
rate your performance highly,

700
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,800
they may add bonus marks

701
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,599
to your year-end assessment
once you join this activity.

702
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,520
Bonus marks.

703
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,359
Wait.

704
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,920
Aren't they forcing us
to be creative right now?

705
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,800
We can't even finish our current work.

706
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,680
Now, do we need to do the work
of the Planning Department?

707
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,520
Isn't this

708
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,959
too stressful?

709
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,319
What's wrong with Brother Lei?

710
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,520
Let me check on him.

711
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,560
Brother Lei,

712
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
are you okay?

713
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm fine.

714
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,760
It's just

715
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,280
that I'm experiencing the
same palpitation, just like last time.

716
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,920
Say, is this myocardial infarction?

717
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,839
No way.

718
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:01,839
Calm down for now.

719
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,319
Relax.

720
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,839
You went for a heart check-up before.

721
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,400
Did you forget?

722
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:07,719
You're right.

723
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,719
Brother Lei,

724
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,319
since when did these symptoms
start appearing?

725
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,439
I think it's after Mr. Jiang
said he wanted to sack Da Huang.

726
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,319
Since then,

727
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,400
I have been afraid of committing
the same mistake.

728
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:21,680
That's why I need to re-check
my codes numerous times

729
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,959
before I hand them to him.

730
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,160
But the more I do so,

731
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,760
the more I'll be reminded of
that incident.

732
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:27,920
When I think about it,

733
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,800
it's as if my brain is going to explode.

734
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,119
But that incident has been resolved.

735
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,599
You shouldn't
pressure yourself with that.

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,319
Yeah.

737
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:37,400
But

738
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
I can't control my emotions.

739
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,199
Just like last night,

740
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,719
I couldn't sleep even though
I was lying on the bed.

741
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,959
I was reminded of the time

742
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,400
when I was bitten by a dog
as a young kid.

743
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,199
When I thought about that,

744
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,719
I was afraid that I would get rabies.

745
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,479
I couldn't sleep a wink at all.

746
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,439
And when I heard a little noise,

747
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,160
I felt like

748
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,760
if I was shocked.

749
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,599
My limbs started to go numb.

750
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,319
After that, I felt as if

751
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,400
there was a huge rock on my chest.

752
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,599
I couldn't breathe.

753
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,640
I don't know what's wrong with me.

754
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,800
But if this continues,

755
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
my system will collapse.

756
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:06,719
Brother Lei,

757
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,600
your hardware is fine.

758
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,679
Did something happen to your software?

759
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,719
Are you saying that I...

760
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,199
Let's go.

761
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,639
I'll accompany you
to the hospital again.

762
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:17,959
Let's do a full body check-up.

763
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,560
But it's working hours now.

764
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,800
Your health is more important.

765
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,239
I'll apply for leave from Old Ape.

766
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:23,800
Let's go.

767
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,080
If it weren't for you,

768
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,040
I wouldn't know that there's something
wrong with my software.

769
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,360
Thank you.

770
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,439
It's because you reminded me
of something.

771
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,840
Usually, when a system collapses,

772
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
it's due to the software's malfunction.

773
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,480
(Consulting Room)

774
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,199
In the past,

775
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
I always thought that
I was a strong person.

776
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,719
When I saw people

777
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
who were mentally ill on the Internet,

778
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,080
I even teased them.

779
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,320
I didn't expect

780
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,959
myself to be one of them now.

781
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,000
Didn't you hear the doctor just now?

782
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,000
Now, everyone is under
tremendous work pressure.

783
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,159
We should focus more on
our mental health.

784
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:55,840
You're right.

785
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,439
If you feel troubled,

786
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,719
you should communicate more with us.

787
00:34:58,879 --> 00:34:59,719
We can have a chat

788
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,360
and release some stress.

789
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,120
All right.

790
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,239
You're right.

791
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,399
Even if I get off work on time,

792
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,639
I'll watch TV shows

793
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,479
or play games.

794
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,040
I was isolating myself too much.

795
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,399
Isolation?

796
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,439
Isolation.

797
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:20,800
Lu.

798
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,560
Lu?

799
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:25,719
Brother Lei,

800
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,320
why don't you return home today?

801
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,560
You should stop working.

802
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,239
It's fine.

803
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,520
I've found the cause of my illness.

804
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,679
I feel much better.

805
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
I'll go back and finish today's work.

806
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,040
I won't work overtime tomorrow
no matter what.

807
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,320
Let's go.

808
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,239
Let's go.

809
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,360
(Even if I get off work on time,)

810
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,479
(I'll watch TV shows or play games.)

811
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,040
(I was isolating myself too much.)

812
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,180
(Stress, isolation)

813
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,220
(Stress, isolation, anxiety)

814
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,719
(We always fight
our battles by ourselves.)

815
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:27,040
(Loneliness and flaws
are battling each other out.)

816
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,020
(Stress, isolation, anxiety, loneliness)

817
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,639
I've done some researches today.

818
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:47,959
According to an investigation,

819
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,959
in our country, there are nearly
200 million people who are single.

820
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,760
There are more than 77 million people
who live alone.

821
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Although these people enjoy
the feeling of staying at home,

822
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,879
61.74% of them

823
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,000
do experience loneliness.

824
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Now, there's a term
called empty-nest youths.

825
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,399
It refers to youngsters
who left their families

826
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,199
to work in a big city.

827
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:07,560
They eat,

828
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:08,919
watch a movie, and play games alone.

829
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,399
Just like our current lives.

830
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,679
They lack companionship and affection.

831
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,479
There's no suitable way
for them to make friends.

832
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,280
They have no choice but to feel lonely.

833
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,280
That's right.

834
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,760
Under such circumstances,

835
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,719
most people will feel lonely,

836
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,000
anxious, and inferior.

837
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,439
They're unable to express
their pent-up emotions.

838
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Over time,

839
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,840
their mental health

840
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,159
will be greatly affected.

841
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,639
That's why, I was thinking

842
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,000
that if there's a game

843
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,520
that can provide solutions
for social isolation,

844
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,760
helping the users

845
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,879
be friends outside of the game,

846
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,040
it would be great.

847
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,159
Yicheng,

848
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,120
what do you think about this idea?

849
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,199
It's not a bad idea.

850
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
But how do we

851
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,479
break the barrier
between the online and offline world?

852
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,320
That is the question to ask.

853
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,000
I have some preliminary ideas,

854
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,080
but I haven't completed them yet.

855
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,879
Complete them

856
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
and hand in

857
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,159
the completed proposal to me.

858
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,639
I thought this was a voluntary activity?

859
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,879
What?

860
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,959
Are you planning to give up?

861
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,199
No.

862
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,439
I just think that I should
leave the proposal

863
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,600
to the pros in the Planning Department.

864
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,679
I'm afraid I'll do a bad job.

865
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:15,639
It's fine.

866
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,360
Since the company is
targeting all employees,

867
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,800
that means the professionalism of
the proposal isn't our main focus.

868
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,879
We focus on unique and creative ideas
for the core mechanics.

869
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,840
An exceptional programmer

870
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,439
must be good at inventing a product
and planning its development.

871
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,320
Moreover,

872
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,320
I thought your nickname

873
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,120
was Miss Solve-It-All?

874
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:41,959
Fine then.

875
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,800
I'll do it.

876
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,439
But I have one condition.

877
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,080
What is it?

878
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
If the company

879
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,600
does choose my idea,

880
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,080
I hope I can be
the main programmer of the game.

881
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,959
The more wit, the less courage.
Seems like you're witless.

882
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,959
Do you wish to ascend to the top
even though you just graduated?

883
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,199
Do you know

884
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,919
how much experience you need to have

885
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
and how many responsibilities
you need to bear

886
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,360
to be the main programmer of a game?

887
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,479
I know that.

888
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,199
That's why I want to challenge myself.

889
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,959
I want to give it a try.

890
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,479
If I'm doing a bad job,

891
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,959
you can swap me
for someone else at any time.

892
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:09,800
Fine.

893
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,239
Let us wait and see then.

894
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:21,919
Miss Li.

895
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,600
It must've been tough on you.

896
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,959
Don't mention it.

897
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,120
Miss Man,

898
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,919
even if you're busy with work,
you can't just skip your meals.

899
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,439
Do I need to hire a housekeeper for you

900
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
and ask them to cook
three meals for you per day?

901
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,399
No need for that.

902
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,120
Amy,

903
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,679
book a return flight
the day after tomorrow for me.

904
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,120
Did the HQ ask you to attend a meeting?

905
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:52,800
No.

906
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,360
Terminate the rent contact
of this house.

907
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,199
So, are we ignoring this place?

908
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,919
But our observation period
of Enchant isn't over yet.

909
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
I've handed everything to Mr. Liu.

910
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,919
I believe that he can deal with them.

911
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,760
What's wrong?

912
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,600
Miss Man,

913
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,360
you came back because of Jiang Yicheng.

914
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,560
You knew that, right?

915
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,159
I forgot to tell you something.

916
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,639
He's already married.

917
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,439
He's married?

918
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,760
With that female programmer?

919
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,439
How is that possible?

920
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,080
Yes.

921
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I was surprised as well.

922
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:34,959
But he admitted it personally.

923
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,000
Don't tell me he's deceiving you?

924
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,320
According to my understanding of him,

925
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,120
he will never joke with me
when it comes to this kind of matters.

926
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,520
But you've spent so much effort
to get to this position

927
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,800
and return to the country.

928
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,840
I'm sure you know that the best.

929
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
Are you giving up already?

930
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:57,800
Yes.

931
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,719
To be able to stand beside him,

932
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,159
I've been working

933
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,719
non-stop for the past three years.

934
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,600
You know,

935
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,239
I didn't apply for leave
even if I was sick.

936
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,639
All of them thought I was a workaholic.

937
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,560
They thought I had infinite energy.

938
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,159
But Yicheng

939
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,199
is the sole reason I'm doing this.

940
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,959
So now,

941
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,760
I don't know what to do either.

942
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:27,399
The silliest thing is

943
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,679
that I thought he stayed single
for three years

944
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,439
because he was waiting for me.

945
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,159
I thought he wasn't hiring
any female programmers

946
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,919
because he couldn't let go of me.

947
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,600
In the end, I realised

948
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,479
that everything I came up with

949
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,399
was only my wishful thinking.

950
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,199
Miss Man,

951
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,520
I think something's wrong.

952
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,959
Think about it.

953
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,399
The last time,

954
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,760
when we saw Jiang Yicheng got together
with the female programmer,

955
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,959
their employees were surprised as well.

956
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
I think

957
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,879
they didn't know that
they were a couple.

958
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,959
Yes.

959
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,120
No one stated that employees couldn't
be in a relationship with each other.

960
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,520
So, why did they hide their marriage
from everyone else?

961
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,600
Yicheng isn't someone
who will hide secrets.

962
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,760
So, that's why I think
something's wrong.

963
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,199
You told me

964
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,639
that they barely knew each other.

965
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,280
So, why did they get married
all of a sudden?

966
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,840
You do have a point.

967
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,239
I will try to verify this.

968
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,879
Lu!

969
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:15,239
I finally know
what's the cause of my problems.

970
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,600
I feel much better now.

971
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,080
Now, you just need to debug.

972
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:20,479
This is your specialty, you know?

973
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,639
It's all thanks to you.

974
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,199
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

975
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:25,399
You mustn't reject me, okay?

976
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,000
Can I choose the dishes?

977
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,840
That's a given.

978
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,760
Let's go.

979
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,560
Lu Li.

980
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,560
Mr. Jiang?

981
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,719
I thought you left work early?

982
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,879
Why are you still here?

983
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,040
Did you forget something?

984
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,719
Do you have a date with Mr. Jiang?

985
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:47,239
No.

986
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,120
Your Remembrall

987
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,199
is glowing red.

988
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,520
I don't remember being busy today.

989
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,080
Did you forget your next important task?

990
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,239
We don't have much time.

991
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:58,360
You need to cherish every second.

992
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
I didn't forget about that.

993
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,719
I will cherish my time.

994
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,239
Cherish your time so that
you can go and have your meal?

995
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,879
Lu,

996
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,320
why don't we postpone our meal?

997
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,120
Mr. Jiang,

998
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,479
see you.

999
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,360
Brother Lei.

1000
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:14,439
Is this your car?

1001
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,840
Yeah, what's wrong?

1002
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,399
Seems like you two
are quite close lately.

1003
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:20,600
Mr. Jiang,

1004
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,040
please don't misunderstand us.

1005
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,919
I've been feeling uncomfortable lately.

1006
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,199
Lu accompanied me to the hospital

1007
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:27,800
as my colleague.

1008
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,239
Are you sick?

1009
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,520
Something's wrong with my software.

1010
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,280
I'll be fine

1011
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,080
after I readjust
and reinstall the system.

1012
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:36,600
You should return and rest early then.

1013
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:37,520
All right. Mr. Jiang,

1014
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:38,320
don't worry.

1015
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:39,840
I won't let my health affect my work.

1016
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:40,760
All right.

1017
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,080
Please go ahead.

1018
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:01,120
So, did you watch a movie
together with Brother Lei?

1019
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,840
Da Huang bought two extra tickets.

1020
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,879
It'll be a waste if we don't use them.

1021
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,520
After that, Brother Lei
felt uncomfortable.

1022
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,959
I sent him to the hospital.

1023
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,159
That's why I returned home
at a late hour.

1024
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:10,679
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1025
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,080
You didn't give me a chance to speak.

1026
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:12,639
You!

1027
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,520
Who told you to ramble?

1028
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,280
Anyway,

1029
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,199
if you did the same for your proposal,

1030
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,719
I might ask you
to redo the entire thing.

1031
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,479
Understood.

1032
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:23,800
Get in the car.

1033
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,600
(There are bugs)

1034
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,040
(in every relationship.)

1035
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:50,800
(Instead of defending against
the hackers from hacking your system,)

1036
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,120
(it's better for you
to restore the system)

1037
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:55,280
(and take the initiative
for your relationship.)
