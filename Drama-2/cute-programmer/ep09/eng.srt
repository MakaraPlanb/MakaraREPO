21
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,119
It is 7.30 PM.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't tell me she is still working.

23
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,839
Lu... Lu Li.

24
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm curious about something.

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,199
How did you convince Mr. Jiang

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,039
to let you stay?

27
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,039
That's right.

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,479
Mr. Jiang is usually
a very principled man.

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,119
It is not likely that he will
change the policy, right?

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
That is right.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,960
Well,

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,399
my mum and Mr. Jiang's mum
were high school classmates.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
So...

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,440
So this is how you're related?

35
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,759
Why did you dress up like a man
when you have this connection?

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,240
Exactly.

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,639
That is right.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
I did not know before this.

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,160
Drink one glass as punishment.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,720
You must drink as punishment.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Do you know

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,559
all of us were worried
all week because of this matter?

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,000
He is right.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,479
Especially how high
my internal body heat is.

45
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,479
Look at my mouth ulcer.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,559
Look at the sty
at the corner of my eye too.

47
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,160
Everyone, raise your glasses.

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,360
Let's drink.

49
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,679
Lu Li is a girl
so don't make her drink beer.

50
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,839
Look at that,

51
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,839
Mr. Chen is considerate to a girl.

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,199
A man taking care of a girl

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,479
is also a gentleman's behavior.

54
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's drink.

55
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,160
Yiming,

56
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,639
why do I like listening to you best?

57
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
Everything you sum up

58
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
is brilliant.

59
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:55,720
Da Huang.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,039
What about me?

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
You should learn more from him.

62
00:03:59,399 --> 00:03:59,960
Learn what?

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,160
Otherwise, why would you...
No wonder you have no girlfriend.

64
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,080
What do you even know?

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
Come, look.

66
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,559
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,360
Look at

68
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,800
how Da Huang not doing anything else

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
other than
sending text messages all night.

70
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,440
Is something going on?

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,000
There is...

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,440
There is something.

73
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,959
Spring is here again.

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Since you asked, I
will just announce it.

75
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,880
Come on, tell us.

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,839
I am sorry, my brothers.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
From now on

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,279
I'm no longer

79
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,959
a man without a prospect.

80
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,359
Judging from the time and
frequency of working overtime,

81
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,720
it must be online dating, right?

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,720
Not bad.

83
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,119
Am I right?

84
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,959
This girl

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,279
is a game streamer whom
I've been watching for a period of time.

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,519
I happened

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,440
to run into her a few days ago.

88
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,119
Come on, wish me all the best.

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,679
Congratulations, Da Huang.

90
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,239
Would a game streamer like you?

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,640
What is up with you?

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,600
You are spoiling the conversation.

94
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,239
Don't you know programmers
like us are popular now?

95
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,959
Those who can chat, play,

96
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,959
programming and handle computers

97
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,200
are programmers.

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,440
Who are you ridiculing?

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,279
Da Huang is right about that.

100
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,239
Son, you were wrong.

101
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,119
You were wrong.

102
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,440
Let me continue talking to her.

103
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,440
She will get anxious
if I do not reply to her.

104
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
Let's drink.

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
(Today's barbecue was really great.)

106
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,760
You said you are going
to have dinner with me.

107
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:27,880
What a liar!

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,679
Careful.

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
I will go back first.

110
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,399
I am leaving now.

111
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,799
Goodbye!

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,200
Be careful, goodbye.

113
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,720
Careful on your way home.

114
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,079
We are leaving.

115
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,799
Goodbye.

116
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,480
Lu Li,

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,600
how are you going back?

118
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
I can take a taxi.

119
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,799
Okay.

120
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,559
I will send her home.

121
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,679
In that case, I will go home now.

122
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,079
Okay.

123
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,720
Goodbye.

124
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,040
Goodbye.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Be careful on your way back.

126
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,519
Goodbye.

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,559
Mr. Chen, I said it is my treat.

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,920
Why did you pay the bill?

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,839
Then you have to
prepare breakfast well.

130
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,200
(Get me fried chicken
when you come back.)

131
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,399
Let's go, I have called
a designated driver.

132
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,359
I need to buy something.
Why don't you go first?

133
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,239
It does not matter what you are buying,

134
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,600
I already promised to send you home.

135
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,440
Let's go.

136
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,180
(Okay.)

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,720
"Okay"?

138
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,679
You did not even ask what flavor I wanted.

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
Or if I want a whole or half a chicken.

140
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Mum.

141
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,519
Son,

142
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,559
have you eaten?

143
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes.

144
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,720
(What did you eat?)

145
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
What do you want?

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,519
Where's Li?

147
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,160
I want to see my dear daughter-in-law.

148
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,399
She went out for dinner
with her colleagues.

149
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,200
Why didn't you go?

150
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,119
I...

151
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,119
I'm the boss.

152
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,559
They wouldn't feel
comfortable if I went.

153
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,480
You're right about that.

154
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,839
When are you going to pick her up?

155
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,920
I am not, she will take the taxi.

156
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,079
What is wrong with you?

157
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,279
It is already so late, a girl

158
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,239
would feel scared alone.

159
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,320
Why don't you go pick her up?

160
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,200
No.

161
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,040
Darling,

162
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,279
accompany me to pick up Li.

163
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,679
I will go. Do not call for my dad.

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,559
That is more like it. Go now, okay?

165
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,640
For my mother's sake,
I will go pick you up.

166
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I am at the parking lot now.

167
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Where are you?

168
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,040
Mr. Chen,

169
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,079
you really don't have to send me.

170
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,959
I can take the taxi home.

171
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,160
To let a girl going home alone
late at night

172
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,519
is not my way of doing things.

173
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,920
Since all of you complimented me
being a gentleman,

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,119
I should do my part then.

175
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go.

176
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,320
Yiming!

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Yicheng, what are you doing here?

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,760
I can ask you the same thing.

179
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,279
We had dinner just now.

180
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,839
So I accompany Lu Li
to buy something here.

181
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,880
Mr. Chen is really
thoughtful of his subordinate.

182
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,320
Have you forgotten?

183
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,839
She is both my direct subordinate
and my fan too.

184
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,359
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Chen,
enjoy your conversation.

185
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,399
I will take my leave first.

186
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,520
Since your house
happens to be on the way,

187
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,559
I will give you a ride.

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
We will take our leave first.

189
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,080
Mr. Chen, see you.

190
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,960
Didn't you read my reply on WeChat?

191
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:57,919
I did.

192
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,760
Then why did you come out
and buy yourself?

193
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you doing?

194
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,440
I want to eat fried chicken.

195
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,320
It is inconvenient for you since
you are driving. I will hold it for you.

196
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,559
Why don't you eat too?

197
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,359
I ate a lot during dinner just now.

198
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,919
Why did you buy so many
when you were full?

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Half of these are yours.

200
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,440
I am too full to eat.

201
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,679
Lu Li,

202
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
you bought these fried chickens.

203
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,320
It's not good to waste it.

204
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,280
I have finally finished it!

205
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,559
You have done well.

206
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,559
Is there anything else?

207
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,359
You have not cleaned the house today.

208
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,119
We went out together during the day.

209
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,359
Besides, the house is clean
so there is no need to clean every day.

210
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,000
Just say if you are trying to slack off.

211
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,320
I can understand you are
exhausted from the gathering.

212
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,679
Are you thirsty? I will make
you something to drink.

213
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,520
Wait for me, it will
be ready right away.

214
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:10,880
It is ready.

215
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,880
It is made from instant coffee.

216
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,719
Try it.

217
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,320
Banana flavor?

218
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,719
Yes,

219
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,440
I learned how to make a
banana latte from Mr. Chen.

220
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,039
I add a lot of milk in here.

221
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,599
I am scared it might
keep you awake at night

222
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,000
so I only add a small amount of coffee.

223
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,080
I do not like bananas, let alone lattes.

224
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,960
I do not want it.

225
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
It is really good.

226
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,039
You will know once you have tried it.

227
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:35,520
Here.

228
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,119
I am sorry.

229
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
Why are you apologizing?

230
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,599
I did not hold the glass properly.
I will clean this up.

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
It is already late. Clean it tomorrow.

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
If I do not clean it now,
it will leave a stain.

233
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,840
Up to you.

234
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,239
Hello,

235
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,640
I brought you pumpkin porridge.

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,880
It's low-fat and not fattening.

237
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,200
Xunxun,

238
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
why are you so sweet?

239
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,760
Shit?

240
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,119
It is sweet.

241
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,880
You are my girlfriend

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,719
so it is my job.

243
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,840
Come on in then.

244
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,400
Do you know

245
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,960
that game streamer

246
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
wants me to hold a PK
with her on the live stream.

247
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,359
She knew I couldn't defeat her.

248
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,599
She is doing it on purpose.

249
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,760
Just give any excuse

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,520
to delay it for two days.

251
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,599
I will train you for two days.
You will definitely win her.

252
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,080
The fans are waiting now.

253
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,719
If I do not accept her challenge,

254
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,479
others will think I am too scared

255
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,320
to compete with her.

256
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:27,719
Then...

257
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,039
What should we do then?

258
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,039
Xunxun,

259
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,679
I think...

260
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,760
Why don't you play for me?

261
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,719
It is not right to play for you.

262
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,520
Isn't this deceiving the public?

263
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,640
Xunxun,

264
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,080
just this once, okay?

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,039
Just this once.

266
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,559
Fine.

267
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,799
No problem, I will play for you

268
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,479
and win this for you.

269
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,400
Xunxun, you are the best.

270
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,400
It is good to have you here.

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I will have the things ready.

272
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,039
Mom,

273
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,880
what is it that you want

274
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,200
so early in the morning?

275
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,280
There's something important

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
I want you and Li to do today.

277
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,039
We are busy today.

278
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Anyway, I've sent the address to you.

279
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,159
If you don't show up,

280
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,599
I'll go straight to the office
to find you.

281
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,760
What are we doing here?

282
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,919
Aren't we going to the office?

283
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,359
No idea, mom wants us to be here.

284
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,159
Let's go.

285
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,559
I knew she was up to no good.

286
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,599
Just act accordingly later.

287
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,159
Mom.

288
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,799
Mom, I still have worked at the office.

289
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,200
Just tell us what you want.

290
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,159
I know you are busy.

291
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:40,000
Didn't I agree to delay
your wedding already?

292
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,359
But do not let it stop you
from taking your wedding photos.

293
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,239
I have already found the photographer.

294
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:45,799
Come here.

295
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,159
Help them get dressed.

296
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,039
Sir, this way please.

297
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,520
Please.

298
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,640
Miss, this way please.

299
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,679
Right this way.

300
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,679
This way, please.

301
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,679
How handsome.

302
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,199
This looks so beautiful.

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,000
This one.

304
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,959
Not bad, right?

305
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
Why are you so clumsy?

306
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,719
You can't even walk properly.

307
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,760
The heels are too high,
I am not used to them.

308
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,466
Why did you listen to them
and wear them?

309
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
How obedient.

310
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,479
The fabric of this dress is too thin.

311
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,640
Go change quickly.

312
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,959
Son!

313
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,400
The photos look perfect.

314
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,640
Why don't you take some more?

315
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,119
We need to go back to the office.

316
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,119
Fine,

317
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,719
the photographer and I

318
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,439
will go back to the
office with you then.

319
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,160
I won't go back then.

320
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,359
Get a laptop for me,
I will just work here.

321
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,959
This one.

322
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,839
It saddens me so much.

323
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,520
I am going to call your dad.

324
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,560
Mom, don't be anxious.

325
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,800
Jiang Yicheng may think

326
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,359
this style does not suit us.

327
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,359
What style is suitable then?

328
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,119
Stop taking my pictures.

329
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:37,839
You...

330
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,760
You're still doing it.

331
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
I look pretty handsome.

332
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,959
Come in.

333
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:40,800
Have you seen the photos
sent by the photographer?

334
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,920
What is there to see about those photos?

335
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,520
I know you do not
want to take photos.

336
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,119
But mom made so much preparation.

337
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,640
I just do not want to let her down.

338
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,719
So you dragged me along to take photos

339
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,680
just because you do not
want to let my mom down?

340
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,479
I am tired. I am going to bed.

341
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,000
The photographer wants
us to pick a few photos

342
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,079
for editing.

343
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,760
Aren't those just tools
to brush my mom off?

344
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,959
What is there to choose?

345
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,479
Choose a different one.

346
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,560
I thought you were going to bed.

347
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,119
You are making so much noise
choosing the photos.

348
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,760
Stop mumbling. Move aside.

349
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,199
I was not noisy at all.

350
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,959
I will choose it.

351
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,119
What kind of expression is this?

352
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,119
You brought down
the quality of my photo.

353
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,839
I think it looks pretty good.
It is not weird at all.

354
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,479
The interesting one is coming.

355
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,920
Why did you open your mouth so wide?

356
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,239
Look, just like that.

357
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,560
Putting it on the TV
like this can ward off evil.

358
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,479
You need to smile
for the wedding photos to look good.

359
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,560
Just go to bed, I will choose it myself.

360
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,239
What are you doing?

361
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,640
I am monitoring you.

362
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,359
What if you choose an ugly photo of me?

363
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,079
I cannot choose if you behave this way.

364
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,640
Let me go.

365
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,239
Look at this.

366
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,920
Zoom in.

367
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,160
Stop looking at me, you
have to look at yourself.

368
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,479
What is wrong with me?

369
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,239
Look how handsome I look.

370
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,359
This deep expression in my eyes.

371
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,760
Do you call that deep expression?

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,959
Who are you looking so fiercely at?

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,599
What kind of look is that?

374
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,359
Just take a look at yourself.

375
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,040
Look at your photos.

376
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
We must smile when
taking wedding photos.

377
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,800
No, my style is high class.

378
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,599
Your look can ward off evil.

379
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,760
An exorcism specialist.

380
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,599
Can't you let me sleep?

381
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,880
What is with that noise?

382
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,160
Why aren't you wearing your slippers?

383
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,079
You are awake.

384
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:01,920
I am scared I might disturb you sleeping
from walking around.

385
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
You already bothered me.

386
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,239
Put them on.

387
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,359
Thanks.

388
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,560
Are you making breakfast?

389
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,319
Forget about it then. Just make it.

390
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,880
If you are not quick enough,
you are going to be late.

391
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:06,520
I am sorry.

392
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,880
I will come out after I change.

393
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Seeing how sincere you are,

394
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,160
I will just eat at the office.

395
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,239
Good morning, everyone.

396
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,520
Finders keepers!

397
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,959
This belongs to someone.

398
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,160
Are you trying to bribe Mr. Jiang?

399
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,479
I won't discriminate against you
for going through the back door.

400
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,119
But you have to compete fairly with me.

401
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,280
You look like Momo
when you lose your temper.

402
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,359
Who's Momo?

403
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,439
A cat.

404
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,280
Why you...

405
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,160
Enough.

406
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,520
Stop fooling around.

407
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,560
Da Huang.

408
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,719
Da Huang.

409
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,319
Da Huang!

410
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:54,599
What's up?

411
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,839
Is Mr. Jiang here?

412
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,079
Stop dreaming already.

413
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,359
Have you prepared
your project demonstration?

414
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,959
You scared me to death.

415
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,920
I finished it last night.

416
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:03,839
All right.

417
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
You better drink some coffee
to freshen up.

418
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:06,920
Everyone, listen up.

419
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,560
The investor

420
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,560
not only wants to see the game,

421
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,880
but he also wants to see
the game developers.

422
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,359
So don't ever embarrass
Mr. Jiang today.

423
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,760
All right.

424
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,520
Da Huang,

425
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,719
why are you so sleepy?

426
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,959
Did you work overtime last night?

427
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:33,000
No, I was playing games
with my girlfriend.

428
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Your girlfriend is
more important than your life.

429
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,959
Single people like you won't get it.

430
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,520
This is the burden of happiness.

431
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,479
It's almost time.

432
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,239
Everyone,

433
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,880
let's show respect to
such an important occasion

434
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
by being less chatty.

435
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,439
Let us all dress up.

436
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,319
Why didn't she send food to my office?

437
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
(Is Koala Lu)

438
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,160
(too busy to send food to me?)

439
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,120
(Research Center, Manager)

440
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,680
I was wondering

441
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,079
why the programmers eat in the office.

442
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,359
So it was you who started it.

443
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,239
It is an exceptional situation today.

444
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,760
Lu Li made all these.

445
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,359
I know it doesn't taste good
by looking at it.

446
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,599
It looks pretty good.

447
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,839
Also, these taste pretty good.

448
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,800
Do you want to try?

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,280
Do you think I will just eat anything
because I am hungry?

450
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,640
By the way,

451
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,400
where did you go yesterday?

452
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,640
You didn't reply to my messages.

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I was taking care of something
with my mom.

454
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,079
That's a coincidence.

455
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,119
Lu Li also applied for a
day off to help her mom out.

456
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,560
I will get going first.

457
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,880
By the way,

458
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,119
200 yuan fine for having
breakfast in the office.

459
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,400
Report to HR yourself.

460
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,880
Since when do you care

461
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,160
about the company's
rules and regulations?

462
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,079
Now.

463
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,840
(Path of Heroes)
Our game

464
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,839
focuses on the combat experience

465
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,640
of the players during battle.

466
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,839
The movement of the character

467
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,560
is the key element in highlighting
the combat experience the most.

468
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,959
From the art motion
to the program variable speed,

469
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,959
we have met the players' needs
of a higher standard.

470
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:32,280
Let's take a look
at the demo version of the game.

471
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,479
Lei.

472
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,560
You can start now.

473
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,980
(Path of Heroes)

474
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
(Attack)

475
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,079
Enough, stop it.

476
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,280
I apologize, Mr. Ma.

477
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,280
This is not a qualified game demo.

478
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,560
It is regretful.

479
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,040
This project of yours

480
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,400
is indeed not bad.

481
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
But your competence

482
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,880
and working attitude

483
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,599
are still questionable.

484
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,000
I guess this is it then.

485
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,199
I am busy so I will excuse myself.

486
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,839
Mr. Ma, let me send you off.

487
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,520
What is going on?

488
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,199
Mr. Jiang,

489
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,400
we completed this demo in groups,

490
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,160
but Da Huang is in charge
of the decision box.

491
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,800
After years of developing games,

492
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,680
can you still make such mistakes?

493
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,319
I am sorry, Mr. Jiang.

494
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,119
It is my fault.

495
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,640
Do not give me such nonsense.

496
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,599
Because of your negligence,

497
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,599
everyone's efforts for half a year
have been wasted.

498
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,880
Do you think apologizing
can compensate for it?

499
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,599
I know, Mr. Jiang.

500
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,959
Don't call me that.

501
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,839
You do not deserve
to be part of this team.

502
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,760
I will give you three days
to hand over your duties!

503
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,680
Mr. Jiang.

504
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,319
When Mr. Ma left, he said
to discuss the investment later.

505
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,079
He is likely brushing us off.

506
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,640
Chendong also wants
to cooperate with him.

507
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,800
The moment he left the company,

508
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,520
he received a call from Xu Yuanzi.

509
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,280
Xu Yuanzi is currently
in a divorce lawsuit.

510
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,199
It seems that he has become
a trending topic these few days.

511
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,239
When I spare some time,

512
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,959
I will make him pay for what
he owes me even more.

513
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,760
Didn't I ask
if you have prepared it this morning?

514
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,800
You assured me that you had done it.

515
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,760
If you have time to sleep,

516
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,640
why didn't you test it?

517
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,839
Mr. Jiang won't be this upset then.

518
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,760
Enough already, Old Ape.

519
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,359
I was hired by Mr. Jiang.

520
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,040
He does not want me anymore.

521
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,719
I...

522
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,119
Tell me

523
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,319
what I should do now?

524
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,800
What should I do?

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,439
Since you joined the company,

526
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,280
you have made a total of three mistakes.

527
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,439
But the first two were
technical difficulties.

528
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,959
However, making such a basic mistake

529
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,599
is a first for you.

530
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,160
Everyone in the company knows

531
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,359
that programming team A
is Mr. Jiang's baby.

532
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,680
I guess Mr. Jiang feels
you have humiliated him.

533
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,280
Da Huang,

534
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,400
are you feeling exhausted lately?

535
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,400
If the work pressure and
workload are too heavy,

536
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:38,000
just tell Mr. Jiang.

537
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,079
He will handle it at his discretion.

538
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,839
I... I have been
a little tired recently.

539
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,000
I was only accompanying my girlfriend.

540
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,920
You all know that
she is a game streamer.

541
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,439
So I just played games with her.

542
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,959
I kept my girlfriend company,

543
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,640
but my job was ruined.

544
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,719
Speaking of which,

545
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,959
this may be Da Huang's fault.

546
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,959
But for Mr. Jiang to fire him,

547
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,839
don't you think it is too serious?

548
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:09,839
He is right.

549
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,800
Lu Li,

550
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,079
how do I usually treat you?

551
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,959
Just be frank.

552
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:25,280
I am wondering if you
can plead with Mr. Jiang.

553
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:30,560
He... He may not listen to me.

554
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,520
You have been bringing
breakfast for him lately.

555
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,119
Also, don't you guys get along recently?

556
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,160
That is not...

557
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,040
Lu Li,

558
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,119
please.

559
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,520
Just give it a try.

560
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,920
Even Mr. Jiang let you stay.

561
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,439
If you do not help me this time,

562
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,280
I... I really do not know what to do.

563
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,280
Lu,

564
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,599
Da Huang is right. Why don't you try?

565
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,880
Lu.

566
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,680
All right.

567
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,959
I will try.

568
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,439
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Chen.

569
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,599
I will get back to work then.

570
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:11,520
Mr. Jiang,

571
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,120
this is the monthly report
of programming team A.

572
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,439
Put it there.

573
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,919
Anything else?

574
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,479
Mr. Jiang,

575
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,879
have you heard of

576
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,320
Napoleon's expedition to Italy?

577
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,560
Continue.

578
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,320
Napoleon went on a patrol one night

579
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
and found a soldier on duty asleep.

580
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,320
During the war,

581
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
a soldier's momentary negligence

582
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,800
could destroy the whole army.

583
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
But Napoleon did not wake him.

584
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,679
Instead, he took his gun
and stood guard for him.

585
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,800
After the soldier woke up,
he felt touched.

586
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,800
From that moment,
he fought bravely in battle.

587
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,320
Are you pleading for Huang Renxun?

588
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,199
Mr. Jiang,

589
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,199
Da Huang is remorsefully
reflecting on himself.

590
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,159
Can you consider

591
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,919
and give him another chance?

592
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,840
If the soldier's mistake

593
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,360
had caused losses to the army,

594
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,560
how do you think
Napoleon would punish him?

595
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,719
Napoleon will be tolerant
and be considerate of his soldiers.

596
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,199
After that, he would
punish them lightly.

597
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,159
It will not only establish
the prestige of leadership.

598
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,520
But also increase the combat
effectiveness of the army.

599
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,879
If one unintentional mistake
becomes the reason

600
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
to dismiss an employee who
has worked here for years,

601
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:39,000
other employers will feel upset.

602
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,719
I am not Napoleon.

603
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
It is all about gains
and losses in business.

604
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,959
I do not care about
an incompetent loser.

605
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,439
Let alone what others think of me.

606
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,399
Everyone should pay
for their own mistakes.

607
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,560
This price is too much to pay.

608
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,879
Can you give him a chance
to make up for his mistake?

609
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,360
If we can change

610
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,600
the investor's mind,

611
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
just let Da Huang stay,

612
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,000
okay?

613
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,760
You are concerned with so many people.

614
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Which identity are you
using to negotiate with me?

615
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,199
A subordinate who joined
the company using a connection

616
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,159
or my wife registered
in the household register?

617
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,679
I am just discussing this matter.

618
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,959
I hope you can calm down

619
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,520
and consider this matter.

620
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,679
Lu Li,

621
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:22,679
you are the one who needs to calm down.

622
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:23,800
Do you really think

623
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,120
you are the owner's wife?

624
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,040
Do you really think

625
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,719
you can intervene in my decision?

626
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:28,719
Wake up.

627
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
You are just Mrs. Jiang on paper.

628
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:31,679
Get out.

629
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:56,560
Take this.

630
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,600
Wait for me.

631
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,840
Don't tell me
she failed to persuade him

632
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
and ended up being scolded
by Mr. Jiang.

633
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,159
(Do you really think)

634
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,679
(you're the owner's wife?)

635
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:10,639
(Do you really think)

636
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,360
(you can intervene in my decision?)

637
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,399
(Wake up.)

638
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,600
(You are just Mrs. Jiang on paper.)

639
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,560
Mr. Chen.

640
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,560
Do you mind sharing some space?

641
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,679
You went to plead for Da Huang?

642
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,399
I failed

643
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,919
and was scolded too.

644
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,879
When Yicheng is mad,

645
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,439
he may be hurtful with his words.

646
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
So don't take it to heart.

647
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:45,919
After he has calmed down,
it will be okay.

648
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,600
I do not know

649
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,800
why he must be so upset.

650
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,760
Da Huang did make a mistake,

651
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,679
but there is no need to fire him.

652
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,760
Between colleagues,

653
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,600
you can have friendship
and mutual affection.

654
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,199
But as a leader,

655
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,360
he must be responsible
for the whole company.

656
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,719
So he can only stand in
his position as a leader first

657
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,959
and friendship after.

658
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,719
It is not that he does not care.

659
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,080
He just cannot.

660
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,120
But this handling
method is too extreme.

661
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Can't he leave any leeway
for him at all?

662
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,373
(Good Luck. We will
walk to victory with you.)

663
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,639
(Please raise your hand.)

664
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,840
(Put down your thumb)

665
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,879
(your ring finger and your pinky)

666
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,479
(Good luck.)

667
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,840
(We will walk to victory with you.)

668
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,919
Childish.

669
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:47,879
(Do you really think)

670
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,199
you are the owner's wife?

671
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,199
Do you really think

672
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,000
you can intervene in my decision?

673
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,760
You are just Mrs. Jiang on paper.

674
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,840
Get out.

675
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,639
I was just stating the facts.

676
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,399
She is the one
who has poor distress tolerance.

677
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Mr. Jiang,

678
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,679
your lunch is here.

679
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,040
I brought it up for you while at it.

680
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:13,879
I did not order any lunch.

681
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,040
It is yours.

682
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,239
It says here, "For Mr. Jiang".

683
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,199
(Do not abuse your stomach)

684
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,679
(Delivery Check. Guest: Mr. Jiang)
(because of the mistake of others.)

685
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,280
(Do not throw it away.)

686
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,840
(Wasting is shameful.)

687
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,080
Where is Lu Li?

688
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,479
She with Mr. Chen at the stairs.

689
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,199
I will excuse myself then.

690
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,959
Everyone has their own ways
of handling matters.

691
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,919
You just step into society.

692
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,439
You will slowly discover
how cruel the workplace is.

693
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,760
All right.

694
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,520
Let's put these aside for now.

695
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,040
We'll discuss this after we help
Da Huang fix the demo.

696
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,800
Since programmers like us

697
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,040
are good at solving problems.

698
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,879
What are you doing here?

699
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,439
You really pick a great time.

700
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
We are badmouthing you.

701
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,479
I will get back to work first.

702
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,399
What is wrong?

703
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,080
Was I interrupting you two?

704
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,919
Can you be more gentle with her?

705
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,399
Am I not gentleman enough,

706
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,439
Mrs. Jiang?

707
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,919
You are finally back.

708
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,239
I have been waiting for you all day.

709
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Yicheng and Lu Li are married?

710
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:58,600
Yes.

711
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,120
How did you know?

712
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,560
I didn't say anything.

713
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,520
Your brother told me.

714
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:06,840
When did they get married?

715
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,080
They registered two days ago.

716
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,760
Yiming,

717
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,399
are you angry?

718
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,040
I was not hiding it
from you on purpose.

719
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,159
Yicheng said he wanted to keep
his marriage a secret

720
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,439
and forbade me to tell anyone.

721
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,320
I am not angry.

722
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,719
It was just too sudden.

723
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:26,840
I have not snapped out of it.

724
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:31,479
It has not been long since
they knew each other, right?

725
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:34,040
If my mom gives her instruction,

726
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,280
my brother will have
to marry at anytime.

727
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:39,399
Yiming,

728
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,959
when are you taking
me to meet your parents?

729
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:46,600
Sit there.

730
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,879
I will pour you a cup of coffee.

731
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,760
Okay.

732
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,120
I want it made with extra love.

733
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,199
All right.

734
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,840
Didn't you say to keep
our marriage a secret?

735
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,439
Is it affecting the development of
your relationship with Chen Yiming?

736
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,399
If you really like him,

737
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,840
why did you marry me?

738
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,520
I have told you

739
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,040
that I just worship him.

740
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,560
Women's love for men
comes from worshiping.

741
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,959
Why is it so hard
communicating with you?

742
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,919
I was right

743
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,239
so you are upset.

744
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,080
Mr. Jiang, you said so yourself.

745
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,520
We must keep our distance
and not talk about private matters.

746
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,679
No matter what, I am
still your husband in the name.

747
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,879
When you are too close to another man,

748
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,399
don't I have the right to ask?

749
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,360
Fine, you have the right to ask.

750
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:39,879
I have the right not to answer.

751
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,080
You...

752
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,040
Don't come back then.

753
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,439
All the food is mine alone.

754
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,399
(Everyone plays a
different role in a game.)

755
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,080
(Some may be the main attack.)

756
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,600
(Some may be the support.)

757
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:26,439
(There may be members
who drag you down.)

758
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,679
(But there will also be
God's help to turn the tide.)

759
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,479
(As long as everyone has the same goal,)

760
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,520
(we can work together
to achieve a greater effect.)
