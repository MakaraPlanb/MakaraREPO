I feel like I'm losing my hair.

22
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,599
Brother Lei,

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,360
let's go.

24
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:58,959
Wash our faces.

25
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,680
Lu Li.

26
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,199
Give this demo to Mr. Jiang.

27
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm afraid he'll blow up if he sees me.

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,199
Okay.

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,759
But he isn't here yet.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
I can only give it to him
in the afternoon.

31
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,600
You should take a nap.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Xunxun.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
You know that woman?

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,479
She openly challenged me
on stream live video.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,399
Help me.

36
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,119
But I...

37
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,559
I just pulled an all-nighter to work.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
Can we do this some other day?

39
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,880
Fine then!

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,759
Let the whole Internet laugh at me.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,199
Lu Li.

42
00:02:58,559 --> 00:02:59,360
I have to

43
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,600
go out for a while.

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,639
Since I'm free now.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,759
I'll be back soon.

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,639
If there is any news from Mr. Jiang,

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
get in touch with me.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,479
Bye.

50
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,279
I thought you wouldn't come.

51
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,720
I was afraid you'd be angry.

52
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,559
So I thought

53
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,080
I should drop by for a minute.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
At least you still care about me.

55
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,559
So,

56
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,880
if you're tired, you may lie down

57
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,960
until I call you.

58
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,279
I can't rest.

59
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,679
I got into trouble with my boss.

60
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,039
He's going to fire me.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,039
That's horrible.

62
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,279
Perhaps we can find time

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,679
to take him to dinner
or make him a gift.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,440
No.

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,000
He hates those kinds of pretenses.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
It's him.

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,720
Do you need me now?

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,119
All right.

70
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,960
I'll be right over.

71
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,559
What is it?

72
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,039
Mr. Jiang wants to see me.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,520
So I can't join you.

74
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,240
It's all right.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,679
Your work matters more, right?

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,399
Perhaps you can take me along.

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,199
Well,

78
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,360
I can persuade him for you.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,919
Hang tight.

80
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:26,799
Mr. Jiang.

81
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,720
This is my girlfriend, Xuanxuan.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I was with her

83
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,040
when you called me.

84
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,640
So I took her along.

85
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

86
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,959
I hope you don't mind.

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,399
Sit down.

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,760
Come on.

89
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,079
I heard you have reflected

90
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880
on your errors.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,079
I...

92
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,839
I shouldn't have let my personal affairs

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
interfere with my work.

94
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,839
And by complacently failing
to investigate the matter,

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,200
I have made a basic mistake.

96
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
And?

97
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,119
There's more?

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,519
I took some time off
to set out this morning.

99
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,320
You're afraid to admit your mistakes,

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
so you brought a woman

101
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,799
to be your lobbyist.

102
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,119
Is that how you reflect on your error?

103
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,519
No,

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,279
it's not.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,239
I was thinking,

106
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,600
you and Lu Li
have a special relationship,

107
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,679
so I thought

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,200
you'd be more delighted
to see her than to see me.

109
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,679
What's so special between her and me?

110
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
But you granted her special admission
to the Programming Team,

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,239
and you meet her in the office casually.

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,279
You're a smart ass.

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
If you dedicated
some of that shrewdness of yours

114
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,880
to your work,

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,279
we wouldn't be meeting here.

116
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,720
Now what?

117
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,399
What...

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,160
What do you mean, Mr. Jiang?

119
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,640
I've been with you all along.

120
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,600
You taught me programming.

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,320
I never thought about
leaving the company

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,519
or you.

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,239
Now you're scared.

124
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,559
Mr. Jiang, I...

125
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,359
To be honest,

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,200
I haven't slept for days.

127
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,799
I told you a long time ago.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,959
It takes teamwork to make a game.

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,559
I didn't ask for each of you

130
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,760
to be all like Lin Shutian,

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,119
a game genius.

132
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,480
But at least, every one of you

133
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,600
has grown at ease

134
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,760
in your respective fields.

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,519
If one person makes a mistake,

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,239
the whole team fails.

137
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,679
Not just the boss,

138
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,320
but also your teammates

139
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,040
will begin to doubt if you

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,799
can still be part of the team.

141
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,440
Mr. Jiang, I...

142
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,480
I know I messed up the project.

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Even if they don't say it,

144
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,320
I know that deep down
they're upset with me.

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,359
Actually, I...

146
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,679
Even I lack faith in myself.

147
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,239
Dissatisfaction and accidents at work

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,519
are inevitable.

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
But at my company,

150
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,040
there is no room for avoidable errors.

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,679
I know.

152
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,920
One more screw-up, and off you go.

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
But...

154
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,760
You're not firing me?

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
If I hadn't said that,

156
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,079
would you learn your lesson?

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
You're right.

158
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,959
I'm just worried

159
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,079
that I'd lose face if you left.

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Come to work on time in the afternoon.

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

162
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,880
So, shall we go now?

163
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,640
I'll leave you at peace.

164
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,320
Let's go.

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,959
Come on.

166
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,799
See you in the afternoon.

167
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Mr. Jiang.

168
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,160
I thought you wouldn't show up again.

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,119
This is a revised demo of the game.

170
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
Is this why you stayed overnight?

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,959
You wanted some practical benefits.

172
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
If our Programming Team can

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,079
get a chance for the investors
to re-evaluate,

174
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,839
can Da Huang stay?

175
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,720
No.

176
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,679
Why?

177
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,679
I understand your responsibility
to the company as a boss.

178
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
So can't you be a little more lenient

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
if we can make up for our losses?

180
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,079
Napoleon would

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,359
stand guard for his soldiers once,

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,799
but if his soldiers dozed off again,

183
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,920
what could he do?

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Could he stand guard for them forever?

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,239
What do you mean?

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I mean,

187
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,959
your pointless solution

188
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
can't even solve the fundamental issue.

189
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Why are you bringing me to the hotel?

190
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,880
You said we had work to do.

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
Gosh, you've been grumbling all the way.

192
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,760
Stay here.

193
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,920
Someone will be here in a moment.

194
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,880
Just improvise.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What are you doing here?

196
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,599
And what about you?

197
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
Mr. Jiang asked me to come.

198
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,440
He also told me to keep it down.

199
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,440
But,

200
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,880
this morning, I...

201
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,159
Xuanxuan?

202
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,799
You know her?

203
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
She's my girlfriend.

204
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,340
(Jiang Yicheng)

205
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,359
How efficient of you, Mr. Jiang.

206
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,000
We meet again after our brief parting.

207
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
I want to see you.

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
What do you mean?

209
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,039
I have a boyfriend, you know.

210
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
I see.

211
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,159
Looks like I got it all wrong.

212
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't see anything wrong with this.

213
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,640
What should we do with Huang Renxun?

214
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,719
I don't like him so much anyway.

215
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,840
I only needed him as my gaming partner.

216
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,280
But I have you now, right?

217
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,119
But...

218
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,960
I don't like complicated relationships.

219
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,479
Why you...

220
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,000
Calm down!

221
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,960
Calm down.

222
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:36,719
Hey,

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
aren't you supposed to be
back at work today?

224
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,039
Are you breaking up with me?

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Fine, I agree.

226
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,799
Good grief, Huang Renxun.

227
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,239
You worked with them to set me up.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,679
You're the villain here.

229
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,159
Very well.

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

231
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,520
I misjudged her

232
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,520
so much that you'd hook her up
to help me out of it.

233
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,039
You should be more cautious

234
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,119
when you get a new girlfriend.

235
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,679
I didn't have a choice.

236
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,280
How did you get to know her?

237
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,400
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,599
His ex gave me this.

239
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,719
Lu Li.

240
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,359
You pay the bill

241
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,000
while I wash my hands.

242
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,039
I was wrong.

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
What?

244
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,799
Seriously?

245
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
I got dumped,

246
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,239
so why are you so down about it?

247
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,239
I misunderstood Mr. Jiang.

248
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,200
I was disappointed in him yesterday.

249
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
You don't know him well enough.

250
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,359
He may look cold, ruthless,

251
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,479
and apathetic all around,

252
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,000
but

253
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,400
he knows everything in our office.

254
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
At any critical moment,

255
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,719
he'll spring into action
to get it all under control.

256
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,119
Even in capturing hearts,

257
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,280
he doesn't miss a single catch.

258
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,559
(I should've known it.)

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,679
(He's so smart.)

260
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,719
(He wouldn't make that mistake.)

261
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,119
Where's Da Huang?

262
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,280
He went back to work.

263
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,200
Do you want to order something to eat?

264
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,880
It's all on me.

265
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,599
I don't want to share a meal
with an airhead.

266
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,320
Sure, I'm too naive

267
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,479
to appreciate the strategy
of your brilliant mind.

268
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,880
So please don't be so calculating
with a rookie like me,

269
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,880
okay?

270
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,159
That depends on my mood.

271
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,760
You're the most perfect person I know.

272
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,000
You're the most talented
programmer in the IT industry,

273
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,440
the most business-minded boss
among programmers,

274
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,599
the best gamer among the bosses,

275
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,400
the best overachiever among the gamers,

276
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,239
and the most handsome
among overachievers.

277
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,119
Well, are you happy now?

278
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,119
Petty bootlicker.

279
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,159
I have many more compliments coming.

280
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,559
Would you care to hear me out?

281
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
(Specialities)

282
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,200
Stare at me, and I'll have to charge.

283
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm worshiping you with my gaze.

284
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,080
I didn't see you so fired-up

285
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,919
when you argued with me.

286
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,479
I'm ready to order.

287
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,679
We'd like one set
of the chef's recommendations.

288
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,679
What drink do you want?

289
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,760
Orange juice.

290
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,359
Do you have iced milk tea?

291
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,080
Sorry,

292
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,239
we don't have any.

293
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,960
Then I'll have water instead.

294
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,479
Yes, sir.

295
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,400

from each shop.

00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,319
Just sit down.

376
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,959
Sit down

377
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,119
and listen to me.

378
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,680
You witnessed my breakup.

379
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,439
How could you leave me behind

380
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,439
when I am the most vulnerable?

381
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,560
You can go see Mr. Jiang about it.

382
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,079
Don't bring him up.

383
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,239
He managed to

384
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,000
win my girlfriend over

385
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,640
with just a few words.

386
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,199
I'm at the lowest point in my life,

387
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,599
and it's getting even worse.

388
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm telling you,

389
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,280
I can't take any more upsets.

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,280
You're too young to complain

391
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,920
about your lowest point in life

392
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,119
that's getting lower or whatever.

393
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,520
You still have a lot of room to fall.

394
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Li!

395
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
Xiaoqi.

396
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,560
I...

397
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
I've seen you before.

398
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,599
You're Lu Li's girlfriend?

399
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,959
My best friend, Xiaoqi.

400
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:18,160
My colleague, Da Huang.

401
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,359
Hello, Da Huang.

402
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,280
Fairy Qi,

403
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,560
I mean...

404
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,319
Hello to you too, Xiaoqi.

405
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,640
Da Huang, could I

406
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,000
have a moment with my best friend?

407
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes, of course.

408
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:30,760
You girls go ahead.

409
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,119
I'll be gone now.

410
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:32,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

411
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:33,640
Bye.

412
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Bye.

413
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,239
He's gone now.

414
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,000
Come on.

415
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:40,560
Let's get down to business.

416
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,079
What's up with you and Jiang Yicheng?

417
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,239
Thank you.

418
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,479
Thank you.

419
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,920
I don't know what's going on,

420
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
but he suddenly got angry yesterday.

421
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,280
But he didn't fire your colleague, right?

422
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,520
What did you do to him?

423
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,199
I don't know.

424
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,239
He was okay when we had
dinner last night.

425
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,040
Everything was going fine.

426
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,319
And then,

427
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,520
when we got out,

428
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,359
he got into a fit.

429
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:09,040
He was still angry even at home.

430
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,880
One day he's nice,
and the next day he's nasty.

431
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,839
Is he schizophrenic?

432
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,239
Schizophrenic would be
an understatement.

433
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,199
At least he'd be predictable.

434
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,959
Let's look a little deeper.

435
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:26,239
Do you notice anything unusual
about him lately?

436
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,599
Yes.

437
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
If you like him so much,

438
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,760
why marry me?

439
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,239
I'm just admiring him.

440
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,439
A girl's admiration for a man
always turns into a crush.

441
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,520
Maybe he's jealous!

442
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,599
Li,

443
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,599
you've finally made it!

444
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,520
I don't think so.

445
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,079
Even if he's jealous,

446
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,400
he certainly won't
be jealous because of me.

447
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,560
You're right.

448
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,079
After all, his relationship
with Chen Yiming

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,439
was longer than that with you.

450
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,560
But now,

451
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,920
he's officially your husband.

452
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,160
Even if he's

453
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,153
not jealous because of you
like a husband is to a wife,

454
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,599
it could be he's too possessive.

455
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,319
A Leo does not allow others

456
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,560
to violate his domain and authority.

457
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,520
I don't think he's a lot like that.

458
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
If you keep on doubting like this,

459
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,280
you're never going to be in love.

460
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,400
It's easier for a girl to ask a guy out.

461
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,119
You know what?

462
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,079
Ask him out to
a fine restaurant tonight,

463
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:31,239
then if you find the right topic,

464
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,520
you can try to confess to him.

465
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Can't you see

466
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,479
there's a barbed wire between us?

467
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,599
What if he...

468
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,040
turns me down?

469
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,839
What should I do?

470
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,760
That will be embarrassing.

471
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,000
It always takes one hothead

472
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,000
to keep a relationship going, right?

473
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,719
Just put it to rest.

474
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,359
It'll only make things more complicated.

475
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,119
That's it,

476
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,599
let's go.

477
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,839
I'm getting you your makeup.

478
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,400
Come on.

479
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,560
But I have to get back to work.

480
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,199
Forget it.

481
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,400
Your confession matters more.

482
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,119
Come on...

483
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,280
My bag.

484
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:57,839
Come on,

485
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,560
quick.

486
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,479
(Do you want to join me
for dinner tonight?)

487
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,439
(I should've treated you yesterday.)

488
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,079
It's been three years.

489
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
Here you are, at last.

490
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,479
It's been a while, Yicheng.

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,959
Looks like you're doing fine, Miss Li.

492
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,000
You used to call me Man.

493
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,599
Thanks for reminding me.

494
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,520
Did you spend all the money

495
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,680
you took from me?

496
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,880
How do you plan to extract money
from me this time?

497
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm back

498
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,920
because this is where
I had my happiest memories.

499
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,920
I miss this place so much.

500
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,359
And I miss you even more.

501
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,839
Li Man.

502
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,479
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

503
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,439
You have no right to be here.

504
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,560
You're right.

505
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,040
I have no right to be here.

506
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,959
But believe it or not,

507
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,400
in the past three years,

508
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,680
I lived every day
on the verge of despair.

509
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,760
If you want to confess to me,

510
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
you've come to the wrong place.

511
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,160
I am not God.

512
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,040
I can't absolve you of your guilt.

513
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,520
Now get lost.

514
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,599
Mom, Dad.

515
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,280
You're not home yet?

516
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
I'm dining out.

517
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,040
See?

518
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,599
Where is Jiang?

519
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,119
He went to the restroom.

520
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,079
He'll be back soon.

521
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,439
By the way,

522
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,319
you never visited us
since you got married.

523
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Tomorrow,

524
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,359
we'd like you
to take him home after work.

525
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,959
We'll cook something delicious for you.

526
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,599
Yes.

527
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,560
Dad, he's been busy every day.

528
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,040
He's always overtime.

529
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,239
So he's been busy all the time
since you got married.

530
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,319
Doesn't he even have time for dinner?

531
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,239
He is busy.

532
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,319
Just wait for us.

533
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
We'll surely drop by someday.

534
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,520
Li, tell me the truth.

535
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,040
He doesn't like to visit us, does he?

536
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,439
No way.

537
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,719
You're overthinking it.

538
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,479
Am I?

539
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,560
You had no time for a wedding.

540
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,359
You didn't even have a ring,

541
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,119
did you?

542
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,479
I don't think he takes you seriously!

543
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,199
There, there.

544
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,319
Right?

545
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,719
Mom, as you know,

546
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,239
I usually don't like
putting on makeup and stuff.

547
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,319
If I put them on every day,

548
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,959
it'd be hard for me to type.

549
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,640
Right?

550
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,439
Yes.

551
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,719
Silly girl.

552
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,119
Listen to me.

553
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,239
No matter how much you like him,

554
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
you can't just blindly put up with him.

555
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,719
Mom, Yicheng is back.

556
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,920
I must hang up now.

557
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,239
Bye.

558
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,119
Wash the dishes.

559
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,239
I won't put up with your manner.

560
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Excuse me, Miss Lu.

561
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,560
Our kitchen is about to close.

562
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,880
Shall I serve
your pre-ordered dishes now?

563
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,599
You weren't into the game.

564
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,079
Who did this to you?

565
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
She's back.

566
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,319
Li Man?

567
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,800
You still haven't forgotten her

568
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,199
after three years?

569
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
If she hadn't shown up,

570
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,359
I would've forgotten all about her.

571
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,040
If I remember correctly,

572
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,680
she was your first love.

573
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,520
Your first love who betrayed you.

574
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,520
Will you forget her with this grudge?

575
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,880
You know how busy I've been lately.

576
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:50,520
Besides,

577
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm a guy who lives in the moment.

578
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:54,280
I'm not going to waste my breath on her.

579
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
Glad you're cool about it.

580
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,359
Why did she come back?

581
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,439
To apologize to you?

582
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,479
There is probably more about it.

583
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,839
Does she know you're married?

584
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,479
And does Lu Li know
about the two of you?

585
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,160
Oh no!

586
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,160
I totally forgot about her.

587
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Keep the ball for me.

588
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,319
What's going on?

589
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,839
Sir, we're closed.

590
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,280
Hello.

591
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,199
Do you have a reservation
for Miss Lu Li?

592
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,239
We had a Miss Lu over there.

593
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,680
But she was waiting for someone.

594
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,239
Then she left as we closed.

595
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,400
Thank you.

596
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Sorry, I am late.

597
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,119
I'm glad you made it.

598
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,760
The restaurant is closed.

599
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,040
Why didn't you go back?

600
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,160
You didn't tell me you couldn't come,

601
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,079
so I believed you'd come.

602
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,479
If I left,

603
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,280
you'd be here for nothing.

604
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
You're silly.

605
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,479
Can't you use your phone?

606
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,319
You could've called me.

607
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,119
I knew you were held up,

608
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,199
so I didn't want to bother you.

609
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,599
You must be hungry.

610
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,239
Let's get something to eat.

611
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,239
Your three-star Michelin meal.

612
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,280
I got the takeout for you.

613
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,479
Here.

614
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,359
This foie gras is so delicious.

615
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,199
Why don't we have this
in Chinese cuisine?

616
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,839
Do you think of it as just foie gras?

617
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
It's an organ, right?

618
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,959
In France,

619
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,479
for the first 12 weeks or so
of a goose's life,

620
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,920
they'll force-feed it

621
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,160
with generous amounts of food.

622
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,839
This is how

623
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,040
the goose's liver grows very big.

624
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,839
The bigger the liver,

625
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,359
the higher it sells.

626
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,079
It's so cruel.

627
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,319
I'm not having this anymore.

628
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,599
I'll have this.

629
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,520
Did you strike a lottery?

630
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,880
Why did you take me
to that expensive restaurant?

631
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,160
(It's easier for a girl
to ask a guy out, you know?)

632
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,080
(You know what?)

633
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,919
Ask him out to
a fine restaurant tonight,

634
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,199
then if you find the right topic,

635
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,439
you can try to confess to him.

636
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,399
Actually,

637
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,479
I...

638
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,439
I have something to tell you.

639
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Thanks.

640
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Too bad.

641
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,879
My new dress just got ruined
on its first night.

642
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,639
By the way,

643
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,560
you dress differently today.

644
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,239
Why are you dressed up so formally?

645
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,520
This skirt is a wedding gift
from Xiaoqi.

646
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,239
So what were you about to say?

647
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,560
It's my parents.

648
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,199
They asked me about the wedding.

649
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,879
We have a one-year marriage contract.

650
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,679
We don't need to spend
so much time at the wedding.

651
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,800
But my parents don't think so.

652
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,959
Can I request something from you?

653
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,600
What?

654
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,879
A ring?

655
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,800
We didn't have a wedding,

656
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
so my parents were disappointed.

657
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,479
If you don't even have a wedding ring,

658
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,080
they will be suspicious of you.

659
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,479
Having a ring is so significant.

660
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,840
I don't want it to end up as a prop.

661
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,719
Give me your hand.

662
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,879
Just make do with this.

663
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,840
This is childish.

664
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,639
Childish?

665
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,159
I'll show you

666
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,159
something even more childish.

667
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,199
Is this the place you said

668
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,120
that would make me happy?

669
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,919
The level of luxury here
has exceeded my expectations.

670
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,040
I chartered it. Go on and play.

671
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:30,560
But this is for little kids.

672
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,840
You don't look mature either.

673
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,159
You wore a grade schooler's pajamas.

674
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:40,800
I told you.
It was my pajamas from high school.

675
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,120
Come on.

676
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,040
Don't tell me
you're afraid of this height.

677
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,120
I don't think it can bear
the weight of both of us.

678
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,719
See? It's shaking.

679
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,439
You'll know when you try it.

680
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:08,959
Go on.

681
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,320
But I...

682
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,280
Wait.

683
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,760
Sit tight.

684
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,959
My skirt...

685
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,159
No...

686
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:23,600
Did you like it?

687
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:24,600
Why you...

688
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,879
Did my mighty push

689
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,800
make the game even more fun?

690
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,560
Why don't you try it too?

691
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm way too manly for this.

692
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,840
But your manly shoes have laces!

693
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,679
You...

694
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,520
You forgot your bag!

695
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,080
You forgot your bag.

696
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,679
I don't get it.

697
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,040
This is a repetitive pendulum movement.

698
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,399
What's the fun in that?

699
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,800
Do you girls like to play on swings?

700
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:12,719
I think girls like to play on swings

701
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,320
because they expect

702
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,919
a boy to come over and push them up.

703
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
Do you want to give me a push,

704
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,760
Mr. Jiang?

705
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,520
This thing is a waste of energy.

706
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,479
No way.

707
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,120
Do you want to play a game?

708
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,479
What game?

709
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,280
I'll stand this far from you.

710
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,760
I give you three turns to swing.

711
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
If you can touch me,

712
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,080
I'll do you one favor.

713
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,600
If not, you do me one favor.

714
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,239
That's a bit far.

715
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,879
That's what a bet is all about.

716
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:57,919
Dare to try?

717
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,000
Let's do it.

718
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,600
You have one last chance.

719
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,760
I win.

720
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,800
You're pretty competitive

721
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,560
for a girl.

722
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,080
If I weren't here,

723
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,360
you would land on your face.

724
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,239
I want to take you

725
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,280
to dinner with my parents.

726
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:59,000
I thought you wanted a ring.

727
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,320
But you turned me down.

728
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
I know my limits.

729
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,840
All right.

730
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,360
We'll go to your place
for dinner with your parents.

731
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:48,959
Are you okay?

732
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah,

733
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm fine.

734
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:54,959
Are you stupid?

735
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:56,919
What's wrong with me?

736
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,560
A girl

737
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,800
must know when to seek help

738
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,840
instead of trying to tackle
everything by herself.

739
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,919
So can you help me?

740
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,040
Come on.

741
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,040
You look a little different today.

742
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:38,639
In a good way or bad way?

743
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,040
Your temper is better.

744
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,439
And you were being considerate enough

745
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,280
by taking me out to play.

746
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,399
Consider that as me making up
for being late.

747
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,320
Then why were you late just now?

748
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,320
Don't ask so much.

749
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,719
It's late.

750
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:25,800
Why don't you go and take a bath?

751
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:31,159
I'm not done wiping the door yet.

752
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,520
Then I'll go first.

753
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
(When the program was running,)

754
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,919
(an anomaly occurred.)

755
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,120
(Would you choose to abort the model
and eliminate the anomaly,)

756
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,399
(or choose to continue the model)

757
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,000
(and restore the current
runtime system?)
