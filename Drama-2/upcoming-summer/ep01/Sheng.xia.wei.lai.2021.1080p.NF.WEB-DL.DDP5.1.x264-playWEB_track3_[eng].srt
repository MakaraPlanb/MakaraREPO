{\an8}<i>to take</i>

00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,833

12
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,083
What a temper.

13
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,375
Okay.

14
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,708
Be careful, slow down.

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,708

Mom, you have a message…

18
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,291
This is for you.

19
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,958
The exam is right around the corner.

20
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,333
How can you let this happen?

21
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,416
How can you blame me?

22
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,250
As soon as I left, she disappeared.

I think you shouldn’t worry too much.

Just let things be.

27
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,125
<i>I've decided that Xiamen University
is my first choice.</i>

28
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,166
What did you fill out?

29
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,375
-Mine is Xiamen University of Technology.
-That's great.

30
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,000
We can still meet up in the future.

31
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,375
-Yes.
-Let's not talk about this.

32
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,583
Consider Chen Chen's feelings.
She must repeat the grade.

33
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,791
Just go on.

34
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,541
By the way, have you heard?

35
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,541
Zheng Yuxing from Class 4
skipped the exam.

36
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,708
Zheng Yuxing?

37
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,125
Who? I don't know him.

38
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,166
You don't know him?

39
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,125
Zheng Yuxing is so handsome.

40
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,333
Many girls are pursuing him.

41
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,916
-I heard
-I have no idea.

42
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,416
that he has
a much older girlfriend in Beijing.

43
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
-Yes, I heard about that too.
-Yes.

44
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,250
There were rumors in school
that he was dating.

45
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,375
Apparently, he'd disappear every weekend.

46
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,375
Do you think he was with his girlfriend
on the day of the exam?

47
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,833
It's like a Korean drama.

48
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,416
-That's what he said on TikTok.
-They love each other that much?

49
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,291
He was in a bad mood,
so he left for the airport.

50
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,750
He's too capricious,
even daring to skip the exam.

51
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,500
What on earth is he like?

52
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,000
<i>Great, we have to stay here another year.</i>

53
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,625
What can we do when our child is sick?

54
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,291
Sick?

55
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,333
Would she have gotten sick
if she didn't go out in the rain?

56
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,625
Did you ask her why?

57
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,500
Would she have told me?

58
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,750
True, you look too fierce.

59
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,125
Nobody wants to confide in you.

60
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,666
Ask her since you're so gentle.

61
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,583
Fine.

#LET'S HAVE FUN

63
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,458
Wait, put this in the cabinet for me.

64
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,583
{\an8}Chen Chen.

65
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,625
{\an8}Chen Chen, what are you doing?

66
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,625
It's too sunny here. Come inside.

67
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,541
Come on.

68
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
Come. I want to ask you something, okay?

69
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,458
Why did you go out in the rain that day?

70
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,666
No reason.

71
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,416
She's not telling you either.

72
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,000
Bring the rice cooker box in for me.

73
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
Listen, Chen Chen.

74
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,083
Don't think I'll let you off the hook
if you don't tell me.

75
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,291
Your dad and I sacrificed
so much for you to go to school.

76
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,666
I even quit my job.

77
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,333
We left our beautiful home
to rent such a crappy place

78
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,083
to be closer to your school for you
to focus on your studies, right?

79
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,791
You're a big girl now.

80
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
You don't feel bad
for your parents at all.

81
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,625
Can you not put so much pressure on her?

82
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,916
I'm giving her pressure?

83
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,916
Is it me then?

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,708
If you didn't,
would she have gone out in the rain?

85
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,500
Fine. All you do is pretend
to be the good guy.

86
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,583
I feel bad for her.

87
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,041
I'm not as pushy as you, okay?

88
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,666
-Who's pushy? How am I pushy?
-You're so pushy

89
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,875
that we can hardly breathe.

90
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,708
I'm the one being pushed by you two!

91
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,666
I got dumped.

92
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,625
That was why I ran out in the rain.

93
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,875
And I bombed my exam.

94
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,916
You've never dated,
how can you get dumped?

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,083
I have.

96
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,083
How…

97
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,166
You fell in love?

98
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,416
Look at you. You weren't even aware
that your daughter was dating.

99
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,666
When did that happen?

100
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,750
Are you feeling better now?

101
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,750
Yes.

102
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,666
Go and buy me some water.

103
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,666
Wait.

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
What?

105
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,875
Who was it? Who was your boyfriend?

106
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,500
A classmate.

107
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,583
Which one? Is he in your class?

108
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,500
Why are you asking so many questions?

109
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,416
We broke up.

110
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,125
We won't see each other again.

111
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,625
{\an8}Can you tell me who it was?

112
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,041
We broke up already. You…

113
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,375
What are you doing? It's locked.

114
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,833
-Why do you always check people's phones?
-You don't know the pin.

115
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,708
How do you know my pin?

116
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,375
Isn't it your dad's birthday?

117
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,666
Will you tell me or not?

118
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,541
I'll check it myself.

119
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,666
Give it to me.

120
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,791
Zheng Yuxing.

121
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,208
What's his name?

122
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,708
His name is Zheng Yuxing.

123
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,333
Are you okay?

124
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,750
I think…

125
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,708
Let's stop contacting each other.

126
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,541
Are you breaking up with me?

127
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,291
-You're going to miss your flight.
-Hey.

128
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,500
If you have concerns,

129
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,166
I can wait.

130
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,708
It's just another year at most.

131
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,625
{\an8}Just go.

132
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,000
{\an8}-You'll be late.
-If you don't tell me clearly,

133
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,416
{\an8}how can I leave in peace?

134
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,583
{\an8}If you don't go,
I'll delete you on WeChat.

135
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,916
{\an8}Stop joking around.

136
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,708
{\an8}I'm deleting it now.

137
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,791
{\an8}You…

138
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,583
Okay.

139
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,208
Fine. I'll go.

140
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm going.

141
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,583
Let's go.

142
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,208
I've inquired about Chen Chen's situation
with her previous teacher.

143
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,250
I've reviewed her grades as well.

144
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,916
She did well in the first three subjects.

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Only in the last subject, English,

146
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,166
did she fail.

147
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
-Correct.
-It was obviously due to her health.

148
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, the school is still
taking her seriously this year.

149
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,375
We specifically placed her
in the top class.

150
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,333
As long as she performs on par next year,

151
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
she should be able
to get into a top-tier university.

152
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,125
Then, let's…

153
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,708
Ms. Qu.

154
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,041
Actually, there was another reason
why Chen Chen did poorly last year.

155
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,583
-Stand up.
-Hey, the teacher is here.

156
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,625
-Hello, Ms. Qu.
-Hello, Ms. Qu.

157
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,666
Sit down.

158
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,208
Today, we will do the 2018 exam questions.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,541
I'll also take the time
to tell you something.

160
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,083
Chen Chen.

161
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,041
Please stand up.

162
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,541
Zheng Yuxing.

163
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,625
Stand up too.

164
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,541
Yuxing?

165
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,208
Come on.

166
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
You know why I called you two?

167
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,041
Let me formally
introduce you to everybody.

168
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,875
These two are the most tragic lovers

169
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,833
from our school last year.

170
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,791
Star-crossed lovers.

171
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,208
-What?
-You dare to say "What"?

172
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,583
Look at Chen Chen.

173
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,375
She has an attitude of repentance.

174
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,458
Chen Chen, on the left,

175
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,416
was a top student from last year's class.

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,291
Because of a breakup before the exam,

177
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,833
she ran out in the rain
in the middle of the night.

178
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,583
She thought… Stand properly.

179
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,958
She thought she was acting
in an idol drama.

180
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,166
And what happened?

181
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083
She fell seriously ill
and bombed the exam.

182
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,333
Zheng Yuxing, on the right,
is even more of a character.

183
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,750
The image of a young,
rebellious rule-breaker.

184
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,500
He didn't even show up to the exam.

185
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,250
He didn't show up?

186
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,333
How about that?

187
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,916
Isn't that a great story?

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,375
Wang Mingkun.

189
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,625
Swap seats with Chen Chen.

190
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,333
-What?
-"What"?

191
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,083
Zheng Yuxing, sit in the last row.

192
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,750
No matter
how we switch seats in the future,

193
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,250
you two are not moving.

194
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,583
Hey. What's going on?

195
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,041
Zheng Yuxing. What are you doing?

196
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,416
No, I…

197
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,791
I wanted to ask her.

198
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,958
About what?

199
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,833
-No, Ms. Qu. Today, we--
-There is no "we."

200
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,125
-"There is no 'we.'"
-Quiet.

201
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,083
Chen Chen has the right attitude now.

202
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,458
Do well in the exam next year.

203
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,166
If you want to date in college,

204
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,333
you can date however you want.

205
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,625
Sit down.

206
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,833
What you should do now
is improve your scores

207
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,791
and try to get
into the same college as her.

208
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,875
Otherwise, even if you don't break up now,

209
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,125
you will sooner or later.

210
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,708
All right. The rest of you,
please learn from this.

211
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,625
Class dismissed. Stand up.

212
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,333
-Goodbye, Ms. Qu.
-Goodbye, Ms. Qu.

213
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,583
Okay, sit down.

214
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,375
Finish the questions.

215
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,625
-Okay, miss.
-We still have to continue?

216
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,375
Chen Chen, right?

217
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,375
Can we…

218
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,583
How awkward.

219
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,250
-Go after her!
-Go after her!

220
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,000
-May I sit here?
-Yes.

221
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,416
Don't misunderstand.

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,375
{\an8}I just wanted to ask you about…

223
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,958
Hey, don't be so pathetic.

224
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,333
Why are you avoiding me?

225
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,750
Chen Chen, go in first.

226
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,458
Hey. You…

227
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,208
Stop it. She doesn't want to talk to you.

228
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,083
Dismissal is in five minutes.

229
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,416
You're leaving now?

230
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,666
Bye.

231
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,208
Hey.

232
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,083
Why are you following me?

233
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,166
What's wrong with following my girlfriend?

234
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,791
Who's your girlfriend?

235
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,416
Exactly. Who is my girlfriend?

236
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,916
Tell me.

237
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,666
Why did you lie?

238
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,958
Is it because you bombed the exam

239
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
and didn't know what to tell your parents,

240
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
so you made up a lie

241
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,458
and used me as an excuse?

242
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,333
-Come on, am I right?
-Yes.

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Really?

244
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,333
I guessed right? I really guessed right?

245
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,208
Hey, I thought about this the whole day,
and I finally got it. I…

246
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,166
That was actually what happened?

247
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,500
But you're way too bold.

248
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,375
What if I called you out
on your lie today?

249
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
-Wouldn't you be in serious trouble?
-No.

250
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,916
This was what happened.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,625
You didn't even take the exam.

252
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,625
Who knew
that you'd be back to repeat the grade?

253
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,333
How did you know I didn't take the exam?

254
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,583
-I just--
-Are you following my TikTok?

255
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,208
I apologize, okay?

256
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,958
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have used you as a scapegoat.

257
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,791
I won't ever disturb you anymore.

258
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,291
All right. Don't worry, bye.

259
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,625
Wait.

260
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,541
I have another question.

261
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,958
Out of all the guys in school, why me?

262
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,666
-Because--
-Is it because I'm handsome?

263
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,041
-I--
-You have a crush on me, don't you?

264
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,083
Don't go.

265
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
Don't be shy.

266
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,166
Even if our past was a lie,

267
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,958
we can make it real in the future!

268
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,083
-What's your problem?
-No…

269
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,916
Didn't you tell me that you two broke up?

270
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,916
Then why did the teacher tell me

271
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,416
that several people
spotted you two meeting in secret?

272
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,333
No.

273
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,125
Yes, we did meet.

274
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,125
But I just gave him a final warning
to not affect my studies.

275
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,041
-That was it.
-Did you delete his WeChat?

276
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,416
I did.

277
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,666
A long time ago. I'll show you.

278
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,791
-I don't want to check
-Senior 3 Class 10

279
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,000
-other people's phones.
-WeChat group.

280
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,083
Look, his name is Zheng Yuxing.

281
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,333
“Add to contact”. Not a friend, see?

282
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,916
-I believe you. I--
-Take a look.

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,458
I believe you.

284
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,583
Bring me another bottle.

285
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,583
When is my dad coming?

286
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,500
It has been ages since he last came.

287
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,666
Who knows? He's always so busy.

288
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,041
Tell him to come when he has time
and stay for a few days.

289
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,208
I miss him.

290
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,083
I'll send him a message tomorrow to ask.

291
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,166
Time to study.

292
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,208
-Bye.
-Eat this inside.

293
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,833
No, it's too much.

294
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,833
You eat it.

295
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:42,208
STOP SENDING LONGAN,
WE CAN'T FINISH THEM…

296
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,541
CONTACTS

297
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,541
FRIEND REQUEST

298
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,916
DJ_XYZ: I'M THE BOYFRIEND
YOU IMAGINED, ZHENG YUXING

299
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,375
Why are you running so fast?

300
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,833
You're rushing to self-study so soon?

301
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,500
Why are you running?
You can run quickly now?

302
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,208
-Do you want to play ball?
-Let's play soccer.

303
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,500
-Count me in.
-Did you bring the ball?

304
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,458
Zheng Yuxing,
why are you running backward?

305
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,833
Are you blind?
Don't you see who's behind him?

306
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,416
Look, I'm so envious.

307
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,083
-Hurry up!
-Give Zheng Yuxing a chance.

308
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,583
-What's the rush?
-Go after her!

309
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,583
-Go for it!
-Go after her!

310
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,750
-Go after her!
-Go after her!

311
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,583
You're not running anymore?

312
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,875
<i>Announcement.</i>

313
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,500
<i>Senior 3 Class 10</i>

314
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
<i>Zheng Yuxing and Chen Chen.</i>

315
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,583
<i>Report to the teacher's office now.</i>

316
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,291
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

317
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,083
Just now in PE class,
you kept running after Chen Chen.

318
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,625
What do you want?

319
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
Nothing, I just wanted to…

320
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,125
Get back together?

321
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,083
No.

322
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,333
I…

323
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,708
-I just wanted to ask her.
-Ask her what?

324
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
-Ms. Qu, ask her too. She's right here.
-I am asking you.

325
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,083
Don't shift the problem to others.

326
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,458
No, Ms. Qu.

327
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,500
-Actually, just now, he--
-Don't butt in.

328
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,708
Anyway, I didn't do anything.

329
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,125
You didn't do anything, right?

330
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,916
Then why did Chen Chen's mom
suddenly call me?

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,416
No. Ms. Qu,
it's really not what you think.

332
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,958
Then please tell me.

333
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,166
Tell me.

334
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,666
Speak.

335
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,708
Actually…

336
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,333
-I…
-Actually, I'm still clinging to her.

337
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,458
I can't let her go.

338
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,541
It's my fault.

339
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,541
I…

340
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,916
I won't bother her anymore.

341
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,208
That's right.

342
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,416
She already told you
she doesn't like you anymore.

343
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,750
Have a good closure.

344
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,791
Why do you have to bug her every day?

345
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,708
That way, you'll only make her
dislike you more, right?

346
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,541
Moreover, you aren't kids anymore, right?

347
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,333
Love is a two-way street, you know.

348
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,125
If you don't belong together,
then leave each other alone.

349
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,791
You're a man.

350
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,333
You need to have some dignity.

351
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,166
Girls don't need dignity?

352
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,833
-That's not what I mean. Don't set me up.
-Okay.

353
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,083
So stop bothering her.

354
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,375
Otherwise, you'll just appear childish.

355
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,208
What's the matter?

356
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,208
Was I too harsh?

357
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,625
Ms. Qu, I'm going to the restroom.

358
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,083
What do you want?

359
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,250
Can we talk?

360
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,333
About what?

361
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,791
Weren't you crying

362
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,291
just now?

363
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:33,875
Zheng Yuxing.

364
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:41,791
What?

365
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,500
What are you doing?

366
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,958
Nothing.

367
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,583
Did you get dumped?

368
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,375
None of your business.

369
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,958
Actually,

370
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm not in a good mood lately too.

371
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,166
What does it have to do with me?

372
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,416
How about this?

373
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,333
I'll tell you a secret,

374
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,666
and you tell me one too.

375
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,958
Isn't that how coming-of-age movies go?

376
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,416
I hate coming-of-age movies.

377
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Me too.

378
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,416
What's the secret?

379
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,958
The truth is…

380
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,250
I failed the exam

381
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,500
because I found out my parents
were having problems.

382
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,541
And then?

383
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,875
That's it.

384
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,083
Your turn.

385
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,291
Your secret.

386
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,541
What do you want to know?

387
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,625
You really got dumped?

388
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,333
I don't know if you can call it that.

389
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,625
We never made it official.

390
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,208
When she was nice to me,
I thought we were in a relationship.

391
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,708
But sometimes, she would be aloof,
saying that I was bothering her.

392
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,791
She was hard to deal with.

393
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:16,250
What is she like?

394
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,375
She's in Beijing,

395
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,458
eight years older, and a DJ.

396
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,750
DJ?

397
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,958
Someone that plays songs?

398
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,583
Take that back.

399
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,041
-Take it back.
-Okay, I take it back.

400
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,208
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,500
Why are you so worked up?

402
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,166
When did you break up?

403
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,958
Why so many questions?

404
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,750
A month before the exam.

405
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,708
She suddenly told me
not to contact her anymore.

406
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,125
She wouldn't reply to my messages.

407
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,708
She wouldn't answer my calls.

408
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,166
I felt so miserable back then.

409
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:59,375
I didn't understand
why she was so cruel to me.

410
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,041
The day before the exam,

411
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,791
I suddenly missed her a lot,
so I bought a plane ticket to Beijing.

412
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,625
I planned to come back
right after seeing her.

413
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,500
Even before I could say a word,
she started telling me off.

414
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,375
She called me childish

415
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,500
and told me to fly back immediately
for the exam.

416
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,666
I was so furious back then.

417
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,875
I thought, "You want me to take the exam?

418
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,541
Then I'll skip it."

419
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,625
Doesn't that really prove
that you are childish?

420
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,041
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,208
I didn't mean it that way.

422
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,458
You're pretty different

423
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,958
from what I see on TikTok.

424
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,500
Everything on my TikTok is for her.

425
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,583
You know what?

426
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,708
Every TikTok video I make
receives hundreds of likes from people.

427
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,166
I would check each one just to see

428
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,500
if she was one of them.

429
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:53,666
Was she?

430
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,958
Never.

431
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,250
But I think it's because
she still likes me.

432
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,750
If she doesn't like me anymore,

433
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:08,708
then liking my video
wouldn't be such a big deal, right?

434
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,041
She never liked any of my videos

435
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,333
because she still…

436
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,291
Why are you laughing?

437
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,958
I'm not.

438
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,791
Why are you staring at me?

439
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:22,791
I'm not.

440
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,583
You got something to say?

441
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,666
No.

442
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,958
You wouldn't get it
because you've never dated.

443
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,250
How do you know that I've never dated?

444
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,583
I just do.

-Hey.
-I just want to talk to you.

465
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,208
Can you please stop calling me?

466

<i>Hey!</i>

469
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,541
Mom!

470
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,750
Why did you tell the teacher
that Zheng Yuxing was bothering me?

471
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,333
Didn't I already tell you that's not true?

472
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,208
I knew you didn't break up with him.

473
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,791
-Even so, is that any of your business?
-No.

474
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,541
Why is that any of my business?

475
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,208
You think the exam only concerns you?

476
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,708
If that's the case,

477
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,375
why would I live apart from your dad?

478
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,583
What am I doing here every day?

479
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,583
I cook, and you go to school.

480
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,666
Then I cook again
and wait for you to come back.

481
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,500
-I don't even have friends. You…
-I didn't ask you to stay here.

482
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,791
-So I'm not needed here.
-No.

483
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,416
You just said
that you don't want me here with you.

484
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,083
-But I just insist on staying here.
-No, that's not what I meant.

485
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,250
That's what you meant.

486
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,000
-I didn't mean it that way.
-You did!

487
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,291
-Can you tone it down?
-I can't!

488
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,541
You were dating.

489
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,041
You lied to me for a year.

490
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,666
Why do you all lie to me?

491
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,875
Am I such a terrible person?

492
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,916
I'm telling you, Chen Chen.

493
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,916
If you get back together
with Zheng Yuxing,

494
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,958
I'll leave right away.

495
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,083
-I will leave immediately.
-Go!

496
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,333
I don't need you!

497
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,250
I'll leave tomorrow!

498
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,166
What are you looking at?

499
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,791
Tang Chufei…

500
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,041
-Chen Chen.
-Chen Chen.

501
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,416
What happened?

502
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,416
-You know that, right?
-Hey.

503
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,916
-What are you doing?
-Zheng Yuxing, your ex is here.

504
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,250
I'm his current girlfriend.

505
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,583
-Current?
-Current?

506
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,833
-Is that true?
-Their seats are already separated.

507
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,041
This is too--

508
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,208
What are you doing?

509
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,666
Ms. Qu.

510
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:54,666
It created a buzz.

511
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,458
Almost everybody in the school knows.

512
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,666
So you're using me to provoke your mom?

513
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,541
But it's okay.

514
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,458
I don't mind.

515
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,000
-Come on.
-Wait.

516
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,666
It appears frequently in every part.

517
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,708
Wait.

518
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,250
Hello.

519
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,750
I'm eating in the canteen.

520
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,375
Why don't I…

521
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,500
Zheng Yuxing.

522
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,500
-Zheng Yuxing.
-What?

523
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,416
Zheng Yuxing.

524
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,458
What?

525
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,375
No way. I have to say that to your mom?

526
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,500
Yes, what's the matter? Any problems?

527
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,458
"Listen, your daughter and I
are together."

528
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:52,583
-No, I…
-I can't say it.

529
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,083
It's simple, let me finish.

530
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,166
Just insist that we won't break up.

531
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,458
No, I…

532
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,458
-Is that so hard?
-No way, I'm terrified of parents.

533
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,291
-I can't. It's spilling.
-No, put it down.

534
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,250
Put it down.

535
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,416
-Can't you just do me a favor?
-I can't.

536
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,625
-Why not?
-Chen Chen.

537
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:06,666
Your mom's here.

538
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,000
-No, I can't do it.
-Put it down first and sit down.

539
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,250
-You're done eating?
-Not yet.

540
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,541
-Hello, Mrs. Chen.
-Hello.

541
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:22,791
I'm Zheng Yuxing.

542
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,041
-Chen Chen, sit here.
-No.

543
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,833
-Listen to me.
-No, don't touch my food.

544
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,791
-Listen to me, sit here.
-Does it matter where I sit?

545
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:31,916
Why won't you sit here then?

546
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,250
Then why can't I sit here?

547
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,291
Do as I say. Sit here.

548
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,958
-Do as I say.
-Everyone's watching.

549
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,583
-Why are you touching my food?
-Do as I say.

550
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:38,541
Why don't I

551
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,666
sit over there?

552
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,416
Zheng Yuxing.

553
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,125
I heard that you're an Internet celebrity.

554
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,541
No.

555
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,583
Not quite.

556
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,875
I just recorded some videos.

557
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,541
They somehow went viral.

558
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,875
What do Internet celebrities do?

559
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,125
If you don't know, don't ask.

560
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:04,833
So?

561
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,500
Internet celebrities--

562
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,583
Look, this is my understanding.

563
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,833
Is it kind of like

564
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,083
starting a band in school

565
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,375
and playing rock and roll music
to get girls' attention?

566
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,916
Is it? I don't think so. That's not it.

567
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes, it is.

568
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,791
I was an Internet celebrity
when I was little too then.

569
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,583
I started a band
and was the main vocalist.

570
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,208
You don't believe me?

571
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,666
-I don't.
-I do.

572
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,208
You are quite handsome.

573
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:37,500
The type that girls Chen Chen's age dig.

574
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,916
Mom, what exactly do you want?

575
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,958
But that won't work
for more mature girls, handsome boy.

576
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,458
-Thank you, Mrs. Chen.
-Why are you thanking her?

577
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,666
She said that I'm handsome.

578
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,708
-You didn't hear the first part--
-I'm not finished.

579
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,916
I'm here today

580
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,958
to tell you both
the reason you didn't do well last year.

581
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,125
It's because you were dating,

582
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,708
then you broke up.

583
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,250
Can a breakup not affect your mood?

584
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,416
Chen Chen in particular

585
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,416
didn't do as well as she usually does.

586
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,458
Didn't you both come back to school

587
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,875
to get into a good college?

588
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,250
So take my advice.

589
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,791
-When dating--
-Mrs. Chen, actually it's not necessary.

590
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,333
-You can't break up.
-We won't--

591
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,791
You absolutely cannot break up this year.

592
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,083
This is so sour.

593
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,375
What were you doing?

594
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,458
What do you mean?

595
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,458
You went to school
and told us not to break up.

596
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,541
What do you want?

597
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,333
I've given this a lot of thought.

598
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,916
Zheng Yuxing got into the top class
with such bad grades.

599
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,458
He must be from a good family.

600
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,041
I have thought it through.

601
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,583
As a girl,

602
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,166
after going to a good college
and finding a good job,

603
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,750
you still need to marry well.

604
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,958
Not necessarily.

605
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,208
You're trying to goad me on.
You don't think I know that?

606
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,708
When I was young, your grandparents were

607
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,583
adamantly against
your dad and me being together

608
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,250
since he doesn't come from a good family.

609
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,833
The more they were against us,
the more I wanted to be with him.

610
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,166
And I ended up marrying him.

611
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,000
So you wouldn't have married him
if they were supportive?

612
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,291
I wouldn't go that far.

613
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,416
So

614
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,333
you like Dad after all.

615
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,375
Sweet, so sweet.

616
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,666
You two have been together
since high school?

617
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,541
And you're each other's first love.

618
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:26,000
Despite all obstacles,
you still stayed together until the end.

619
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,375
How nice.

620
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,291
That's why I've thought it through.

621
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,083
I don't want to stand in your way.

622
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,500
Didn't I tell Zheng Yuxing to persevere?

623
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,875
At least until the exam.

624
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,958
I don't mean to upset you.

625
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,166
Zheng Yuxing's grades are so bad.

626
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,375
It's hard for you two
to get into the same college.

627
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,708
You think it's so easy for two people

628
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,541
to end up together?

629
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,583
YONG'AN HIGH SCHOOL

630
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,083
The lighting here is great.

631
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,750
What on earth are you doing?

632
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,083
-Let's record a video, hurry.
-Record a video?

633
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,458
Come on.

634
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,375
Tell me what you're recording.

635
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,416
Hi, I want to make an announcement.

636
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,083
This is my girlfriend.

637
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,875
-We--
-Hey, "girlfriend"?

638
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,250
Aren't we just pretending
in front of my mom?

639
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,041
-Don't take it seriously. Is it off?
-You…

640
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,125
It's off.

641
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,208
-What are you doing?
-I know, I just…

642
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,958
I've lost some followers lately.

643
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,375
What does that have to do with me?

644
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:49,875
You…

645
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,125
Do you know what celebrities do
when they are no longer popular?

646
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,208
What?

647
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,375
They date.

648
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,375
They make relationship rumors.

649
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,333
You're using me?

650
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,458
How is it "using you"?

651
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,833
We each take what we need.

652
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,583
Or maybe,

653
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,458
you want her to see
that you have a new girlfriend,

654
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,250
so she'd think that you no longer care?

655
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,250
Yes.

656
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,291
Yes.

657
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,625
Yes, you're smart.
You're right about everything, okay?

658
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,291
Are we recording this or not?

659
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,958
-Come on, let's do it.
-Okay.

660
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:21,958
Yes, go.

661
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,583
Hi, let me introduce you.

662
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,083
I have an announcement today.

663
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,250
This is my girlfriend.

664
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:36,666
You…

665
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,583
Give a reaction.

666
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,541
Show some emotion.

667
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,125
Who behaves like this when dating?

668
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,958
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

669
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,250
Give them…

670
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:48,708
What?

671
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,458
Your hand is weird.

672
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,583
-This is better.
-No.

673
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,083
Don't move.

674
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,166
Put it there.

675
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,083
Let me do it.

676
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,041
Relax.

677
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,833
Smile.

678
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,375
Smile.

679
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:09,708
Smile.

680
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,666
Let me make an announcement.

681
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,541
This is my girlfriend.

682
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,625
Yes, we've recently made it official.

683
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,333
-Done.
-Smile again.

684
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:21,708
-Again?
-Smile.

685
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,291
A bigger smile. Come, one, two, three.

686
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,125
Okay, that's enough.

687
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,333
<i>Ms. Qu.</i>

688
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,291
<i>Those two in your class
badly influenced them.</i>

689
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,958
<i>Other classes
are beginning to imitate them too.</i>

690
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,708
<i>Ms. Yang, please ask them
to delete it right away.</i>

691
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,583
<i>We're doomed if the dean sees it.</i>

692
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,375
Good thing there's none from my class.

693

You think you're a celebrity?

706
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,875
You follow Zheng Yuxing's TikTok account?

707
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,208
You think I have nothing better to do?

708
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,083
It was sent in the parents' group chat.

709
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,208
The teacher was asking me about it.

710
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,416
What should I say?

711
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,250
Tell me. What's going on?

712
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,333
Well, he insisted on shooting that.
I couldn't stop him.

713
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,916
Can the two of you

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,833
behave like normal kids?

715
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:13,250
Keep it low-key if you're dating.
Why make it high-profile?

716
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,166
Coming to my school wasn't high-profile?

717
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,000
Fine, we'll work hard to be low-key, okay?

718
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,833
-I'll study hard.
-Come back.

719
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,083
-What?
-Sit down.

720
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,750
I'm not finished yet.

721
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,708
Don't you feel awkward?

722
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,208
Your relationship
should only concern the two of you.

723
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,458
Why let others know?

724
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,083
-You even posted it online.
-Yes.

725
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,291
-Are you showing off? Are you?
-Yes.

726
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,375
-Do you admit it? I think--
-Your phone.

727
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,291
-Zheng Yuxing is an Internet celebrity.
-Who's Hainan Fruit King?

728
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,416
Why are you looking at my phone?

729
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,708
Go to your room.

730
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,375
Hello?

731
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,416
Okay, I got it.

732
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,000
I have some errands.

733
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,208
-Sit down, didn't you have more to say?
-It's urgent.

734
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,916
Sit down, where are you going?

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,583
None of your business, go study.

736
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,416
Wait. Later--

737
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,333
Are you trying to scare me?

738
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,375
You won't let me contact you.

739
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,000
-I can only fly here to see you.
-You can't just come to my home.

740
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,583
What if my daughter sees you?

741
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,416
I had no other choice.

742
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,166
I called you and your phone was off.

743
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,875
I was on the flight when you called.

744
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,916
You never called me, so many…

745
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:36,708
Zheng Yuxing.

746
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,750
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

747
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,666
Hello, Mr. Chen.

748
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,375
-Why are you here?
-Hello.

749
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,791
I came to study with Chen Chen.

750
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:45,833
We've scheduled it.

751
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,500
Mr. Chen, I brought some fruits for you.

752
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,083
This is Zheng Yuxing,

753
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,416
Chen Chen's boyfriend.

754
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,333
Didn't they break up?

755
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,125
How do you know we broke up?

756
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,458
Why did you come down?

757
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:02,666
To pick up Zheng Yuxing.

758
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,625
Who are you?

759
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,916
-I--
-How rude. This is Uncle Wang,

760
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,291
an old classmate of mine.

761
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,916
-Yes.
-This is my daughter, Chen Chen.

762
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,875
-Wait, how do you know we broke up?
-Chen Chen.

763
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,500
We didn't break up.

764
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:14,541
Right?

765
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,708
It's good that you didn't break up.

766
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,958
Not breaking up is good.

767
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,666
-Why do you gossip about me to everybody?
-Zheng Yuxing.

768
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,458
Aren't you here to study with Chen Chen?

769
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,708
Here. Take these fruits from Zheng Yuxing.

770
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,166
We'll get going.

771
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,875
I guess I'll go. No need to send me off.

772
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:31,916
Bye.

773
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,708
Though I traveled a long distance,

774
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:37,583
there's really no need to send me off.

775
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,791
I'll send you off then.

776
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,416
-It was a long trip.
-No need.

777
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,041
I'll send Uncle Wang off.

778
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,666
You two go upstairs.

779
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,375
-Go.
-Okay.

780
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,083
It's getting late.

781
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,375
-Zheng Yuxing.
-Yes?

782
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,541
Go home after studying.

783
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,041
Okay.

784
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,791
Mom, come back soon.

785
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,333
Let's talk outside.

786
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,000
That was close.

787
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,708
What are you afraid of?

788
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,541
I thought he was your dad.

789
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,208
-Your mom obviously likes him.
-No way.

790
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,500
Why not?

791
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,833
Have a look at it yourself.

792
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,625
It's like they're confessing
their feelings to each other.

793
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,416
"I really love you.

794
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,791
Let's be together."

795
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,708
"This is a bit scandalous after all.

796
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,833
You shouldn't come to my house
no matter what!"

797
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,416
"Then where should we go?

798
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,250
Look. There's a hotel there."

799
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,916
-"We--"
-Cut the nonsense.

800
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,125
He's obviously bothering my mom.

801
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,166
Can't you see that she's rejecting him?

802
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,125
Okay.

803
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,041
Look.

804
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,458
"I'm begging you.
Add me on my WeChat, okay?

805
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,791
Add me on WeChat."

806
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,458
"I'm sorry, don't break my family apart.

807
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,708
Thank you."

808
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,750
Look.

809
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,166
Let's see.

810
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,583
Your mom took her phone out.

811
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,458
She scanned the code.

812
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,500
She was forced into it.

813
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,583
His phone was out, she had no choice.

814
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,625
Look, she's telling him to go.

815
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,083
{\an8}They kissed!

816
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,166
{\an8}He forced himself on her.

817
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,875
{\an8}Can't you see
my mom's reluctant expression?

818
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,458
This…

819
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,083
Your mom's smiling.

820
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,625
Forget it, I'm done.

821
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,791
Anyway, there's no way my mom likes him.

822
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,416
Fine.

823
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
You're not your mom, how would you know?

824
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,666
Don't you like that DJ?

825
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,708
You're so confident that she likes you?

826
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,500
-Are you sure?
-Of course. That…

827
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,250
You're not her, how do you know?

828
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,916
My parents have been together
ever since school.

829
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,041
And they're each other's first love.

830
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,208
I think this is how love should be.

831
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,041
They went through so much
and didn't part ways.

832
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,166
Nothing can break them up now.

833
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:03,625
What?

834
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,333
Nothing.

835
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,041
Is there something you want to say?

836
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,583
No.

837
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,791
Do you think that since I've never dated,
my opinion doesn't matter?

838
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,500
That's not what I think.

839
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,666
Let's study.

840
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,666
Come on.

841
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,291
<i>Actually, I didn't dare tell Chen Chen</i>

842
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,250
the reason I'm so sure Ming still likes me

843
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,625
is that I have no other choice.

844
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,125
It's a bit like

845
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:42,750
a type of faith

846
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:44,833
that keeps me going

847
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,416
until now.

848
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,416
If I stop believing it,

849
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,833
wouldn't everything we went through

850
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,500
be meaningless?

851
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,083
Does that make sense?

852
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,250
<i>What I think doesn't matter.</i>

853
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,375
<i>What matters is what you think.</i>

854
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,458
What a load of nonsense.

855
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,208
<i>Regarding that,</i>

856
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,916
<i>I have no comment.</i>

857
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,291
Forget it.

858
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,750
Play my favorite song.

859
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,666
<i>Okay, playing your personalized
radio station.</i>

860
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,458
Louder.

861
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,791
Turn it all the way up.

862
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,666
<i>It will be very loud, are you sure?</i>

863
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,041
I'm sure.

864
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,291
Hey.

865
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,625
I just wiped that.

866
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,875
The periodical exam results are out.

867
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,500
You should know how you did.

868
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,791
-Yes.
-Yes.

869
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,666
Change your seats in three minutes. Go.

870
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,750
-Hurry. Don't waste your time.
-Bye, buddy.

871
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,250
We will meet again.

872
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,625
Hurry.

873
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,541
Chen Chen.

874
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,166
Come back.

875
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:43,416
Sit down.

876
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,041
Didn't I tell you before?
Yours and Zheng Yuxing's seats are fixed.

877
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,458
Go outside, hurry.

878
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,375
Ms. Qu, I have a question.

879
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,333
What is it?

880
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,333
Well…

881
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,500
Why can't we choose our seats?

882
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,375
Chen Chen's mom said
that we can be together.

883
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,708
Quiet.

884
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,250
I don't care what her mom said.

885
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,458
My main responsibility is to make sure
your grades aren't affected.

886
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,125
Go, there's nothing to see.

887
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,041
Out.

888
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,666
Wait, Ms. Qu.

889
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,041
I have another question.

890
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,291
What is Chen Chen's rank this time?

891
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,125
She placed second again.

892
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:21,500
Everything's fine then.

893
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,166
Chen Chen's grades are steady.

894
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,958
It's clear that dating
has no impact on our grades.

895
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:29,708
-He's right.
-It's true.

896
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,333
But you're still in the last place.

897
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,541
Everything's fine then.

898
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,458
I've always been last,

899
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:35,875
so my grades are steady too.

900
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:39,375
And I never said
that dating can improve our grades.

901
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,625
I said it had no impact

902
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,958
on our grades.

903
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,208
-That's true.
-He's right.

904
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,416
Fine.

905
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,416
You stay where you are.

906
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,583
Maybe Chen Chen
won't want to sit with you.

907
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,000
Chen Chen.

908
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,333
Choose your seat.

909
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,666
What are you listening to?

910
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,625
What?

911
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,708
I said, what are you listening to?

912
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,625
Want to listen to it?

913
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,750
How is it? Nice, right?

914
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,875
What are you doing?

915
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:58,916
Put it back.

916
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,416
Keep listening, be patient.

917
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:56,833
Come in.

918
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,166
Wear these.

919
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,458
Where do we study?

920
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,083
What's the rush?

921
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,791
I'll show you around first.

922
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,208
Come.

923
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,166
That's my dad's room. This is mine.

924
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,625
What's this?

925
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:25,208
It's a mixer.

926
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,875
The turntables are on the left and right.

927
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,375
Mixers and turntables.

928
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,166
You're actually serious about music.

929
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,708
I always thought it was all just talk.

930
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,375
Of course. I'm very serious about it.

931
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,500
Why do you like electronic music?

932
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,791
Is it because of her?

933
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:46,958
Not entirely.

934
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,958
But back then,
I listened to more mainstream styles.

935
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,041
Only later did I discover
the genre I like.

936
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,125
How about I give you
a brief introduction to electronic music?

937
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,666
Electronic music is actually
a very broad concept.

938
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,833
If you were to thoroughly categorize

939
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,458
all the various styles,

940
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,250
there are over 80 that I know of.

941
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,791
Eighty?

942
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,208
-You've listened to them all?
-Yes.

943
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,000
-The more you listen to it,
-Fine.

944
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,000
the more you know what suits you,

945
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,666
and what kind of music

946
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,583
can bring comfort to your various moods.

947
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:15,500
Then…

948
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,791
Are you listening to me?

949
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:21,041
Sit over there.

950
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,166
I'll tell you about it.

951
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,750
Many of my favorite songs online
only have about a dozen comments.

952
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,458
There was even one song I love

953
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,250
that only had two comments.

954
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,958
That made me very curious.

955
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:36,625
Who are those two people?

956
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,041
And what are they like?

957
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,750
That is electronic music.

958
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,791
Very intimate,

959
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:42,708
but…

960
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,208
It can help you find kindred spirits.

961
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,500
Then…

962
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,791
What kind of electronic music
do you think suits me?

963
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,125
For you…

964
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,000
You…

965
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:59,166
-You--
-Forget it, let's go.

966
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,083
Let's study, Zheng Yuxing.

967
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,708
-Come on.
-Wait.

968
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,041
What?

969
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,666
Can you sing?

970
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:09,708
Everyone can sing.

971
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:10,958
I'm actually not bad.

972
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,083
Really?

973
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:13,875
Then come on.

974
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:14,916
Sing a song.

975
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,125
I'll accompany you.

976
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,833
Shouldn't we study?

977
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,333
-Hurry up. Sing a song.
-No, let's study.

978
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:22,666
If you don't sing, I won't go.

979
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:25,958
You can really play whatever I sing?

980
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,333
If you can sing it, I can play it.

981
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,125
What do you have in mind?

982
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,500
"Heroes' Song."

983
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,583
What is "Heroes' Song"?

984
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:38,958
It goes like

985
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,791
<i>Big river flowing to the east</i>

986
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,583
<i>The stars in the sky</i>

987
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,125
<i>-Follow the Big Dipper
-Follow the Big Dipper</i>

988
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:48,750
Sing another one.

989
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:50,666
I can't play that.

990
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,041
I really can't play that.
Who plays that song on a guitar?

991
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,541
-Pick another one.
-Who was that just now

992
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:59,041
who said,
"If you can sing it, I can play it."

993
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:01,333
Hurry, seriously.

994
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:03,416
I can't play that. Pick a normal song.

995
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,375
-A normal one?
-Yes.

996
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,208
Well…

997
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:09,916
How about Mayday's "Embrace"?

998
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,375
-Is that okay?
-That's fine.

999
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,833
-Really?
-Definitely. That's basic.

1000
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:13,833
A piece of cake.

1001
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,208
-Are you sure?
-I'll get ready.

1002
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,166
Definitely.

1003
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,583
Is this an amusement park?

1004
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,833
-This one.
-No.

1005
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:25,000
That's Europe's
largest electronic music festival.

1006
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,250
A place to find kindred spirits.

1007
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,541
It does look pretty interesting.

1008
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,708
Yes, we can go together some time.

1009
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,666
I'm ready, come on.

1010
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,750
Can you really do it?

1011
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,833
Yes, come on.

1012
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,333
Five, six, seven, eight.

1013
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,291
<i>Take…</i>

1014
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,750
Wait.

1015
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,708
You should have seen yourself just now.
You just…

1016
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,083
Five, six, seven, eight.

1017
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,666
Five, six, seven, eight.

1018
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,041
-<i>Take off…</i>
-I know.

1019
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,625
-Forget "five, six, seven, eight."
-Five, six…

1020
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:09,791
Let's do "one, two, three."

1021
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,166
-Okay, sure.
-One, two, three, go.

1022
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,958
-One, two, three, go.
-One, two, three.

1023
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:17,291
<i>Take off my mask after a long day</i>

1024
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,375
<i>Dash towards the boundary of my dreams</i>

1025
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,666
<i>-The pumpkin carriage</i>
-Sing it properly.

1026
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,375
<i>Change into the fairy tale glass slippers</i>

1027
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:33,958
<i>Let me enjoy this feeling</i>

1028
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:37,708
<i>I'm a proud and aloof rose</i>

1029
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,625
<i>Let me taste this flavor</i>

1030
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:45,750
<i>The mystery of this chaotic world</i>

1031
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:49,750
<i>Yesterday's too close
Tomorrow's too distant</i>

1032
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,958
<i>Quietly listen to the dark night</i>

1033
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,791
<i>-The evening breeze
-The evening breeze</i>

1034
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,750
-Kisses the lotus leaves
-Kisses the lotus leaves

1035
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:01,625
<i>Let me collapse drunk by the pond</i>

1036
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:05,708
<i>I'll wait for you
To clearly perceive my beauty</i>

1037
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:09,916
<i>The moonlight dries my tears</i>

1038
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,166
<i>That person</i>

1039
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,458
<i>Loves me</i>

1040
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:23,083
<i>He holds my hand</i>

1041
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,875
<i>Tightly</i>

1042
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,041
<i>Hugs me, kisses me</i>

1043
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:32,500
<i>Oh love</i>

1044
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,166
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

1045
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,916
I thought you were on a business trip.

1046
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,291
Mr. Zheng, I'm Zheng Yuxing's classmate.

1047
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:49,875
I came to study with him.

1048
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Let's go then.

1049
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,541
Let's study.

1050
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:12,500
Choose seats based on your rank.

1051
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,666
Ms. Qu, why is your class so happy today?

1052
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:32,458
Don't ask.

1053
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,583
All right, everybody. Time's up.

1054
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:37,333
Pass your tests forward.

1055
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,916
Zheng Yuxing, you didn't write your name.

1056
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,666
NAME: DJ XYZ

1057
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,125
What is that?

1058
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,625
Your name.

1059
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:54,625
It's my stage name.

1060
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,500
DJ XYZ.

1061
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,791
What does it mean?

1062
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,916
XYZ in reverse is ZYX,

1063
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,666
the initials for Zheng Yuxing.

1064
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,041
DJ XYZ.

1065
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,291
Right. Isn't your birthday coming up?

1066
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,375
I have a surprise for you.

1067
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,291
What is it?

1068
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,708
Isn't this place closed during the day?

1069
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:21,625
That's right.

1070
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:22,875
Li!

1071
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,375
Li!

1072
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,458
Li.

1073
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:31,708
What took you so long?

1074
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:32,916
Li.

1075
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,541
You always get me in trouble.

1076
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:35,458
Come in.

1077
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:36,375
Go.

1078
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,000
-Half an hour at most.
-Okay.

1079
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,458
Wait, I'm almost done.

1080
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,333
What on earth are you doing with that?

1081
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,041
Be patient, almost done.

1082
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,916
How long is "almost"?

1083
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,083
One minute.

1084
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,291
One minute?

1085
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,208
Okay.

1086
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,750
Fifty-nine.

1087
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,083
Fifty-eight.

1088
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,916
Fifty-seven.

1089
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,958
You've really never been to a club?

1090
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,625
-No.
-Really?

1091
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,208
What the heck?

1092
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:38,500
You've really never been to a club before?

1093
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,833
This is your surprise?

1094
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,125
This is actually my first time as a DJ.

1095
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,291
This is my favorite song.

1096
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:12,916
What do you think?

1097
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,541
Don't tell me you'll just play
one song for me.

1098
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,500
Enjoy yourself!

1099
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,250
Work with me here.

1100
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,291
Put your hands up.

1101
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,875
<i>That person</i>

1102
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,000
Higher.

1103
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:28,208
<i>That person</i>

1104
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:33,750
<i>That person</i>

1105
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,875
<i>Loves me</i>

1106
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:41,875
<i>He holds my hand</i>

1107
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,791
<i>Tightly</i>

1108
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,833
<i>Hugs me, kisses me</i>

1109
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:51,041
<i>Oh love, don't go</i>

1110
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:54,875
<i>Hugs me, kisses me</i>

1111
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:57,750
<i>Oh love</i>

1112
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,541
What do you think?

1113
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,416
It's all right.

1114
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,333
No, you…

1115
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:17,958
Just all right?

1116
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,666
It's awesome.

1117
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,666
I just made this mix.

1118
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,750
I sent it to you.

1119
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,833
You're the only person in the world
who has this song.

1120
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:33,541
Happy birthday.

1121
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,583
Thank you.

1122
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,166
Do you like it?

1123
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,375
I'm talking to you.

1124
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:50,583
<i>I'm back.</i>

1125
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,750
Dad!

1126
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,875
Why are you here?

1127
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,541
Of course I'm here
for my daughter's birthday.

1128
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,208
My birthday's tomorrow.

1129
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:04,416
It is. After midnight,
somebody is turning 18.

1130
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,458
Wash your hands, food's ready.

1131
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,750
You can blow the candles after midnight.

1132
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,000
Mom, I have to go out tonight.

1133
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,333
-What for?
-Zheng Yuxing.

1134
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,500
-What?
-Zheng Yuxing.

1135
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,083
-I'm meeting him.
-Why?

1136
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,000
Where are you going?

1137
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,875
She has a date with Zheng Yuxing.

1138
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,250
-I'll wash my hands.
-Didn't you two break up?

1139
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,000
They didn't, I'll explain it later.

1140
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,541
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

1141
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,458
Can't you reschedule?

1142
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:36,750
We set this a long time ago,
I can't cancel it now.

1143
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,458
You two can have
some quality time together.

1144
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,000
Have a good talk.

1145
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,375
She has plans, let her go.

1146
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:48,208
<i>-Happy birthday
-Happy birthday</i>

1147
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:52,875
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

1148
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,250
-Time to blow the candles.
-Great.

1149
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,333
-Wait.
-What is it?

1150
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,500
Make a wish first.

1151
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:59,208
-My birthday's tomorrow.
-Make a wish.

1152
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,291
Okay.

1153
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,250
Great!

1154
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,625
Let's eat the cake.

1155
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,541
-Here.
-I've wanted cake for so long.

1156
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:16,625
It's good.

1157
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,291
I'm going to get ready.

1158
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,375
I'll leave in a bit.

1159
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,583
Don't come back too late.

1160
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:29,750
Be safe.

1161
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:31,958
I know, bye.

1162
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,166
You really think we have

1163
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,666
to come back again at night?

1164
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,625
Is it really different at night?

1165
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,166
It's completely different at night.

1166
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,541
{\an8}You'll see.

1167
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:45,500
Come.

1168
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,125
Stop pushing.

1169
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,041
Where's Li?

1170
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,250
He's probably inside.

1171
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,833
Are the booths taken tonight?

1172
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,125
-Go inside.
-Li.

1173
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,666
Why are you here again?

1174
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,958
No wonder your grades suck.

1175
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,250
It's my girlfriend's birthday today,
so I brought her here.

1176
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,750
Girlfriend?

1177
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,833
You're just scared of seeing someone,

1178
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:42,125
so you dragged her here as your shield.

1179
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:44,000
But you might be disappointed today.

1180
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,125
Ming isn't here.

1181
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:46,333
She's not coming?

1182
01:07:46,416 --> 01:07:47,458
No, she's not.

1183
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,708
Her flight got delayed.
She went straight to Sanya.

1184
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,166
Xiamen is just a warm-up.

1185
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,916
Sanya's New Year is the main event.

1186
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,083
Don't push.

1187
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,625
Are you coming in or not?

1188
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,125
Those at the back, show me your tickets.

1189
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,083
Wait.

1190
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:01,625
Miss, how old are you?

1191
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,583
Eighteen.

1192
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,916
-She's an adult.
-Is she 18?

1193
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,583
Show me your ID.

1194
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,875
-She didn't bring it.
-Not you.

1195
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,125
Stand aside.

1196
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,250
-Your ID.
-Okay.

1197
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,208
Come on.

1198
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,083
Let's see.

1199
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,125
How is she 18? She turns 18 tomorrow.

1200
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:18,291
It's her birthday today.

1201
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,208
She's celebrating today,
but she's 18 tomorrow.

1202
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,625
-She's celebrating it today.
-This…

1203
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:23,041
That won't fly.

1204
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,541
She's short by an hour.

1205
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,958
You two can go in after midnight.

1206
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,458
-Make an exception.
-Go, wait on the side.

1207
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,708
-No, wait on the side.
-What difference is a few minutes?

1208
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,625
It's almost your birthday.

1209
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,541
How does being an adult feel?

1210
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,000
Is the Ming he mentioned just now

1211
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,916
the DJ you were talking about?

1212
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,375
We're mainly here
to celebrate your birthday.

1213
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:19,000
If you don't want to go in,
we can have supper.

1214
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:25,250
Forget it.

1215
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,208
We're already here.

1216
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,166
It's almost time.

1217
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,250
Let's check this out.

1218
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,000
Li.

1219
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,208
Stand properly.

1220
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,583
Three,

1221
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,708
two, one.

1222
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:47,125
Happy birthday!

1223
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,125
Okay.

1224
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,083
Here.

1225
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,583
For you two.

1226
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,125
Extend your hand.

1227
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,250
-All right, have fun.
-Thank you.

1228
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:55,375
Let's go.

1229
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:04,625
Stay close.

1230
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:27,416
Excuse me.

1231
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,041
Excuse me, don't stand here.

1232
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,291
Chen Chen!

1233
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,125
Chen Chen!

1234
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:23,458
I've been looking for you.

1235
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,791
Why are you here?

1236
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,625
I saw you walk that way.
I couldn't find you, so I just sat here.

1237
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,333
Why do you like this place?

1238
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,458
Don't you think it's too loud?

1239
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,458
Isn't that great?

1240
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,458
The louder, the better.

1241
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,958
The volume can drown out your worries.

1242
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,958
Want to go to the front?

1243
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,333
Let's go.

1244
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,291
Excuse me.

1245
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,041
Excuse me.

1246
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,500
Do you know what it feels like up there?

1247
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,375
Think about it.

1248
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,250
Imagine that you're a DJ now,

1249
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:42,416
and you make this place go wild.

1250
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,625
The songs you play make everybody
happy and excited.

1251
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,625
I want to be up there one day.

1252
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,375
Let's go to the back,
it's too crowded here.

1253
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,583
Chen Chen.

1254
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:23,375
Chen Chen.

1255
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,458
Chen Chen!

1256
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,333
Chen Chen!

1257
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,583
-Where are you going?
-I'm fine, just a bit tired.

1258
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:37,500
I'm going home.

1259
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,416
As for what happened earlier,
I apologize, okay?

1260
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,458
I just had a breakup.

1261
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,416
I'm not ready.

1262
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,708
-And I--
-Was that a breakup?

1263
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,375
You got dumped.

1264
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,541
How is that any of your business?

1265
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,083
It's none of my business.

1266
01:13:55,791 --> 01:13:58,625
Then why did you insist
on bringing me here to be with you?

1267
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,041
We're celebrating your birthday.

1268
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,333
You just wanted to use me.

1269
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:04,500
For what?

1270
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,708
You brought me here to make her jealous.

1271
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,833
You thought you could win her back.

1272
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,291
If you really like her,

1273
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:11,916
get her back.

1274
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,625
If she doesn't like you anymore,
you must learn to accept it, okay?

1275
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:15,833
How do you know that?

1276
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,416
You really don't know?

1277
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,041
Can't you face the truth?

1278
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,250
Who do you think you are?

1279
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,166
Are you really so brave?

1280
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:25,208
If you are, why tell lies?

1281
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,791
Why tell others that we're together?

1282
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:31,250
Your mom is having an affair.
Why don't you confront her?

1283
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,416
If you have the guts, expose her.

1284
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:42,625
Don't go.

1285
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,416
I'm sorry.

1286
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:53,875
Do you know?

1287
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:55,833
You're really childish.

1288
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,333
No wonder she dumped you.

1289
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,708
-Have you ever cared for her?
-Of course.

1290
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:42,875
She's my daughter, I have to.

1291
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:44,041
-What did you do?
-I care greatly about her.

1292
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,625
I'm under a lot of pressure.

1293
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,958
-Do you know that?
-Don't keep telling me that.

1294
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,333
I have to act in front of her
every day, you know.

1295
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,750
I'm already in a tough spot.

1296
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:53,291
I'm acting too.

1297
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:54,541
I'm doing the same.

1298
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,083
I don't want to talk anymore.
Can you understand me?

1299
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:00,666
Waiter.

1300
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:02,666
Waiter!

1301
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,458
-Another glass of wine.
-Okay.

1302
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,958
MING, ARE YOU AWAKE?

1303
01:16:55,041 --> 01:17:00,000
THE MESSAGE WAS SENT
BUT REJECTED BY THE RECEIVER.

1304
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,500
<i>The subscriber you dialed
cannot be reached.</i>

1305
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,125
<i>Please try again later. Sorry…</i>

1306
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,541
<i>The subscriber you dialed
can't be reached.</i>

1307
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,291
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1308
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,083
<i>Hello?</i>

1309
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,416
<i>Hello?</i>

1310
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,583
<i>Keep your voices down. I can't hear.</i>

1311
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:50,291
<i>Ming, it's for you.
Somebody's looking for you.</i>

1312
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:53,666
It's…

1313
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,833
It's me.

1314
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,250
If your parents don't get along,

1315
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,291
and they're seeing other people now,

1316
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,875
isn't that a good thing?

1317
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:20,625
Why can't you accept that?

1318
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,708
If the person you love

1319
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,958
has a new life now,

1320
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,416
can you accept that?

1321
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,083
See?

1322
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,250
When it comes to others,

1323
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,000
everything seems simple.

1324
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,791
But what if it's about ourselves?

1325
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:47,541
I can't accept it.

1326
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,625
I can't accept it either.

1327
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,708
If so, then go tell them.

1328
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:53,958
What should I say?

1329
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:56,541
Can I actually stop them

1330
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,541
from living their new lives?

1331
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:00,791
Can I?

1332
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:05,875
Right.

1333
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:08,083
A lot of times, we understand

1334
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,625
that we're being childish,

1335
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,250
but we can't help ourselves.

1336
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,291
No.

1337
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,833
I can't do it,

1338
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,750
but you can.

1339
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
After all, you were together before.

1340
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,375
Even if you broke up,

1341
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,416
she owes you an explanation.

1342
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,416
-But--
-But what?

1343
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,916
Did I say anything wrong?

1344
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,875
Tell me.

1345
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,916
After midnight, can I still make a wish?

1346
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,416
Will it come true?

1347
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,291
Yes.

1348
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:54,958
Definitely.

1349
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,458
Give me your hand.

1350
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:06,875
I wish

1351
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,500
that we

1352
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,666
can face ourselves more honestly,

1353
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:17,583
and we

1354
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,416
can become braver.

1355
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,666
Everything I said…

1356
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,916
outside the club was out of anger.

1357
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,875
Actually…

1358
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:00,916
Actually, I…

1359
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,625
I was just jealous.

1360
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,083
See?

1361
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:13,333
Being honest isn't so hard, right?

1362
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,625
Zheng Yuxing.

1363
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:23,125
I'll go to see her with you.

1364
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,208
{\an8}<i>So,</i>

1365
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,375
{\an8}<i>we've decided</i>

1366
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,125
{\an8}<i>to take</i>

1367
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:34,833
{\an8}<i>a completely spontaneous trip.</i>

1368
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,625
{\an8}<i>Have a nice life, everyone.</i>

1369
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,166
Let's go.

1370
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,750
Hurry, the car is here.

1371
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,791
{\an8}AND A FISH: GOODNESS! YOU LEFT HOME?
BUY IT!: WHERE ARE YOU?

1372
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:01,333
{\an8}KIVI: WHAT'S GOING ON?
_CRAZYHIHI_: ARE YOU BOTH ELOPING?

1373
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:03,833
{\an8}MR. FEI: CONGRATULATIONS
FROM YOUR CLASSMATE

1374
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,583
Come on.

1375
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,666
{\an8}<i>Everybody, take a guess where we are.</i>

1376
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,833
{\an8}<i>Chen Chen.</i>

1377
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,208
{\an8}<i>Shout it out to everybody.</i>

1378
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,708
{\an8}<i>Where are we?</i>

1379
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,250
{\an8}<i>We are at…</i>

1380
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:30,625
{\an8}<i>I'm not going to tell you.</i>

1381
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,791
{\an8}<i>Turn it off.</i>

1382
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:34,000
-Is it off?
-Yes.

1383
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:34,916
Let's go.

1384
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:36,541
-Go!
-Go!

1385
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,208
Did Zheng Yuxing and Chen Chen elope?

1386
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,458
-What?
-They eloped?

1387
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:40,416
-Hurry.
-Come.

1388
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,083
-Come and look at Zheng Yuxing's TikTok.
-Really?

1389
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:56,833
Hey, Ms. Qu.

1390
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:58,375
<i>Mrs. Chen.</i>

1391
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,166
<i>Can you and your husband come to school?</i>

1392
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,500
Isn't it the weekend? What's the matter?

1393
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:06,083
<i>Are you aware that Chen Chen
and Zheng Yuxing have taken a trip?</i>

1394
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,000
Where did they go?

1395
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,750
<i>We're finally here.</i>

1396
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,166
{\an8}This is Zheng Yuxing?

1397
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,583
He's quite handsome.

1398
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,291
Look. This video has over 10,000 likes.

1399
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:29,375
He's quite popular.

1400
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:31,666
Hey.

1401
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,333
What kind of mom are you?

1402
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:34,958
I told you not to drink, you insisted.

1403
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,833
You don't even know
that she didn't come home.

1404
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:37,958
Didn't you drink too?

1405
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,166
I thought she was already home.

1406
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,375
I only found out in the morning.

1407
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,583
Her phone is off too.

1408
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:44,916
<i>We're here.</i>

1409
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,541
<i>We're headed to the hotel.</i>

1410
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:49,333
<i>Everybody, take a guess where we are.</i>

1411
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,375
<i>Chen Chen.</i>

1412
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,125
{\an8}<i>-Shout it out to everybody.</i>
-Where are they?

1413
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,416
{\an8}<i>We are at…</i>

1414
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,166
{\an8}<i>I'm not going to tell you.</i>

1415
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,250
<i>Turn it off.</i>

1416
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,791
Are they getting a room?
What if she gets taken advantage of?

1417
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,333
Mr. Chen, don't worry.

1418
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:02,416
You're overthinking.
They won't do anything.

1419
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
Your child is a boy,
of course you're not worried.

1420
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:06,458
-Ours is a girl.
-My son won't do anything

1421
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:08,500
to your daughter.

1422
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:10,916
Don't you think
that's irresponsible for you to say?

1423
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,125
What do you mean?

1424
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:13,916
-Ms. Qu.
-Ms. Qu.

1425
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:23,000
We called you here this weekend
to figure out how this should be handled.

1426
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:26,083
The principal just called and said
they could face disciplinary action.

1427
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,833
Ms. Qu, that can't be.

1428
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:30,000
It's the weekend.
They're not skipping school.

1429
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,708
-Right.
-Look at the number of hits.

1430
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:33,791
Everybody online is talking about them.

1431
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,791
Other parents
have already brought this up.

1432
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,333
If it keeps escalating
and relevant units get involved,

1433
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,750
the consequences are unimaginable.

1434
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:42,125
The principal wants us
to bring them back now.

1435
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:44,625
We can't allow their posts
to get out of hand.

1436
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,500
Otherwise, they could be expelled.

1437
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,291
I'll call her.

1438
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:49,708
Come on. Didn't I just say it?

1439
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,875
-It's been off since morning.
-What should we do then?

1440
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,625
-Can you think of something?
-All right.

1441
01:25:56,833 --> 01:25:57,750
What if

1442
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:59,375
I check

1443
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:02,416
Zheng Yuxing's credit card records?

1444
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,916
Aren't you being too impulsive?

1445
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,291
Wasn't this your idea?

1446
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,000
Come on!

1447
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,958
{\an8}SPECIAL PERFORMANCE
FOR ELECTRONIC LOVERS

1448
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:19,166
{\an8}COME AND JOIN US

1449
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:25,250
Ming looks cool!

1450
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,583
Now, you owe me a secret.

1451
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:01,833
I just confirmed with the hotel

1452
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,250
that they're staying here.

1453
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:04,375
Slow down.

1454
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,875
There's a music festival near the hotel.

1455
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:10,041
I think that's probably
why they came to Sanya.

1456
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,208
This way.

1457
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,250
They shut the lights down.

1458
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:06,125
The next DJ is coming.

1459
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:09,666
{\an8}LOADING

1460
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,125
Want to go to the front?

1461
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,125
There's no need.

1462
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:15,250
I don't want to see Ming anymore.

1463
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:21,041
I couldn't let go

1464
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:25,291
wasn't because

1465
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:27,958
Ming owes me an explanation,

1466
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:30,958
but because I couldn't accept

1467
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:33,125
the fact that I still like her,

1468
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:37,166
but she no longer likes me.

1469
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,458
But from now on,

1470
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:43,041
I'll try hard to accept that.

1471
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:41,666
In the future,

1472
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,333
if the people we like

1473
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:47,875
can also like us,

1474
01:32:51,083 --> 01:32:52,500
how nice would that be?

1475
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,416
Zheng Yuxing.

1476
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:31,875
Let me tell you a secret.

1477
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:40,625
You asked me before
if I have a crush on you.

1478
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:43,083
Actually, you were right.

1479
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:47,208
I've liked you since junior year.

1480
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,416
I wish I could also like you back.

1481
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:58,708
Or maybe

1482
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:02,833
we should both learn to accept

1483
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,250
that the one we like
might not like us back.

1484
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,875
WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER
AFTER THE EXAM?

1485
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,666
ARE WE GOING WITH THE DIVORCE
AGREEMENT THREE YEARS AGO?

1486
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,916
WILL SHE LIVE WITH YOU?

1487
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,083
SHE'S ALMOST 18,
SHALL WE LET HER DECIDE?

1488
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:46,416
STANDARD EXAM CLOCK

1489
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:02,125
<i>Who was it? Who was your boyfriend?</i>

1490
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,166
His name is Zheng Yuxing.

1491
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,416
Out of all the guys in school, why me?

1492
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,875
You have a crush on me, don't you?

1493
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:31,958
{\an8}<i>Hi.</i>

1494
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:51,625
No matter what happens in the future,

1495
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,083
we know.

1496
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,583
You understand, don't you?

1497
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,041
Rest over there.

1498
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:04,125
They are already in this situation.

1499
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,541
Let's just sign it.

1500
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:06,541
Any misunderstandings?

1501
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:08,916
Yes. I'm sorry.

1502
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,208
Sorry to trouble you.

1503
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,333
I will deal
with their education after this.

1504
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,250
Zheng Yuxing.

1505
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,291
Are you okay?

1506
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,708
I'll get her.

1507
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,333
Chen Chen, come here for a second.

1508
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:41,125
I, ZHENG YUXING,
HAVE BEEN HARASSING CHEN CHEN

1509
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:42,750
SINCE THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

1510
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:44,833
I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT
THE SCHOOL'S PUNISHMENT.

1511
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:47,708
Why do I need to sign this?

1512
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:51,250
It's what Zheng Yuxing's dad wants.

1513
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,000
He will make Zheng Yuxing say

1514
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:54,958
that he singlehandedly planned this.

1515
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:57,083
He also forced you to shoot

1516
01:39:57,166 --> 01:39:59,041
all the videos posted online.

1517
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:01,541
Be good.

1518
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:02,666
Sign it.

1519
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,000
Nothing written here is true.

1520
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,166
I'm the one who wanted to come.

1521
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,000
I'm not signing this.

1522
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:15,291
Do you think there's a point
in saying that now?

1523
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:18,000
You two made a big mess.

1524
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:19,916
The school can't tolerate it.

1525
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
What will they do?

1526
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,000
Expel you both?

1527
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,375
So you want us to lie?

1528
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,583
We are not making you lie.

1529
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:26,666
-Didn't I just tell you?
-What about Zheng Yuxing?

1530
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:29,041
What will happen to him?
What does "punishment" here mean?

1531
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,000
Expulsion?

1532
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:32,208
Will he get expelled?

1533
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:34,583
It doesn't matter if he gets expelled.

1534
01:40:34,666 --> 01:40:35,958
His family can afford it.

1535
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:37,708
They can send him abroad for school.

1536
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:39,041
Can we afford that?

1537
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,541
What if you got expelled?

1538
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,500
It doesn't matter either.

1539
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:43,958
I'll do what I should do.

1540
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:46,291
I'll stop school. I can quit school too.

1541
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:57,791
Chen Chen,
you think I don't understand you?

1542
01:40:58,416 --> 01:40:59,250
No.

1543
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:02,375
You've been with Zheng Yuxing
for such a long time.

1544
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:03,708
You like him.

1545
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,375
But think about it.

1546
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:07,541
Zheng Yuxing
is taking responsibility for this

1547
01:41:07,625 --> 01:41:09,500
because he likes you too, doesn't he?

1548
01:41:09,583 --> 01:41:12,625
He's not obligated to help me.

1549
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:14,041
How is he not?

1550
01:41:14,125 --> 01:41:15,541
We're not dating.

1551
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:17,875
I just met him this semester.

1552
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:19,375
It was all a lie, you know?

1553
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:21,041
Everything is a lie.

1554
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,833
What is the truth?

1555
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,750
Did you speak any truth?

1556
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,583
You…

1557
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:38,416
Why are you doing this to me?

1558
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,125
You want the truth?

1559
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:45,916
-No, nothing you say is real.
-The truth is I found out last year

1560
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,083
that you and Dad
have been divorced for a long time.

1561
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,708
The truth is I know

1562
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:53,291
that you're dating Uncle Wang.

1563
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:54,916
I know Dad is with someone else.

1564
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:58,583
You didn't want to tell me
about the divorce

1565
01:41:58,666 --> 01:42:00,666
because you thought
it would affect my exam.

1566
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,125
I failed the exam on purpose.

1567
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,375
Actually, I finished answering everything.

1568
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,916
But I erased them all in the end.

1569
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:17,833
I just thought

1570
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:23,666
that if I had one more year,
would you guys get back together?

1571
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:30,458
I just don't want

1572
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:35,083
to pick between the two of you.

1573
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:50,666
Mom.

1574
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,791
I don't want you and Dad

1575
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:58,333
to lie for my sake anymore.

1576
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:03,416
I don't want Zheng Yuxing to lie either.

1577
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:54,458
We're not signing this.

1578
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:55,958
If she gets expelled, so be it.

1579
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:58,291
How can she get expelled?

1580
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:00,708
What are you doing?

1581
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:02,708
Let's talk when we get home.

1582
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,083
Zheng Yuxing.

1583
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:11,291
How are you doing?

1584
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:16,083
What's wrong with you?

1585
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,666
Zheng Yuxing.

1586
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:20,166
Chen Chen.

1587
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:23,708
I think

1588
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:26,791
I've lost the hearing in my left ear.

1589
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,583
Mom!

1590
01:44:33,666 --> 01:44:34,500
Mom!

1591
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,333
{\an8}YONG'AN HIGH SCHOOL

1592
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:05,750
Take your phones out.

1593
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:08,750
Pass them to the middle.

1594
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:09,666
Hurry!

1595
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:13,208
-How can you do this?
-What's happening?

1596
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:15,083
-Starting today…
-Ms. Qu, what if we…

1597
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:16,750
Quiet.

1598
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:19,541
Starting today, turn in your phones
before your morning self-study.

1599
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:21,791
The class monitor
will bring them to the office.

1600
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:24,166
We'll return them to you in the evening.

1601
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,166
Also, Chen Chen and Zheng Yuxing

1602
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:28,416
have decided to drop out.

1603
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:31,458
Do not repost their videos.

1604
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:32,833
Do not discuss them either.

1605
01:45:32,916 --> 01:45:35,708
Don't let me find out
that you have other phones.

1606
01:45:35,791 --> 01:45:37,541
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

1607
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:40,625
Do you know
what's most important to you right now?

1608
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:42,291
-The college entrance exam.
-Do you--

1609
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,375
Go to college.

1610
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,333
-Studies.
-Study hard.

1611

1618
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:52,708
IF N EQUALS X, Y, Z IS…

1619
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:13,541
Do you want to come home
for a few days after Sanya?

1620
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:15,583
It's okay.

1621
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:17,583
I'll fly back from there.

1622
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:19,375
Okay.

1623
01:47:26,833 --> 01:47:28,166
How's my mom lately?

1624
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:30,208
She complains to me every day.

1625
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:31,750
She says

1626
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:33,333
that it's too hot in Hainan,

1627
01:47:33,416 --> 01:47:35,083
and the food isn't good.

1628
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,250
That's how

1629
01:47:40,333 --> 01:47:41,750
your mom is.

1630
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:43,416
She doesn't say what she thinks.

1631
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:45,875
The more she likes something,

1632
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,833
the more she complains about it.

1633
01:47:47,916 --> 01:47:48,958
Usually,

1634
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:51,125
she's really happy here.
