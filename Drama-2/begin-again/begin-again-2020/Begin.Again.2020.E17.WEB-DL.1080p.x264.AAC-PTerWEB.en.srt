00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,239
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,489
I didn't expect Doctor Ling

5
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:44,730
to get married so early.

6
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,690
Yes

7
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,850
I always thought

8
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,770
he will be together with

9
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,090
the Medical University Talented Girl.

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,340
Medical University Talented Girl?

11
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,570
Who's that?

12
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,090
Fangning, you didn't know,

13
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,380
when I first entered the medical college

14
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,220
I heard many things

15
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,130
about Dr. Ling's Deeds.

16
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,770
It can be said

17
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,690
Doctor Ling is the

18
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,170
idol of all of us.

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,810
As for this Talented Girl

20
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,000
Yu Shiyi.

21
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,330
She's the White Moonlight

22
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,050
in our hearts.

23
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,340
What do you mean?

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,730
Everyone was there every night

25
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,660
to watch the moonlight.

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,930
But this White Moonlight

27
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,610
only follows Dr. Ling.

28
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,900
I heard that the two of them

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,929
could stay in the library all day.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,970
Or in the laboratory.

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,850
And

32
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,930
they even conducted an autopsy on the same corpse.

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,330
You talk too much.

34
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,650
It's okay, go on.

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,529
Well, Fangning.

36
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,170
It's like this.

37
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,380
This is just a rumor in the university.

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,460
Like every other school

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,610
has its top ten singers.

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,850
You don't have to worry about it.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,050
It's okay.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,210
I know all these.

43
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,760
Aren't these all in the past?

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,580
Yeah.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,890
When we were young.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,900
In the past.

47
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,960
Don't mention it.

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,250
What are you guys talking about?

49
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,529
You guys look happy.

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,460
About your ex-girlfriend.

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,050
Ex-girlfriend?

52
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,290
That one.

53
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:56,250
Yu…

54
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,520
Yu Shiyi.

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,730
Shut up.

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,400
Are you and that Ms. Yu

57
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,080
still in contact now?

58
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,010
She's studying in Germany.

59
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,170
We email each other occasionally

60
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,450
about our research progress.

61
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,370
You okay?

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,730
Fangning.

63
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,930
What happened?

64
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,770
It's all your fault.

65
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,690
Hello, Mr. Lu.

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,690
Hello.

67
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,650
The works of more than 30 artists are on display today.

68
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,330
These are Nordic paintings.

69
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,730
There are quite a few

70
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,650
are from some famous collectors

71
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,810
who put the art on display for the first time.

72
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,130
Mr. Lu,

73
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,210
I trust you will love them.

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,650
Hope you can pick

75
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,450
something you like.

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,770
Thank you.

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,050
Well, Mr. Lu.

78
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,290
And your secretary.

79
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,260
Please Enjoy.

80
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,730
I shall excuse myself.

81
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,930
What the heck.

82
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,860
How did I become your secretary?

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,130
Don't mind him.

84
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,850
He was just talking casually.

85
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,810
I'm obviously your girlfriend.

86
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,690
This painting is not bad.

87
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,480
This one is not bad, too.

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
What do you think?

89
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,320
Are you okay?

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,240
Director Lu, today is the weekend.

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Your miss secretary

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
is getting off work.

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Are you angry?

94
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Not really.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Today we are not in the company.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
I want to experience

97
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,720
how it feels to be a girlfriend.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,950
Okay.

99
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,920
Then I will explain to them.

100
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,030
Well.

101
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,200
You don't have to do it on purpose.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Come on, smile a little.

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
Look at your face.

104
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,550
If others see it they will think

105
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,640
you are my bodyguard.

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm kidding,

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,000
don't take it seriously.

108
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,440
How about this?

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
All the paintings here.

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
Which one do you like?

111
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll buy it for you.

112
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
For who?

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
Your secretary or your bodyguard?

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,200
Excuse me, Mr. Lu.

115
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,830
There is a reporter over there.

116
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,080
They want to interview you

117
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,400
about today's exhibition.

118
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay.

119
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,320
I'll go first then.

120
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,520
Wait for me.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
Miss, this way please.

122
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,470
Currently,

123
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,640
this is the one

124
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,840
with the highest bid.

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,710
Director Lu wants this one, then.

126
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,920
Also,

127
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,440
please double the bid.

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
Okay, no problem,

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,430
I will handle it.

130
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,150
Thank you.

131
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,800
I will buy it.

132
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,280
And give it to my bodyguard.

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Bodyguard.

134
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Welcome back babies

135
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,430
to my channel.

136
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,600
Today I am honored

137
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,680
to have received an invitation

138
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,030
from a Nordic painter

139
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,200
to see his exhibition.

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm so excited.

141
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Really.

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
I can't describe it in words.

143
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,910
Now,

144
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,550
I will take everyone

145
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,840
to have a good look

146
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
at this exhibition.

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
Come, shoot over here.

148
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,550
Get my good angles.

149
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
You must capture my

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,920
noble and elegant temperament.

151
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll buy you a chicken drumstick tonight.

152
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Sorry.

153
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
-It's you?
-It's you?

154
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,520
The paparazzi at Lu Fangning's wedding?

155
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Ruining someone else's wedding…

156
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,200
You can't say that.

157
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
Looking at paintings?

158
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,240
Do you even understand them?

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,960
You…

160
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,790
How about you, you minx?

161
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,000
You paparazzi wench!

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,470
Jerk!

163
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,080
Small fry reporter!

164
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,000
A woman who only knows how to stomp her foot!

165
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
Whether you understand the paintings or not

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,670
you can't have them.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,350
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,440
This painting is already mine.

169
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,960
How is this possible?

170
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,270
This painting,

171
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,550
is it bidden?

172
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,400
This painting,

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Mr. Lu just bought it.

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Mr. Lu?

175
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Which Mr. Lu?

176
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,200
Mr. Lu Yiyao.

177
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,520
Lu Yiyao?

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

179
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,760
What does Lu Yiyao have to do with you?

180
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,830
He asked me to choose one.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
This painting

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,470
is what he bought for me.

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,320
Excuse me.

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,750
Are you kidding me?

185
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,840
How could Lu Yiyao

186
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
spend this money for you?

187
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
I know.

188
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,080
Must be because of your

189
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,790
relationship with Lu Fangning.

190
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,920
So he…

191
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,710
He did this just to make me happy.

192
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Gosh.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
Are you dreaming?

194
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
How could Lu Yiyao

195
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,760
fancy you?

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Look at yourself.

197
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
Do you know who is Lu Yiyao's

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,160
ex-girlfriend

199
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
and fiancee?

200
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
Are the people of the Lu family blind?

201
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,550
You are so ordinary.

202
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,000
How could he fall in love with you?

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,680
Lu Yiyao's taste

204
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,119
can't drop this much.

205
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,800
So you must be dreaming.

206
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
Miss Tang.

207
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
Please don't harass

208
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,800
my girlfriend.

209
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,840
Girl…

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,920
First of all,

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,910
My taste

212
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,680
I think.

213
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,990
Has nothing to do with you.

214
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,600
Secondly,

215
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,080
Miss Cai Siyu next to me,

216
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,560
She is no worse

217
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
than any of my exes.

218
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Her good features

219
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,920
I don't think I need to

220
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,710
or am obligated to let you know.

221
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,360
In addition,

222
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
the way you wear a wedding dress

223
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
is really ugly.

224
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,440
You…

225
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Let's go.

226
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,960
Stop shooting. Why are you shooting?

227
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,320
Why shoot him? Shoot me!

228
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,760
Shoot me, idiot!

229
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,560
What are you looking at?

230
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
There's nothing to see here.

231
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
Break up.

232
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,200
Shameful.

233
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:06,490
[Castfast Hotel]

234
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,910
I drank a little too much.

235
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,840
Thank you for the treat, Fangning.

236
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,990
I didn't.

237
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,400
Who did then?

238
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,040
It's the same if I did or she did.

239
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,720
Yeah, it's the same.

240
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,200
Hey, Fangning.

241
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,080
You seem like you have indigestion.

242
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
Should we go

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,670
help with your digestion?

244
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,750
Disco?

245
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,640
Let's go!

246
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,560
Well, then we will…

247
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,640
Oh, to the disco?

248
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,590
Why do you only think of disco

249
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,280
whenever we go out?

250
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
How does karaoke sound?

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
Professor Luo, you…

252
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,640
Then you young people go and play.

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,990
It's too loud there.

254
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,670
My heart can't stand it.

255
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,240
You guys have fun.

256
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
Goodbye, Professor.

257
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,670
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

258
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,440
Goodbye, Professor Luo.

259
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,480
Goodbye.

260
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,640
It's my treat.

261
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Let's go.

262
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,120
Then let's go first.

263
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,560
We are going.

264
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,280
Goodbye.

265
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,270
If you don't want to go.

266
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,160
Then we…

267
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,360
You don't want to go, right?

268
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,470
If you don't want to go

269
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,560
I'll go.

270
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,840
Okay, now that we are all here.

271
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,920
First of all, please welcome our

272
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
Flower Couple

273
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
to sing a song, "I love You So Much".

274
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,070
Welcome.

275
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,440
Come come.

276
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Come, Dr. Ling.

277
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,680
Don't be shy and go.

278
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,430
Yes.

279
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,160
Come on.

280
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,120
If you don't want to sing

281
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
we can say no.

282
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
I want to sing.

283
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,960
But I don't know how to sing this song.

284
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,520
Don't tell me at this age

285
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,800
you have never been to karaoke.

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,270
I came once,

287
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,360
back in college.

288
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,520
Just once.

289
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,680
Was it with that

290
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
Dr. Yu.

291
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,880
Yes.

292
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't want to sing.

293
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
If they don't want to sing.

294
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
Let's sing this.

295
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,120
Okay.

296
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
-Let's sing this.
-What's the matter?

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,780
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

298
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,920
In my heart.

299
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
The heart is on the left.

300
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,080
Is it because I can't sing the song you want to sing?

301
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
No.

302
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll sing a song I know.

303
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
Let you listen to that song.

304
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
No need.

305
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,520
Ling Rui, let me ask you a question.

306
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,040
Is Yu Shiyi better at singing?

307
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Or am I?

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,870
But I never heard you sing.

309
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,440
This kind of thing.

310
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,240
Do you have to listen

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,560
to get a conclusion?

312
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,520
Probably.

313
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm thirsty, I want to drink beer.

314
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,960
Peng Bo.

315
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,900
Drink with me.

316
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,840
Cheers.

317
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,870
Fangning.

318
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,160
Do you know why

319
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,920
Ling Rui is called

320
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,070
the flower on the hill?

321
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,380
Hill flower.

322
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,760
The hill is tall.

323
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,160
The terrain is a bit high.

324
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
And high places are cold.

325
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,680
Sometimes it's easy

326
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,440
to freeze your brain.

327
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,240
So don't you

328
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,880
get down to his level.

329
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,200
Did he make you angry again?

330
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,600
Yes.

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
I asked him if I sang better

332
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
or the Medical University Talented Girl.

333
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,720
He said he could only tell

334
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
after listening.

335
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,200
That was not what I meant.

336
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,960
Stop talking.

337
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,960
No matter who

338
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,910
cannot beat your wife at singing.

339
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,680
Do you need to ask?

340
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,960
Fangning,

341
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,220
look, it's not just you.

342
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,320
Even if a singer was here

343
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,600
he couldn't tell the difference.

344
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
The key is,

345
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
the issue is,

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,840
the fact is,

347
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,520
I really sing better.

348
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,200
Me.

349
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah, I think so too.

350
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Who are you?

351
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,920
You are his wife, right?

352
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,500
You two are

353
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,160
in a loving husband and wife relationship.

354
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
He and Yu Shiyi

355
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,760
were only ordinary classmates.

356
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
That's it.

357
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
Don't even talk about Yu Shiyi.

358
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,790
No one can compare to you.

359
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,520
What can Yu Shiyi compare with you?

360
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,110
Right?

361
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,600
Yes.

362
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
Listen, Fangning.

363
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
He is like this.

364
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
He is usually handsome,

365
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,830
looks smart.

366
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
When his brain is frozen

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
and he's dim-witted,

368
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,360
no one can argue with him.

369
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,340
Who's dim-witted?

370
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,680
Am I wrong?

371
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,720
For example, before we conduct surgery

372
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,310
he would always tell a joke.

373
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,280
He has been telling this joke

374
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,520
since university.

375
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,440
I told him

376
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,280
again and again

377
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,360
but he won't listen.

378
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,640
He thinks it's fun.

379
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,040
Tell me, is this guy stubborn?

380
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,440
-Stop it.
-He's just like that.

381
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,400
It's the same as when he confessed to me.

382
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
He asked me, "Did you have breakfast?"

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
"Did you have lunch?"

384
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,600
"Did you have dinner?"

385
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,910
Nothing else.

386
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,750
Right.

387
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,520
Cheers.

388
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,390
One more thing.

389
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
You know, before a surgery

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,080
we have to wash our hands.

391
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
He's so good.

392
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,350
The first one to go in and wash his hands.

393
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,400
Always the last one

394
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
to come out.

395
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,960
My gosh, those hands.

396
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,390
While washing his hands,

397
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,480
he talks to his hands!

398
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,960
You know?

399
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
He's like a pervert.

400
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,590
He does this at home too.

401
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,440
Always cleaning.

402
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,350
Forever cleaning.

403
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
And not only that,

404
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,680
he also asked me to wash my hands.

405
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
He's not satisfied after I washed it,

406
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
I have to wash it a second time.

407
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
You know what's the scariest thing?

408
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,960
What?

409
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,560
These hands

410
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
are just like his brother to him.

411
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,760
Even closer to him than I am.

412
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,920
Tell me, is he a pervert?

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,880
-Am I right?
-Yeah, pervert.

414
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,360
What pervert? Who is a pervert?

415
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,680
Ling Rui is not a pervert!

416
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,520
As a doctor

417
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,230
maintaining cleanliness

418
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,320
is very normal.

419
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,110
Moreover,

420
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,280
only when he is clean

421
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,760
his patients will be safe.

422
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,280
This shows that he is serious and responsible.

423
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
Did you hear that?

424
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,550
Did you hear that?

425
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,990
It's too difficult for me.

426
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,110
I know.

427
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,560
Don't be mad.

428
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,920
Okay?

429
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,510
Mom, I'm going out.

430
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,040
Come here.

431
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,830
What's wrong?

432
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,960
Sit.

433
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,040
You haven't been home recently.

434
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,760
What did you do?

435
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Something.

436
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,070
You work at the front desk,

437
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,040
why would you be so busy?

438
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,760
I blame Fangning.

439
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,800
She did this to you.

440
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,720
This has nothing to do

441
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,840
with my sister.

442
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,240
Shut up.

443
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
Tell me honestly,

444
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,800
what are you doing?

445
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,080
Just meeting friends.

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
You have a girlfriend?

447
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,000
Mom, you misunderstood.

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,160
That's good.

449
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,520
What's her family like?

450
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,950
Does she have a sister?

451
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,600
That doesn't matter.

452
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
As long as her family has a solid foundation.

453
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,150
You should get married quickly.

454
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,800
Then your dad would be happy.

455
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,640
The inheritance is yours.

456
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,760
Mom, you think too much.

457
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,710
You know

458
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,720
I am not interested

459
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
in these things.

460
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Are you short-minded or pig-headed?

461
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,030
Why are you not like me at all?

462
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,120
If you have nothing else, I'm leaving now.

463
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,320
Wait.

464
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,039
Where are you going?

465
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,760
Didn't I just say？

466
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,559
I'm meeting friends.

467
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,160
Girlfriend?

468
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,640
Take Mom with you.

469
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,840
Mom, you are thinking too much.

470
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,680
It's not convenient.

471
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm going to study.

472
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Study?

473
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,519
I didn't like studying when I was young.

474
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,760
What are you studying at this age?

475
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm learning how to do business.

476
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,039
Live and learn.

477
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,400
Just leave this matter

478
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,559
alone to me.

479
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm leaving now.

480
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
Don't leave. You…

481
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,040
[City Ballet]

482
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,920
Niuniu.

483
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,800
How is the class today?

484
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Are all the students here?

485
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,240
They are all here.

486
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,270
They are all here, right?

487
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,280
Right.

488
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,350
There are so many people in class today.

489
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,280
Quite a lot of people today.

490
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,480
Stinky kid, I thought you were studying?

491
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,830
Mom, why are you here?

492
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,120
Why am I here?

493
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,160
You are not at home every day.

494
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,560
Coming to a messy place like this.

495
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,270
If your dad knew he would kill you.

496
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
Go home with me.

497
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,520
-Go home and study.
-Mom.

498
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
-Hurry up.
-You misunderstood.

499
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,000
Misunderstood what? Learning to do business?

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
Mom, you misunderstood.

501
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,790
Misunderstood what?

502
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,480
Let's go.

503
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,200
Fangyu.

504
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,120
Erfan.

505
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,950
Mrs. Lu is here too?

506
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,120
I told you.

507
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,230
Don't tell others.

508
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,360
In the case where

509
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,160
Ms. Lu finds out…

510
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,200
Finds out about what?

511
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,760
You're afraid if Fangning finds out about what?

512
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
You two were hiding from her.

513
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,750
What are you doing secretly?

514
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,920
Mrs. Lu, it's like this.

515
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
I've been teaching Fangyu recently.

516
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,920
How to do business.

517
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,830
How to manage the company.

518
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,840
Correct.

519
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,510
But this matter

520
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,800
was done secretly.

521
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,520
That's why I chose this place.

522
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
Because I and the person in charge here

523
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,240
are good friends.

524
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,360
They say here

525
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
is quiet and we won't be disturbed.

526
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
I really dare not

527
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
let Ms. Lu know about this.

528
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
Otherwise, my

529
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,230
pay and leave will…

530
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,080
I hope you can understand.

531
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,680
After all, I just want to live.

532
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,080
I understand.

533
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,230
Of course I understand.

534
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,200
Good son.

535
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,680
You finally understand.

536
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Knowing how to learned behind Fangning's back.

537
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,910
Both of you are doing this is behind Fangning's back.

538
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,160
Mom is so happy.

539
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,390
But Mrs. Lu,

540
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm afraid if you are here

541
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,400
we will get noticed easily.

542
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,400
Correct.

543
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,110
Oh, yes.

544
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
I'll go then. I'll go now.

545
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Study well.

546
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,120
Mom is so relieved.

547
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,440
I'll make some soup for you.

548
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
To give you some nutrients.

549
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
Thank you, Mom.

550
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,120
I'll save you a bowl.

551
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
Good luck.

552
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
Mom, you're really leaving now?

553
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
Study well.

554
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,040
Teach him more, okay?

555
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Goodbye, Mrs. Lu.

556
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,200
Goodbye.

557
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,030
You're awesome.

558
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,990
Then I'm leaving too.

559
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,800
Erfan,

560
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,200
thank you.

561
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,960
It's nothing.

562
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,240
No matter what you do

563
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,200
I'll support you.

564
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,030
And I heard that your mother

565
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,200
is bad at cooking.

566
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,630
If she really made my portion,

567
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
you drink it for me.

568
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
Erfan,

569
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,200
don't you have anything

570
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,040
you want to ask me?

571
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,960
So all these years

572
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
you've been secretly

573
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,760
learning ballet.

574
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,680
Yes.

575
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,270
More than ten years already.

576
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,360
You are hiding it very well.

577
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
If I didn't

578
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,910
happen to be working nearby

579
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,280
won't you be exposed?

580
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,600
It's usually fine.

581
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,040
I never thought my mother

582
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,960
would follow me today.

583
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,160
But this is nothing

584
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
shameful.

585
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,720
Why are you hiding from your family?

586
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,000
You don't know about this.

587
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
I mentioned it to my mom before.

588
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,800
She scolded me

589
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,960
for half a month.

590
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400
Let alone my dad.

591
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,280
You also know my dad's temper.

592
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,270
Back then, my eldest sister

593
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
because…

594
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,680
Forget it.

595
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
By the way, Erfan,

596
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,440
I have something to ask you.

597
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,600
Erfan?

598
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,190
This one.

599
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,590
This is?

600
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,600
This is the male version of Swan Lake.

601
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,280
I know there's a

602
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,910
stereotype in most people's minds.

603
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
They think Swan Lake should be

604
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,880
for girls.

605
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
But this show,

606
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
I loved it since I was young.

607
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,640
The dance.

608
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,270
Now comes my chance.

609
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,720
This troupe

610
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
came to our school

611
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,040
and is casting the students.

612
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,030
I want to try.

613
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,520
Erfan.

614
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,520
Did you know?

615
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,840
Swan Lake is my elder sister's favorite

616
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,560
ballet.

617
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,360
When I went to see for the first time,

618
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,800
it was my sister who took me there.

619
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,800
After watching it

620
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
I was deeply attracted by it.

621
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
From that moment,

622
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,800
I feel that

623
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,870
it's the most important thing

624
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,150
in my life.

625
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,360
Now that I have a chance,

626
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,390
I want to interpret this dance

627
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,680
with my own methods.

628
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,000
After all,

629
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
this is the best gift I can give

630
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,160
to her.

631
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,630
That's very good.

632
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,640
I support you.

633
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,080
You know that

634
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
my parents are so strict,

635
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,080
they certainly won't allow me to do this.

636
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,080
Fangyu.

637
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,350
In the past,

638
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,720
I have a friend

639
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,920
who told me something.

640
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,640
Today, I will give these words to you.

641
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,080
Regret and frustration

642
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,710
are countless times worse

643
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,000
than fear.

644
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,360
So while there is still something

645
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,240
you want to do.

646
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,480
Just do it.

647
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,880
I support you.

648
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,440
Okay.

649
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Next.

650
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,590
Stretch a little.

651
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,830
Come here.

652
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,440
Me too.

653
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,440
You can just line up here.

654
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,000
This role suits you well.

655
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
Your styling is also very special.

656
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,920
We will contact you later.

657
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,950
-Thank you.
-Okay.

658
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

659
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,280
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

660
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Reporter Zhang,

661
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
I've been expecting you.

662
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,480
Please wait a moment.

663
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,960
I'll get the information on the performances.

664
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,910
In the future,

665
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,160
You have to write to us.

666
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Okay, I'll wait for you.

667
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,720
Okay.

668
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,600
A male version of Swan Lake.

669
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,640
[Ballet Troupe Registration Form]

670
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,000
Lu Fangyu.

671
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
Quite the unique last name.

672
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
I have a question.

673
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,720
Does the head of the Deer Sing Group

674
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
have a son?

675
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,310
Okay.

676
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,590
Interesting.

677
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,800
Sir.

678
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,230
There's a parcel for you.

679
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,560
Okay, you may go.

680
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,040
Okay.

681
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,360
How's my writing?

682
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,800
Great.

683
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,640
Amazing.

684
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
Awesome!

685
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,560
Oh my gosh.

686
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,400
Don't don't don't move.

687
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,800
Don't look!

688
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,390
Mr. Lu.

689
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,960
Why are you laughing so happily?

690
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Why?

691
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Look at what you did!

692
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,040
Look!

693
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
Look!

694
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,830
Look what you did!

695
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,600
Look!

696
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,150
Qiqi was sitting in the latest

697
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,080
Maserati model.

698
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,680
Smelling the gasoline at the gas station,

699
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,360
feeling a little uncomfortable.

700
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,920
Duan Muleng took out his gold card,

701
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,350
eyes staring sharply

702
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,720
at the gas station employee, and said,

703
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,760
"Air."

704
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,840
"Replace."

705
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,720
I think the author's brain

706
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
should be replaced instead.

707
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Are you all right?

708
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,190
Fangning.

709
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,040
Why did you buy so many snacks?

710
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,520
I eat them.

711
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Are they from Bai Jing?

712
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,320
No.

713
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
I bought them myself.

714
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,720
Here you go.

715
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,040
There are so many in the living room.

716
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,120
There are also in the kitchen lockers.

717
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,440
You'll be too full to have a proper meal.

718
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,720
I will eat it.

719
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,920
Stand properly.

720
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't move.

721
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,160
What do you want to eat tonight?

722
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
I want to

723
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,480
eat you.

724
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,000
Hello?

725
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,400
Fangyu, open the door.

726
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,080
Listen to Mom.

727
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
Good son, have you heard?

728
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
Fangyu, Fangyu!

729
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,240
Son.

730
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,230
Your father is angry.

731
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,040
Don't you…

732
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,240
Open the door now!

733
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,000
I can hear you.

734
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,910
Quickly open the door!

735
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Open the door.

736
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,600
Madam.

737
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,760
Sir said that

738
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
Fangyu must never go out.

739
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,440
You should leave him alone

740
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,600
so that he can calm down.

741
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Good son.

742
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
I know

743
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,040
there must be

744
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,280
a misunderstanding, right?

745
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,980
When your Dad feels better,

746
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,320
explain to him

747
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,710
and solve this misunderstanding.

748
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,190
You are his only son.

749
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,600
He won't ignore you.

750
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Open the door.

751
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
Open the door!

752
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
You make me so anxious, open the door!

753
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,320
Fangyu!

754
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,720
Fangyu.

755
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,880
Erfan.

756
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,800
How are you? You all right?

757
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm fine.

758
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,920
Well,

759
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,240
I did it too thoroughly

760
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,110
this time.

761
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,190
I'm afraid I can only rely on you.

762
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,520
Are you sure about this?

763
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Yes.

764
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
If you leave now,

765
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,720
you can never come back again.

766
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,360
Ok.

767
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

768
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,560
What are you doing?

769
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,560
Who are you guys?

770
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
-Come.
-Let me go.

771
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,440
Let me go.

772
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
-Let go.
-Let me go.

773
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,360
-Fangyu.
-Erfan.

774
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,320
Fangyu.

775
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,830
Let me go.

776
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,270
Fangyu.

777
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,670
Let me go.

778
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,150
Save me, Erfan!

779
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,000
-Save me!
-Fangyu!

780
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,800
Let me go!

781
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,190
Fangyu!

782
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,070
Let me go!

783
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,830
Are you hurt?

784
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm fine, Mom.

785
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,750
Why did you escape?

786
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,230
Why did you run away?

787
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,160
How dangerous it was!

788
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,520
You…

789
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,040
How can you escape?

790
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,070
-Big Brother.
-Look, your Dad is angry.

791
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,960
Calm down.

792
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,790
He is still a kid.

793
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,800
Don't be mad.

794
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,270
Go.

795
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,280
Big brother.

796
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,760
Wen… Wenbin.

797
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,390
Well, he…

798
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,400
He knew it was wrong.

799
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
He knows.

800
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,200
If he knows, that's fine.

801
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,360
Dad, what are you doing?

802
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,200
Stop!

803
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,080
Move aside!

804
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,520
You have no right to do this!

805
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,720
This is mine!

806
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Yours?

807
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,360
Everything on you

808
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,600
I gave it to you!

809
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
Even you are mine!

810
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,640
Son.

811
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,910
Dad, you can't cut it!

812
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,560
Let him cut it.

813
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,120
That is my thing!

814
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,160
-Let him cut it?
-How can you cut it?

815
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,480
-Mom will buy new ones for you.
-How can you cut it?

816
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,320
Mom, it's not about money.

817
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,720
This is my dream!

818
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,280
What's happening?

819
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
I could hear you yelling

820
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
from the entrance.

821
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Wonderful.

822
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,520
Fantastic.

823
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,040
Lu Wenbin, President of the Deer Sing Group.

824
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,310
What are you tearing apart?

825
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,040
A tutu?

826
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,080
Father and son fighting against each other.

827
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Sexism.

828
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,960
What else?

829
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,360
Drama in a rich family?

830
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,240
I heard you have been doing ballet.

831
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,590
That's pretty good.

832
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,120
Finally,

833
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,350
you have found something you are good at.

834
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,030
In this house,

835
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,080
other than the both of us

836
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
who love money,

837
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
there's finally an artist.

838
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,320
Isn't this a good thing?

839
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,630
Pretty gorgeous.

840
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,560
I bet you spent a lot of money?

841
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,520
It's also the money of our Lu family.

842
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,350
Keep it away.

843
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,190
What a shame to cut.

844
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,800
Oh, right.

845
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,920
Ling Rui and I,

846
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,840
Aunt Gao.

847
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,360
Yes?

848
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Put these dirty things away,

849
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,390
throw them into the sea.

850
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,640
-Okay.
-Stop.

851
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,910
-Stand aside!
-Don't move!

852
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,600
You!

853
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,990
Before coming, Ling Rui asked me

854
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,400
to talk to you

855
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
and be reasonable.

856
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,520
But I realized that people like you

857
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,920
can't be reasoned with.

858
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,960
The reason is right in front of you.

859
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
But you just don't want to watch or listen.

860
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,870
What did Lu Fangyu do wrong?

861
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,550
He did nothing wrong.

862
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,640
He is just doing

863
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,400
what he likes to do.

864
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,470
Big Sister.

865
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,120
Let him throw it and let him cut.

866
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,560
Anyway, I won't give up

867
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,470
my dreams.

868
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,560
I have loved dancing since I was a kid.

869
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,920
If it wasn't to not upset you

870
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,000
and not make mom sad…

871
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,680
-Don't say it.
-I have to say!

872
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,880
I won't think about anything else now!

873
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,840
Not even death!

874
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,120
Great, go then!

875
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
You can go die for me now!

876
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,200
Go what?

877
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,750
Say it.

878
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,120
What is it?

879
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,760
You can't say it?

880
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
After all, it's not your first time.

881
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,400
Say it, say it!

882
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,080
Fangning.

883
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,240
Anger cannot solve any problem.

884
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,590
Don't make yourself regret it.

885
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,080
Dad.

886
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
We're leaving now.

887
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,030
Let's go.

888
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,950
Go.

889
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:18,960
Go.

890
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,960
Lu Fangyu, come with me.

891
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,440
Big Brother.

892
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Calm down.

893
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,960
I'll go.

894
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,230
I'll deal with it.

895
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,520
Don't be mad.

896
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Don't be mad.

897
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,280
Okay?

898
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,480
Fangning.

899
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,710
Get in the car first.

900
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Let me talk to him.

901
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,720
Fangning.

902
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,520
It's okay.

903
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,080
Take care of Lu Fangyu.

904
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,200
Speak.

905
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,990
How do you want to persuade me?

906
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,439
Give him some time.

907
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
You saw it just now.

908
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,960
Your dad is actually feeling quite bad about it.

909
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
It's been ten years.

910
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,000
Is that not enough?

911
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
What's the difference between this case

912
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,160
and my sister's?

913
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,070
Because he is too authoritarian, my sister…

914
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,950
You can't blame him for today's matter.

915
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Fangyu's photo was sent by a reporter.

916
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,160
They are obviously

917
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,120
blackmailing your dad.

918
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,399
Your dad is also afraid

919
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,359
if something went wrong.

920
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:44,720
It might affect Fangyu's future

921
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,839
and Deer Sing's reputation.

922
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,030
Future?

923
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,399
He doesn't even know

924
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:51,149
what is the future Fangyu wants.

925
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Take it easy.

926
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,520
He will understand.

927
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,399
I don't expect him to understand.

928
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,280
If he did,

929
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,960
it won't be like this now

930
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,680
to Fangyu.

931
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,600
Fangning.

932
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Listen to me.

933
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,520
Fangyu's matter,

934
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,400
I will solve it.

935
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,190
These few days,

936
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,280
stop irritating your dad.

937
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,280
Whatever.

938
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,560
I don't want to

939
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,520
stay here anyway.

940
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,040
You will stay in the hotel temporarily, all right?

941
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,320
I've arranged everything for you.

942
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,710
Don't worry about the cost.

943
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,670
I will get Gao Erfan

944
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,240
to send you your luggage.

945
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:00,720
Okay.

946
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,480
Sister.

947
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,320
This time,

948
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,910
thank you so much.

949
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
You have called me a sister

950
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,390
so many times.

951
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,080
But this one just now was the most pleasant.

952
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,480
Lu Fangyu,

953
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,680
listen to me, all right?

954
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,600
Okay.

955
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,870
Regardless of your decision

956
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,600
in the future,

957
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,680
whatever you plan to do,

958
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,480
I will always support you.

959
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,640
So don't be afraid.

960
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,080
Okay.

961
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,950
All right.

962
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,880
Go.

963
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,230
Sister.

964
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm really going up.

965
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,280
Stop talking to me

966
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,720
like a coward.

967
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,400
Go.

968
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,080
Goodbye.

969
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
Fangning.

970
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,320
Fangning.

971
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,320
What happened?

972
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,200
Are you okay?

973
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,720
Ten years have passed.

974
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,680
I thought he has changed.

975
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,800
Until I saw Fangyu today,

976
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
I realized,

977
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,120
he is still like that.

978
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,520
Fangning.

979
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,960
You don't have to treat everyone

980
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,430
as your enemy.

981
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,160
You don't have to

982
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,120
close your heart to everyone.

983
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,640
We are married now,

984
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,630
I am willing to share with you

985
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,790
my happiness and pain,

986
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,560
every part of my life.

987
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,800
I hope you can do the same.

988
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,760
If

989
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
there's something

990
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,360
that can make you happy,

991
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,720
I am willing to do it for you.

992
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,630
Thank you.

993
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,360
Ling Rui.

994
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Can you accompany me to a place?

995
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,680
Before this,

996
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,240
I often come here alone,

997
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,750
standing right here

998
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,080
and observing the store.

999
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
Now,

1000
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,470
I'll be with you.

1001
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,590
You can watch it as long as you want.

1002
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,880
Ling Rui.

1003
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,790
Did you know?

1004
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
I have been telling you before,

1005
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,920
founding Infinite

1006
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,120
is my wish.

1007
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,720
Actually that's not true.

1008
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,790
This is not my wish.

1009
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,480
Founding Infinite

1010
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,760
all this while

1011
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,360
has been my elder sister's wish,

1012
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,980
if

1013
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,600
she hasn't left yet.
