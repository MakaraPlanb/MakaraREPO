[Episode 30]

4
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,350
So?

5
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm just here to take care of Youyou.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
Don't take it wrongly.

7
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,370
Youyou, what are you playing with?

8
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,110
Can I join you?

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay.

10
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,619
Let's find the pieces then.

11
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,500
All right, how?

12
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,950
We just need to

13
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:19,870
find the pieces of delicacy.

14
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,690
And bring them to the diner

15
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,730
so that we can

16
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,490
use this to make delicacies.

17
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,340
Let's start then.

18
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,800
Okay.

19
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,020
Put this in first.

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,690
Okay.

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,160
You got it wrong.

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Wrong?

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,670
No.

24
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,230
The second one.

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,820
The third one.

26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,500
Did I take it wrongly?

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,810
I wasn't thinking of anything.

28
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,660
Why is it so warm in here?

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,540
It's too stuffy in here.

30
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,380
What the hell?

31
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,050
Bro, do you need napkins?

32
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,140
There's a promotion.

33
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,680
With every set,

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,740
you get a lanyard with a Bai Jing design.

35
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,680
Right, the napkins you're using.

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
It feels nice.

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,500
A lanyard?

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,260
All right.

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,440
Then I want the one with Tang Ping's image.

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,170
Oh, no.

41
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,690
We don't have one with Tang Ping.

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,990
Only those with Bai Jing's image.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Why don't you have those with her image?

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,180
She is the ambassador too.

45
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,029
Very few people ask for hers.

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,500
We don't keep much stock of it.

47
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,960
Bai Jing is very popular.

48
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,550
It's okay you don't like it.

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,150
Your girlfriend must like it, right?

50
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,000
You can give it to your girlfriend,

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,050
or your female colleagues.

52
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,760
Right?

53
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,650
All right, I'll ask for ten sets.

54
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,250
Okay, I can give you an extra one,

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,640
eleven lanyards with Bai Jing's image.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,029
But I want lanyards with Tang Ping's image.

57
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,460
I really don't have any.

58
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,230
You see?

59
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,779
So you should

60
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:04,450
try your best to

61
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,920
satisfy the needs of customers, right?

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,180
You don't decide

63
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,230
who gets popular.

64
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,860
Right?

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,040
That's only

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,210
your superficial delusion.

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,680
What if people like me ask for one

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
with Tang Ping's image

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,740
and you don't have that?

70
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,790
You'll miss a good

71
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,840
business opportunity.

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,190
You seem to be a big fan of Tang Ping.

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,040
You don't have to know

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,220
whose a fan I am.

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,350
How about this?

76
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,990
I want a box of this,

77
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,340
but all with Tang Ping's image.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,650
All right. Wait here.

79
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,780
I'll call the office now.

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,720
And, report my feedback

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,020
to your company.

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,700
Okay, no problem.

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,620
Thank you.

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,640
Mr. Wang, yes!

85
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,320
He wants those with Tang Ping's image.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,490
Yes, Tang Ping.

87
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,210
A box.

88
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,010
Welcome back, Miss Pingping.

89
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,660
Thank you, Peng Bo.

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,250
Did you see everything?

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,760
Of course I saw that.

92
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,609
But don't worry

93
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,290
about my sales number.

94
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,550
Since you're a doctor,

95
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,940
you may not have much money.

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,540
I'll boost my sales volume

97
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,260
with my own endorsement fee.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,230
Don't worry about that, Miss Pingping.

99
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,490
I should do that.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,260
So don't worry about it.

101
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,040
I have

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,580
good news

103
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,380
to share with you.

104
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,640
Really?

105
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,900
You can go ahead.

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,010
I'm doing love scenes next.

107
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,060
Really?

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,990
When?

109
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,380
The investors

110
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,640
added few love scenes

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,770
to make up

112
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,650
for the duration.

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,740
Oh my.

114
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,750
That'll be great.

115
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,560
May I

116
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,520
see the script?

117
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,350
Miss Pingping,

118
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,160
are you ready for this?

119
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,210
I'm all set.

120
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,310
Then,

121
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,950
could you run it by me?

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,630
Of course.

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,000
I should

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,050
explain the plot first.

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,990
Now, imagine this place

126
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,210
as a bus.

127
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,100
We're colleagues

128
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,820
and always take the same bus home.

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,450
Okay.

130
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,340
Today,

131
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,180
we happened to

132
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,600
sit in the same row.

133
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,240
I fell asleep.

134
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,540
Okay.

135
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,020
Say, "Ready, action."

136
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,580
Ready, action.

137
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,380
The bus jolts.

138
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,090
I see.

139
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,550
Miss Pingping.

140
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,260
Stop it.

141
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,150
Miss Pingping.

142
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,670
Um.

143
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
You didn't look like you were on a bus.

144
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,000
You were just shaking like an earthquake.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,670
I...

146
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,170
Well, I enjoy the immersion.

147
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,430
I don't take the bus

148
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,060
very often.

149
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,000
As a layman,

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,680
I know that you're asked to

151
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,540
show the feeling of the first awakening of love,

152
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,270
yet you acted like a hungry beast.

153
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,870
That is not true at all.

154
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,390
If you're so great, show me how it's done.

♫ I've never wanted to escape from the palm of your hand ♫

191
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,110
♫ I love you forever ♫

192
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,060
♫ All I want is to be with you ♫

193
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,470
♫ I've never wanted to escape from the palm of your hand ♫

194
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,070
♫ Holding on to the past and present ♫

195
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,890
♫ And our future ♫

196
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,970
Ling Rui stayed here last night.

197
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,140
It smells great.

198
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,160
Youyou, are you full yet?

199
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,950
Yes.

200
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,420
Okay, Dad is going to clean up then.

201
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,230
Okay.

202
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,250
Morning, morning.

203
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:16,720
Morning.

204
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Morning.

205
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,049
Morning.

206
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,580
-Morning.
-Where is the breakfast?

207
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,680
Mom,

208
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,350
I've had

209
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,110
breakfast with Dad.

210
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,470
Dad made great porridge.

211
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,559
Great.

212
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,190
So yummy.

213
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,410
There is no porridge for me.

214
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,590
It should be eaten when it's still warm.

215
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,260
I didn't know

216
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,390
when you would wake up.

217
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,650
So I didn't prepare your portion.

218
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
Now it's...

219
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,550
It's okay. It's okay.

220
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,570
I can prepare it by myself.

221
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,150
Okay.

222
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,260
Youyou.

223
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,600
Anything else

224
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,860
you want to bring?

225
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,040
Ling Rui,

226
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,640
where are you taking Youyou?

227
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,030
My mom and aunts

228
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,580
are taking Youyou out for fun.

229
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,010
I'll send him there.

230
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,020
But don't worry.

231
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,660
I'll get him back before dinner.

232
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,540
No problem.

233
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,940
And you?

234
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,500
You don't need to send me.

235
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,340
I mean,

236
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,060
what's your plan for today?

237
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,410
Our university today...

238
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,380
No, not our university.

239
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,720
Our design exhibition

240
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,110
is will go live today.

241
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,460
And, well...

242
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,800
It's the first time

243
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,440
that our studio has held an exhibition here.

244
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,530
Though it's not grand,

245
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,920
the school expects much of it.

246
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,970
So we must all take part.

247
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,310
Shen Zhuo and I are both going.

248
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,080
Youyou.

249
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,890
Nothing else, right?

250
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,770
No.

251
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,280
Here.

252
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,210
I've brought all my favorites with me.

253
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,430
Okay, that's good.

254
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,690
Mom,

255
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,610
can I visit

256
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,370
your exhibition?

257
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,550
No.

258
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,650
We have a deal.

259
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,700
You'll go to the coffee shop

260
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,170
with Grandma.

261
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,300
Don't you remember that?

262
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,360
Be a man of your word, okay?

263
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,170
Okay then.

264
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:54,590
Mom.

265
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,230
I'll go rooting for you next time.

266
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,940
Bye-bye.

267
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,910
You're the best.

268
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,170
Have fun with Grandma.

269
00:18:59,170 --> 00:18:59,840
Be good.

270
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,470
All right.

271
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,530
Right, have you done any field inspections

272
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,580
at the art park?

273
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,680
I didn't.

274
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,780
It's a good chance.

275
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,450
There won't be the next one

276
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,040
if you miss it.

277
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,260
Okay, I'll consider it.

278
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,660
If you're not having

279
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,090
a stable job at home,

280
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,560
it's best that Youyou lives with me.

281
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,190
I'll go. I'll definitely go.

282
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,170
I'll consider it carefully.

283
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,170
You have my word.

284
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,900
Then it's up to you.

285
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,950
-Mom, bye.
-I'm waiting for your answer.

286
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,000
Um, bye.

287
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,480
Would you

288
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,530
-do the dishes for us?
-No problem.

289
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
Let's go, Youyou.

290
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,260
Have fun.

291
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,160
Bye.

292
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,700
You're pregnant!

293
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,750
Yes.

294
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,180
Who is the father?

295
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,230
I don't know.

296
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,320
Cut.

297
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,080
Pass.

298
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,260
Please take a break, Ms. Tang Ping.

299
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,940
Ms. Xinxin, prepare for the next scene.

300
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,720
Hello, Siyu?

301
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,690
How about me

302
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,120
treating you to desserts?

303
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,590
It's too early to have dessert.

304
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,800
Countless people are rushing me

305
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,430
to post an update.

306
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,320
Goodbye.

307
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,530
What updates?

308
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,830
It's always about

309
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,770
"I love you, you love me."

310
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,650
"I don't love you

311
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,740
when you love me."

312
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,630
Love or not, just give it some thought.

313
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,390
It's not like you're a prodigy writer.

314
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,530
Where is my muse? My muse!

315
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,700
Hello, Fangning.

316
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,760
Where are you? Let's meet up.

317
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,600
Ling Rui was mean.

318
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,080
He didn't even send his best wish.

319
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,620
Would he come or not?

320
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,340
Lu Fangning,

321
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,200
why are you here wandering?

322
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,040
Go inside.

323
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,050
You know how I hate

324
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,310
this kind of situation.

325
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,570
I can't handle it without you.

326
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,940
Ms. Lu, what are you doing?

327
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,290
I know you've had

328
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,210
a hard time recently.

329
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,430
But look,

330
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,770
we have the results here.

331
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,280
Your efforts have paid off.

332
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,710
The designs of our studio

333
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,760
are going

334
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,030
to make a wave in the news,

335
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,720
return to its prime, and make history!

336
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,570
Let's amaze those students.

337
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,450
Forget it.

338
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,250
Those students

339
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,050
have their eyes

340
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,980
wide open

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,490
to nitpick on us.

342
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,130
My designs are perfect.

343
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,350
What can they nitpick?

344
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,830
But it's

345
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,800
quite a pity

346
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,110
that you can't let people who know you

347
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,530
see the achievements you have now.

348
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,850
How about I call the one

349
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,940
who tore apart your family

350
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,160
several years ago?

351
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,130
Who was it again? I'll call him.

352
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,740
Fangning.

353
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,310
Ling Rui.

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,780
Why are you here?

355
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,220
I just sent Youyou home.

356
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,610
Then I remembered your exhibition

357
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,910
was going live today.

358
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,380
I came here to check it out.

359
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,640
Congratulations.

360
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,900
Thank you.

361
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,740
What's wrong?

362
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,880
It's dirty.

363
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Thank you.

364
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,460
I just changed my clothes today.

365
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,350
Right.

366
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,290
Long time no see.

367
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,300
You pretended to be

368
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,650
Youyou's father the last time,

369
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,790
Mr. Shen.

370
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,260
Father?

371
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,990
What do you mean?

372
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,300
You must be kidding, Mr. Ling.

373
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,530
You're pulling a joke on me.

374
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,450
Right?

375
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,840
I didn't get the chance

376
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,970
to thank you.

377
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,230
Mr. Shen.

378
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,750
For what?

379
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,180
I must thank you

380
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,480
for sending Youyou home.

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,260
Outside of our apartment,

382
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,810
Mr. Shen

383
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,990
said he was Youyou's father.

384
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,770
Godfather.

385
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,790
Godfather.

386
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,050
I mean it.

387
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,620
Is the exhibition hall nearby?

388
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,010
-Godfather?
-Godfather.

389
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,320
Yes, he is.

390
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,620
Yeah.

391
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,840
You can go ask Youyou.

392
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,780
So I got it all wrong.

393
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,370
Godfather?

394
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,430
I'm the godmother. We're like a couple.

395
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,660
I remember now.

396
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,550
That was why you ran away so fast

397
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,850
and worked so hard.

398
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,860
I hope you can keep up

399
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,790
the good work

400
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,010
and give it your best.

401
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,730
For Youyou's future,

402
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,900
Godfather.

403
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,540
It's my fault. My fault.

404
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,550
I'm a sinner.

405
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,560
All right? You two.

406
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Leave the knotty students

407
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,120
to me.

408
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,300
I'll deal with them, okay?

409
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,720
Bye. Bye.

410
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,290
You treated him like that

411
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,830
on purpose, right?

412
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,810
Yes.

413
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,120
How come you're…

414
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,640
Because I don't like it

415
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,490
when Youyou calls another man father.

416
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I got it.

417
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,240
Ms. Lu,

418
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,180
the students want to consult you

419
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,860
about a design case.

420
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,030
Oh, okay.

421
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,290
I'll get there in a minute.

422
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,390
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

423
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,730
You're welcome.

424
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,080
I...

425
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:07,840
You can go first.

426
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,010
I'll pick you up later.

427
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,530
We'll have dinner with Youyou.

428
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,830
Here is the case.

429
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,220
The students have been

430
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,610
assisting me all the time,

431
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,710
so I planned to take them out

432
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,340
to a nice dinner when it's over.

433
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,230
All right. We can have dinner together.

434
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,910
Together?

435
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
Carry on. I'll come later.

436
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,740
Wait a minute.

437
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,990
What? Who are you?

438
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,920
The one who sold soy sauce,

439
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,300
don't you think I won't recognize you

440
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,270
because you wear glasses now.

441
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,600
You're Tang...

442
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,570
You're Lu Fangning's

443
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,700
defeated opponent, Tang, right?

444
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,540
That's me.

445
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,800
What do you want?

446
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm here to

447
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,830
exact punishment on heaven's behalf!

448
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,920
Why did you pretend to

449
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,470
be Lu Youyou's father?

450
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,350
Why do you want to break up

451
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,360
Lu Fangning and Dr. Ling?

452
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,620
I didn't.

453
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,830
Don't deny it.

454
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,060
I quit, so they could be together.

455
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,030
I won't allow you

456
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,910
to destroy it!

457
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,080
I couldn't win his love,

458
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,840
so I won't let another character

459
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,640
sideline me!

460
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,810
Are you crazy?

461
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,200
Who likes Lu Fangning?

462
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,250
You like her.

463
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,930
Me?

464
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,690
Yeah.

465
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,480
If you didn't like her,

466
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,460
why did you

467
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,260
tell Dr. Ling

468
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,310
you were Lu Youyou's father?

469
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,310
If you were

470
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,280
Youyou's father,

471
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,040
their relationship

472
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,620
would fall apart

473
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,830
for good!

474
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Why wouldn't you

475
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,350
let them be together?

476
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,820
There could only be one reason.

477
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,710
You are

478
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,730
in love with Lu Fangning.

479
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,830
That does

480
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,130
make sense.

481
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,900
But deep down,

482
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,410
do I like Lu Fangning?

483
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,590
Impossible.

484
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,850
I was not

485
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,150
the innocent boy anymore.

486
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,710
I won't fall for

487
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,670
Lu Fangning's feint.

488
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,810
I'd rather be in love with you

489
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,990
than with her.

490
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,430
Why would you say that about me?

491
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,690
Why do you like me?

492
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,680
Can't I like you?

493
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,310
You are

494
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,530
more considerate, gentle,

495
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,170
and lovely

496
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,770
than that lunatic Lu Fangning, right?

497
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,300
So, I'm better than Lu Fangning?

498
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,390
Of course.

499
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,870
So you like me more.

500
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,390
Maybe...

501
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,860
If you want to see it that way,

502
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,670
yes.

503
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,830
You have no idea

504
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,620
what I've been through

505
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,510
over the past six years.

506
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,310
I was afraid to voice my frustration.

507
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,450
I stood on my knees!

508
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,170
We're partners.

509
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,930
How could she treat me like that?

510
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,400
If it weren't for her misfortune

511
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,160
of losing her company,

512
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,800
I wouldn't work with her.

513
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,720
Yes.

514
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,900
That's exactly who Lu Fangning is.

515
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,830
You know what?

516
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,090
There have been many boys

517
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,350
who like me since my childhood.

518
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,160
Fanfan, Dingding, Liangliang, and Pengpeng

519
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,510
were always trying to win my heart.

520
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,180
But Lu Fangning

521
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,820
took them from me.

522
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,870
You know why?

523
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,550
Because she was jealous of me.

524
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,180
Yes.

525
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,520
Cause I was better than her,

526
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,950
prettier than her,

527
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,120
and I had a better figure.

528
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,220
I didn't expect that

529
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,520
Lu Fangning was such a jerk.

530
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,370
She flirted with me

531
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,250
while we were in university

532
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,370
all the time.

533
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,150
I was too silly

534
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,070
and I took that

535
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,830
as a hint of her interest in me.

536
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,820
I didn't expect that

537
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,540
Lu Fangning was such a fraud.

538
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,420
A fraud!

539
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,080
Cheers.

540
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,810
Cheers.

541
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,800
I checked the reviews.

542
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,060
This restaurant

543
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,320
seemed good.

544
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,290
The chefs here

545
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,370
are first-class.

546
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,260
Yes, I've been here before.

547
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,990
Their cuisines are unique.

548
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,710
Great.

549
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,470
It's a pity

550
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,690
that Master Shen couldn't come.

551
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,030
Leave him alone.

552
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,210
He never mistreats himself.

553
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,640
I bet he's having a feast right now.

554
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,370
- Good then.
- Thank you, Ms. Lu.

555
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,540
Go ahead. Suit yourself.

556
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:48,960
Enjoy it.

557
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,880
Try this.

558
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,940
How shall we

559
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,690
address your husband?

560
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,940
I'm her friend. My name is Ling Rui.

561
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,750
Ling Rui.

562
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,270
It sounds familiar.

563
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,990
I know, sir.

564
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,420
The star professor

565
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,630
from the medical school

566
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,810
whose posters get stolen

567
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,320
by female students

568
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,580
every time he gives a speech.

569
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,420
Right?

570
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,390
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

571
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,980
Yes, yes.

572
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,790
I've heard a lot about you.

573
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,800
Ms. Lu's friends

574
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,480
are no

575
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,700
ordinary commoners.

576
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,710
We've all heard about your feats.

577
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,810
What feats?

578
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,580
It's nothing.

579
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,680
Like teachers, doctors also

580
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,240
serve society.

581
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,510
Thank you so much

582
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,770
for helping Fangning

583
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,780
with the exhibition.

584
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,000
Eat heartily.

585
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,260
Okay.

586
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,550
Thank you.

587
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,440
Come on, let's eat.

588
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,330
Go ahead.

589
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,530
Professor Ling.

590
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,600
You do not seem like

591
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,870
an ordinary friend of Ms. Lu.

592
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,880
-Right?
-Yes.

593
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,400
Something is going between you two.

594
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,030
That's right!

595
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,490
Yes.

596
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,030
Are you dating?

597
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,750
Yes.

598
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,760
It's possible.

599
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,810
I feel so.

600
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,970
Me too.

601
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,060
All right. Stop it.

602
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,320
I won't treat you to dinner again

603
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,870
if you keep prying on their privacy.

604
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,170
Why can't I move my hands?

605
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,050
There is no problem.

606
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,150
I can't get inspiration!

607
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,060
The annoying old man

608
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,030
said he'd be free every weekend,

609
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,380
why isn't he coming?

610
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,320
I knew it.

611
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,000
Is it this room?

612
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm sorry.

613
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,890
Teachers and students,

614
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,020
I'm here for someone.

615
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,240
Ye.

616
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,260
This is for you.

617
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,700
There are people here. What are you doing?

618
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,340
To send you the flowers.

619
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,430
I've been waiting for you

620
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,230
at the dorm entrance.

621
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,280
Your roommates said you were here.

622
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,960
It wasn't easy to find you.

623
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
Just accept it.

624
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,850
I don't want them.

625
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,900
How can a girl

626
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,990
send flowers to a boy?

627
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,050
Why not?

628
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,480
I don't like it.

629
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,990
You don't like it?

630
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,300
Flowers are impractical.

631
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,180
But never mind,

632
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,530
you can like me.

633
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,040
Take it.

634
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,090
No.

635
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,850
All right.

636
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,990
Take a chair and sit down.

637
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,420
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

638
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,730
Move over a little bit.

639
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
Sit down.

640
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,470
Ms. Lu, Professor Ling.

641
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,070
I hope you wouldn't mind.

642
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,750
This is a follower

643
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,300
of the very best student

644
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,480
in our major.

645
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:45,950
The girl

646
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,120
has no bad intentions.

647
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,510
She is cute.

648
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,520
She does look cute.

649
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,870
It's okay. I don't mind.

650
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,880
It's okay.

651
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,140
All right.

652
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,660
Don't you feel embarrassed

653
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,550
with so many people here?

654
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,460
No.

655
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,030
The more, the merrier.

656
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,290
Why didn't you

657
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,230
reply to my message?

658
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,360
I...

659
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,380
Just eat.

660
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,560
I know you care about me.

661
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,060
Just say it if you like me.

662
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,710
It's a bit easier for girls to woo boys.

663
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,560
The Internet tells the truth.

664
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,490
Oh, come on.

665
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,510
It's too mushy.

666
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,600
That's right.

667
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Does this scene remind you of something?

668
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,230
No.

669
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
That's right.

670
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
Yeah.

671
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,170
Who likes girls wooing boys?

672
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,670
I don't.

673
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,590
Enough.

674
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,060
I almost forget the serious topic

675
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,450
because you interrupted.

676
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,100
The exhibition

677
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,990
held by our major

678
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,330
and Ms. Lu

679
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,420
was a success.

680
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,110
The leader of the university praised us.

681
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,580
Thanks to

682
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,220
Ms. Lu and Master Shen.

683
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,770
Since Master Shen is not here,

684
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,800
I'll propose a toast to Ms. Lu.

685
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,430
Good.

686
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,520
-Good.
-Yes.

687
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,530
Thank you.

688
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,420
Bottom-up!

689
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,170
Sir,

690
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,190
she's had too much wine.

691
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,740
I'll take this for her. Cheers.

692
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,670
All right.

693
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,730
Ling Rui, you can't drink much.

694
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,320
I'm fine.

695
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,970
Why can't Professor Ling drink?

696
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,710
-Professor Ling is so cool.
-Impressive!

697
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:12,800
Impressive!

698
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,900
Professor Ling is so cool.

699
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,520
Why do you...

700
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,140
I'm sorry.

701
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,980
You go ahead.

702
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,940
I'll answer a call.

703
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,380
Sis,

704
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,270
I bet he's your new friend.

705
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,650
You may not know that.

706
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,740
The students

707
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,960
from medical school told me

708
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,720
Professor Ling would never have any trouble with drinking.

709
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,370
It takes more than ten shots o make his face red.

710
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,450
Yeah.

711
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:43,800
That's true.

712
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,500
-That's right.
-Yes.

713
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,060
He sure can drink.

714
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,390
Yes.

715
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,070
Really?

716
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,810
Yes.

717
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,850
What's wrong?

718
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,870
Nothing.

719
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,240
Stop it.

720
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,890
You've had enough.

721
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,280
Here, Professor. Thank you.

722
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,720
Okay, here. Ms. Lu and Professor Ling.

723
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,270
Let's have a toast

724
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,490
to celebrate.

725
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,290
-To celebrate.
-Cheers!

726
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,510
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

727
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:44,450
Lu Fangning.

728
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Why do you come back to the campus?

729
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,740
Because I have something

730
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,000
to ask you here.

731
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,890
Over there, over there.

732
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,050
Why did you ignore me?

733
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,960
I've told you that.

734
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,280
To avoid unnecessary troubles.

735
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,240
Troubles?

736
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,710
Who is the trouble?

737
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
You or me?

738
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,420
You're drunk.

739
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,180
I think so.

740
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,450
I feel a little bit drunk.

741
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,460
But I'm happy.

742
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,870
What's wrong with you?

743
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,140
You drank as much as I did.

744
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,620
How are you still so calm?

745
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,240
Your ears are red.

746
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,410
You used to recite

747
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,680
the medical books

748
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,540
when you got drunk, right?

749
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,220
Now you've changed.

750
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,610
Your ears turn red.

751
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,550
I noticed it.

752
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,630
Let's go sit over there.

753
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,370
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

754
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,590
I'm fine.

755
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,890
You can't drink as much as you used to.

756
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,000
I...

757
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,190
I haven't had social activities

758
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,290
for so many years. That's for sure.

759
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,920
What's about you?

760
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,570
When did you learn to drink so well?

761
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,880
You can drink more than I do.

762
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,020
I had been practicing

763
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,880
after you left.

764
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,990
Come here.

765
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
Let me ask you.

766
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,910
Do you feel like

767
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,430
the silly girl today

768
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,400
reminded you of me?

769
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,780
You two are quite similar

770
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,170
in some ways.

771
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,840
I knew it.

772
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,580
Silly girl. Silly girl.

773
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,060
I knew that's how

774
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,010
you thought of me.

775
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,690
I bought you flowers and wooed you.

776
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,580
I thought I was cool.

777
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,960
But actually,

778
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,440
I never considered

779
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,530
your feelings.

780
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,890
I saw the boy today.

781
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,420
He felt a little embarrassed, right?

782
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,250
I'm sorry.

783
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,220
Previously,

784
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,190
I've brought you

785
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,320
so many troubles.

786
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm sorry.

787
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,710
I'm sorry.

788
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,060
You're too drunk.

789
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,030
You can't see straight.

790
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,730
You're talking nonsense.

791
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,970
I can.

792
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,780
It's been six years.

793
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,890
Ling Rui.

794
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,680
It's been six years.

795
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,710
Both you and I have changed.

796
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,950
We're not the same as before.

797
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,350
So I figured it out.

798
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,840
What did you figure out?

799
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,230
If you want to

800
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,090
be in a relationship

801
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,310
or get married, that's okay.

802
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,900
You don't have to tell me.

803
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,580
You don't have to tell me

804
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,150
who you're in love with.

805
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,360
And I won't

806
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,090
harass you

807
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,680
in any capacity.

808
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,720
You don't have to

809
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,070
worry about Youyou.

810
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,000
He is a good boy.

811
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,270
I'll tell Youyou

812
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,100
that he has

813
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,330
a great father.

814
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,270
And he has the right to

815
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,770
pursue his own happiness.

816
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,080
So don't worry.

817
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,910
About Ms. Yu,

818
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,880
if you like her,

819
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,970
commit to the relationship.

820
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,420
I'm serious.

821
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,950
I said

822
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,510
she was a bad person, right?

823
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,020
I said it out of spite.

824
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
I think she is nice.

825
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,220
Youyou likes her too.

826
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:48,980
If you two

827
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,910
form a family together,

828
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,970
I'll be happy for you.

829
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,120
All the best.

830
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,390
Do you

831
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,740
really think so?

832
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,270
I won't bother you anymore.

833
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,680
What are you doing?

834
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,560
Lu Fangning.

835
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,300
I know you're not that drunk.

836
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,580
Can you see it clearly now?

837
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:39,890
Who am I?

838
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,020
Ling Rui.

839
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,950
Who am I to you?

840
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,420
My ex-husband.

841
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,690
Your ex-husband.

842
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,170
Lu Fangning.

843
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,270
From the moment

844
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,740
you showed up

845
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,000
in my life six years ago,

846
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,470
you've been like this.

847
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,050
You come and go as you want.

848
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,490
Yes.

849
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,310
You chose for me

850
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,190
to go to Germany.

851
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,420
But so what?

852
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,890
To forget you,

853
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,200
I can handle alcohol

854
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,430
better than you now.

855
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,140
Are you satisfied?

856
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,650
After I came back,

857
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,800
I went to your apartment...

858
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,910
to see if the light

859
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,380
would be on again.

860
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,950
I went to Deer Sing's mall,

861
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,140
wondering I might meet you.

862
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,900
I wanted to check on you secretly.

863
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,260
But I never saw you.

864
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,420
Why didn't you come back?

865
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,110
Were you too busy?

866
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,960
Were you sick?

867
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,010
Didn't you miss me at all?

868
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,700
You fought with someone over me

869
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,470
when you felt like it,

870
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,150
as if you loved me so much.

871
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,060
You avoided me when you felt upset.

872
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,700
What about the next time?

873
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,850
Are you going to leave

874
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,780
without a word

875
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,290
taking Youyou with you?

876
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,710
Lu Fangning.

877
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,070
You always decided without considering my feelings.

878
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,600
We have

879
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,160
a son now.

880
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,010
Yet you told me

881
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,410
you wouldn't bother my life anymore.

882
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,480
Listen carefully.

883
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,340
Youyou is our kid,

884
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,610
he's the eternal bond between us.

885
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,980
Don't you ever take him away.

886
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,090
I will always be

887
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,760
part of your life.

888
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:11,760
Ling Rui.

889
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,950
Do you think

890
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,850
I don't have the right

891
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,770
to ask you to stay

892
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,690
as your ex-husband?

893
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,250
Is that so?

894
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,910
I...

895
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,690
Let's make it work this time.

896
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,820
What do you mean?

897
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,330
We'll start over.

898
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,350
I...
