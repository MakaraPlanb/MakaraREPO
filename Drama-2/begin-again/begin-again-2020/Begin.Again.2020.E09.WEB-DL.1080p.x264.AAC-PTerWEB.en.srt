Have you

5
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:43,970
ever been in love?

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,090
I...

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,770
Yes, I think.

8
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,650
That's good.

11
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,910

and do a proper analysis

14
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:07,970
for me.

15
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,520
I have a friend

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,850
who really needs a child.

17
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,800
So, she found a guy

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,770
whom she likes very much,

19
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,570
and got married.

20
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,520
But after they got married,

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,089
they have never slept on the same bed.

22
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,040
My friend has tried

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,610
many times,

24
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,850
but to no avail.

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,800
Do you think the problem lies

26
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,680
with my friend or the man?

27
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,970
Oh, so that's

28
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,490
why you married Dr. Ling.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,370
So you...

30
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm talking about my friend.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes, your friend.

32
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,440
Yes.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,680
Never mind.

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't think you know how
to solve it. Go back to work.

35
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,760
Ms. Lu.

36
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,520
This is actually very simple.

37
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,040
Just let your friend show

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,520
all of her charm.

39
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,240
She's your friend,

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,810
so she must be someone like you.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,200
No one could resist

42
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,770
a girl like you.

43
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,090
I know that.

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,000
But I...

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
I mean, my friend has tried that.

46
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,730
It didn't work.

47
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,250
She has tried it?

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
Really?

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Why didn't it work?

50
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,520
It didn't work even you...

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
It's clear that this man

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,070
has a noble personality.

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,250
He's not an ordinary man

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Ms. Lu,

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,240
your friend really has good taste.

57
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,730
About this situation,

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,610
my idol has said that

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,890
to lure an adult,

60
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,370
we need to stop being human.

61
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,210
There are three methods.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,930
You could be a cat,

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,240
or a tiger,

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,720
or a dog who got wet in the rain.

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,570
I didn't say that.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,920
It's not you.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,370
She's my idol
from the entertainment industry.

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
You have good taste in picking your idols.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,890
But,

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,520
how exactly should I apply this?

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,570
It's a bit difficult

72
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,930
to actually do that.

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,050
But the advice from my other idol

74
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,040
in another industry

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240

80
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,359
Because their identities

81
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,520
are similar to that of your friend.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Your friend could find some inspiration

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
from these books.

84
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,440
For example,

85
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,240
how to show her charm.

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,330

87
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,050

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,170

89
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,560
It won't be a problem for her
to take him down.

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,930
You can think of someone close to you,

91

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,040
-So I thought...
-First of all,

381
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,370
it's my call

382
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,680
whether I have

383
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,200
important appointments.

384
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,770
Secondly,

385
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,920
it's a waste of

386
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,040
medical resources

387
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,120
to change a doctor's schedule.

388
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,000
Lastly,

389
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,170
I would like you not to

390
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,210
intervene in my job and my life

391
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,400
too much in the future.

392
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
Am I not part of your life?

393
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,490
You are.

394
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,730
But...

395
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,480
But what?

396
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
But we...

397
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
We're just bonded by a contract.

398
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
A contract?

399
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,800
It's just a contract?

400
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,840
You think I like

401
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,880
to watch you riding on

402
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,650
some merry-go-round

403
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,450
and play bumper cars with you

404
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
like an idiot?

405
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,280
I even acted like

406
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,920
the CEOs in the novels,

407
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,440
called you silly,

408
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
and put my hand on a tree,

409
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
hurting my own palms.

410
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,450
Even the kids were laughing at me.

411
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,240
I did all these just

412
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
to make you happy.

413
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,850
You're doing this just

414
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,960
to achieve your own goal.

415
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,010
What goal?

416
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,590
I don't want to talk about it.

417
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
I want to have a baby, right?

418
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,810
What's up?

419
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,490
Why are you embarrassed to

420
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,200
say that out loud?

421
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,920
I just want a baby.

422
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,080
Say something.

423
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,490
Alright.

424
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,930
Let me ask you a question.

425
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,640
Do you love me?

426
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,450
Does it

427
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,230
matter whether I love you

428
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,320
or not?

429
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,760
I think this is something

430
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,130
that has to do with love.

431
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,450
I hope you can understand

432
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,240
and respect me.

433
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,830
Aren't we married?

434
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,080
Lu Fangning, you really want

435
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,890
a baby that much, huh?

436
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,370
Yes, I do.

437
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,440
Okay.

438
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,250
I'll give you what you want.

439
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,170
Let's give it a shot.

440
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
But you must not

441
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,490
run away this time.

442
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,840
Deal.

443
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I won't run away.

444
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,210
Didn't you do everything

445
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,760
to get this?

446
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,720
I think

447
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,480
we can do it

448
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,050
step by step.

449
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,090
What's up?

450
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:58,970
Are you scared?

451
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,490
Scared?

452
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
My hair was stuck.

453
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,450
Just give me a second.

454
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
One second, okay?

455
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,800
Lu Fangning, haven't you been waiting

456
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,810
for this day to come?

457
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,960
What are you waiting for? Get inside.

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's the first time.

459
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,720
It's normal to be a bit nervous.

460
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,560
About what?

461
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,520
Just close your eyes
and you'll have a baby.

462
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,560
But I was so frivolous

463
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,680
in front of him.

464
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,610
If he finds out

465
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,000
I have no experience,

466
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,970
isn't that embarrassing?

467
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,320
You don't need to care about that.

468
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,290
When this story got out,

469
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,280
how would Cai Siyu think of you?

470
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,080
Once Tang Ping knows,

471
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,090
she is gonna jump to the sky.

472
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,930
You were just bragging

473
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,930
with that girl at the front desk.

474
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,570
Have you forgotten?

475
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,280
If you went out alone,

476
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,450
what would she think of you?

477
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,130
If you go out alone now,

478
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,990
it'll be more embarrassing.

479
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,410
Lu Fangning, don't you want a baby?

480
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,600
Don't be scared, go inside.

481
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,530
You're right.

482
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,650
Wait, wait.

483
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,640
Hold on, hold on.

484
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,550
Why do we still need to wait some more?

485
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,210
We've waited long enough.

486
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,370
You just want a baby, don't you?

487
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,770
I knew you are afraid.

488
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
Honey,

489
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,650
I'll be up in a minute.

490
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,560
Ms. Lu,

491
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,080
How's your charm working?

492
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,080
Ling Rui,

493
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,440
you're a beast.

494
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,120
This will not do.

495
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,160
Is there anything more exciting?

496
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
Is this not exciting enough?

497
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,160
It doesn't make any sense.

498
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,600
Is Dr. Ling unwilling?

499
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,730
It's not that.

500
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,360
The problem is with me.

501
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,170
How is the problem

502
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,850
with you, Ms. Lu?

503
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Can you?

504
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
Of course,

505
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,960
I can't.

506
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
Ms. Lu,

507
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,840
you have a serious problem

508
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,250
which could not be solved

509
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,090
by the books.

510
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,400
So what am I supposed to do?

511
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,840
How about

512
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
asking for help from someone else?

513
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,690
If I could find someone else,

514
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,880
why did I ask you?

515
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,440
If you don't ask someone else,

516
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,840
how do you know for sure

517
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,800
it's your problem?

518
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,570
Well, who am I gonna talk to?

519
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,520
Ms. Lu.

520
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,050
I didn't know you had important business.

521
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,960
Well, I'll come back later.

522
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
What are you doing here?

523
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,690
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group

524
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,240
will be here soon.

525
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:57,970
[LM Deer Sing Group]

526
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,240
Yujiang.

527
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,960
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group.

528
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,730
Who is that?

529
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,480
This is Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group?

530
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,800
Director Lu's ex...

531
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,240
fiancee?

532
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,170
She's so tall,
yet she's wearing high heels.

533
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,280
That must be expensive.

534
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,970
Perfect figure, pretty face.

535
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
And her presence

536
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,040
is almost like that of Ms. Lu.

537
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,290
Qin Yujiang, and Cai Siyu.

538
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,320
Only our names are similar.

539
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,720
It's god's will.

540
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
I heard you just got back today,

541
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,520
and you came here
right after you got off the plane.

542
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,600
You're so hardworking.

543
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,520
Not as good as you.

544
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,400
You're running Deer Sing alone.

545
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,880
You even used your marriage
as a marketing stunt.

546
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
I hadn't come back in time,

547
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,330
or I would have witnessed it.

548
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,350
This time you've come to us

549
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,490
for the production lines.

550
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,530
It must be

551
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,480
for Infinity, I presume.

552
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,290
Yujiang,

553
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,570
you really know a lot about

554
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,720
about our Deer Sing.

555
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,690
You're an important client of Jiang Cheng.

556
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,880
Knowing about the Deer Sing

557
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,320
means we're taking you seriously.

558
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,730
I will be responsible

559
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,920
and follow up on

560
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,610
this production line in person.

561
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,690
Isn't that a little

562
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,040
unnecessary?

563
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,360
You're so busy.

564
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
Why do you have to do everything yourself?

565
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,510
If I don't do this,

566
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,410
how could we show that

567
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,730
we value Deer Sing?

568
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,880
I know that Lu Yiyao is back.

569
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,330
Now he is chiefly in charge of

570
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,200
your product development.

571
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,360
I'll talk to him.

572
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,530
I know Infinity

573
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,440
the best.

574
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,960
Talk to me. It's more direct.

575
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:31,880
Lu Fangning.

576
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,410
I won't talk to you.

577
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
I only talk to Lu Yiyao.

578
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,070
[Qin Yujiang]

579
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,080
Never mind.

580
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,330
If you don't want to see her,

581
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,960
just forget it.

582
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,390
No problem.

583
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,880
She won't make a fuss

584
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
out of nothing.

585
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,800
I'll do it.

586
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,930
Uncle.

587
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,040
Why did you break up

588
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
with her back then?

589
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,370
Why did you suddenly

590
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,320
decide to go abroad?

591
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,570
All these years,
neither Qin Yujiang,

592
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,650
nor you have mentioned anything.

593
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,960
I'm not being nosy.

594
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,370
I only care about you.

595
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,890
If you really don't want to talk about it,

596
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,200
I can understand.

597
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,040
We...

598
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,450
We just found that

599
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,600
we weren't suitable for each other.

600
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,570
You were together for two years,

601
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,510
and right when you were
about to get married,

602
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,400
you found that you were not compatible
with each other?

603
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,400
Sometimes,

604
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,710
it only takes one moment to

605
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,920
realize that.

606
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,530
Okay, I give up.

607
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,760
Relationships are so confusing.

608
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,090
Let alone someone else's.

609
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,890
But if it's truly

610
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,040
like you said,

611
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,840
Qin Yujiang is not sentimental,

612
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,120
that will be good.

613
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,400
The main product of Infinity

614
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,520
this time is

615
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,760
so special.

616
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,400
If we can't get

617
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,390
Jiang Cheng's support,

618
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,240
I'm gonna have a headache.

619
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,090
I won't let that happen.

620
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,440
I'll take care of everything for you.

621
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,770
Alright, don't worry.

622
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,410
I've made a contingency plan.

623
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,240
I just

624
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,610
don't want things

625
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,720
to come to that.

626
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,970
I've already contacted

627
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,010
Ms. Qin's office

628
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,800
for many times.

629
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,760
She's either in a meeting,

630
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
or out of the office.

631
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,920
I suspect

632
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,150
they don't even want to work with us.

633
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,530
Give me the card.

634
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,800
Hi, I'm the director of
the Business Development Department

635
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,880
from Deer Sing Group, Lu Yiyao,

636
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,190
May I speak to Ms. Qin, please?

637
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,720
Hi. I'm so sorry.

638
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
Ms. Qin is out of the office currently.

639
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,530
Can I help you with anything?

640
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,920
May I take down your message?

641
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,750
I'll let her know when she gets back.

642
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,810
No, thanks.

643
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,770
Can't reach her, right?

644
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,160
I'll keep trying.

645
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,790
You'll have to reach her someday.

646
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,320
I don't believe Ms. Qin

647
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,450
could just disappear.

648
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,570
If you approve, director,

649
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,850
I'm gonna go to her company

650
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,320
and wait for her.

651
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,730
Director,

652
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,760
you and Ms. Qin have known each other
for years.

653
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,200
Don't you have her personal phone number?

654
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,280
She didn't pick up the calls
in the office.

655
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,690
Perhaps she'll answer her private calls.

656
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,090
This is business.

657
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,570
If she doesn't answer a business call,

658
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,760
she definitely won't answer private calls.

659
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,240
Stupid.

660
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,040
Hello.

661
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,320
It's me.

662
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,970
Lu Yiyao.

663
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,090
Director Lu.

664
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,630
I've been waiting for your call.

665
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,640
I'd like to meet you sometime.

666
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:07,840
And we could talk about

667
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,610
the cooperation between
Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

668
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,760
Okay.

669
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,520
Let's meet over lunch.

670
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,400
By the way,

671
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,390
I have one request.

672
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,010
Name it.

673
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,570
How romantic.

674
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,930
Isn't this Director Lu?

675
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,520
I never thought
he'd do something like this.

676
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,800
Look, so handsome.

677
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,320
Who's so lucky? He's so handsome.

678
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,570
Who's so lucky?

679
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm so jealous.

680
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,410
Learn from him, okay?

681
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,690
Flowers?

682
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,640
We're about to get into

683
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
the main storyline?

684
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,280
But,

685
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,160
why is he standing in the lobby

686
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,170
with two bouquets of flowers?

687
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,450
That's lovely.

688
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,970
I'm embarrassed.

689
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,130
How do you feel?

690
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,160
Standing in the lobby alone

691
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,320
with two bouquets of flowers,

692
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,370
isn't it good?

693
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,840
As long as you are happy.

694
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,690
However,

695
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,400
I don't like

696
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,170
this kind of flower anymore.

697
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,560
The colors are too boring.

698
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,640
It doesn't really go with me now.

699
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,640
Well, then,

700
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,720
what kind of flowers does Ms. Qin like?

701
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,920
I'll buy it next time.

702
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:42,920
Of course, you will.

703
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,450
Siyu, why you are still here?

704
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,840
Don't look at me. Just go.

705
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,090
Now, may I take Ms. Qin

706
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,280
for a meal now?

707
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,200
Of course.

708
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,280
Please.

709
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,600
Throw it away.

710
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,520
It's all right. Go eat.

711
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,720
Okay, bye.

712
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:36,680
What a waste.

713
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,919
Threw away such perfect flowers.

714
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:41,680
And the trash can downstairs

715
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,250
could only take dry waste.

716
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,640
I've done my bit

717
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,720
to keep our company clean.

718
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,169
That's basically the same as

719
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,129
you bought me flowers.

720
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,770
Cai Siyu,

721
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,040
who bought you flowers?

722
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
Come on.

723
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Didn't you go downstairs for lunch?

724
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,530
Did you go to buy flowers instead?

725
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,810
I just picked it up.

726
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,690
I see.

727
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,610
Who is so rich

728
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,160
to put such a bunch of flowers there

729
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,170
waiting for you to pick it up.

730
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,090
How was I supposed to know that?

731
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,280
Director Lu bought it.

732
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
Well, he's certainly rich.

733
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,970
You wouldn't admire Director Lu,

734
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,050
would you?

735
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,330
I...

736
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,970
Really?

737
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,810
-You...
-Alright, I admire him.

738
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,690
I admit that.

739
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,600
What? Can't I?

740
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,850
Of course, you can.

741
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,290
You're not the first one

742
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,330
and you won't be the last.

743
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,280
Don't take

744
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,400
hopeless things so seriously, okay?

745
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,730
Bye.

746
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,150
I'm just gonna be the last one.

747
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,040
For dessert,

748
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,840
we have mango pudding,

749
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,680
and chocolate mousse.

750
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,690
Which one do you prefer?

751
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,610
Mango pudding for two.

752
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,650
Alright, please give me a moment.

753
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,810
I know you like

754
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,490
mango pudding.

755
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,160
Yujiang,

756
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,280
Deer Sing needs
Jiang Cheng's production line.

757
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,720
These two companies

758
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,690
have been doing well together.

759
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,610
But, it has been a long time

760
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,890
and you still haven't signed the contract.

761
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,400
I want to know

762
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,250
what else do you want?

763
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,230
I'll move forward with the partnership.

764
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,800
-Okay.
-But,

765
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,880
you don't like

766
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,800
things you can get easily.

767
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,010
Besides this meal,

768
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,290
shouldn't you have something else

769
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,130
to offer?

770
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,800
The prices we set couldn't be changed.

771
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,120
Deer Sing can make certain compromises

772
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,850
to Jiang Cheng.

773
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,680
As soon as you come up with a plan,

774
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,320
we'll consider taking it.

775
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,970
We do need some new plans.

776
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,850
I understand that Jiang Cheng

777
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,990
hasn't got big projects

778
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,800
in recent years.

779
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,650
Deer Sing can ensure that

780
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,280
in the next few years,

781
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,330
you'll have a steady start-up rate.

782
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,080
A partnership like this

783
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,800
is a rare opportunity for you.

784
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,200
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

785
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,320
For you,

786
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm just a business partner?

787
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,570
I think

788
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,600
we're still friends.

789
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,640
You think?

790
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,130
Lu Yiyao, you've always thought

791
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,570
that you know me well.

792
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,850
There's so much

793
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,130
you don't know about me.

794
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,550
You don't know that

795
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,930
I never like mango pudding.

796
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,640
You don't know that I like flowers,

797
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,640
but I don't like your attitude
when you send me flowers.

798
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,520
You don't know where I am,

799
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,370
whether I'm busy or hungry.

800
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,680
You never care.

801
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,360
You were just following

802
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,480
your standards

803
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,400
and playing the perfect fiance.

804
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,090
Weren't you?

805
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,370
Excuse me, Director Lu.

806
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,410
I have an appointment today

807
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,560
with the Golden Horse Furniture.

808
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,810
Mr. Zhang's called me many times.

809
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,760
If I don't go, he'll feel offended.

810
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,210
You don't want
to offend anyone in business.

811
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,330
Yujiang.

812
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,170
I'll give it to you

813
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,210
whatever you want.

814
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,170
I don't want our relationship

815
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,970
to affect the cooperation

816
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:21,960
between Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

817
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,490
Infinity

818
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,320
is important to Fangning.

819
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,650
After all these years,

820
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,970
you still care about her so much.

821
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,240
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,010
Let's call off the engagement.

823
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,440
As long as you wish,

824
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,480
you could use any excuse
to tell the public.

825
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,600
The number you dialed is

827
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,080
busy now.

828
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,090
Sorry.

829
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,530
The number you dialed is

830
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,970
busy now.

831
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,240
Sorry.

832
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,570
The number you dialed is

833
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,010
busy now.

834
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,400
Please try again later.

835
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,410
Clean up the room.

836
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,560
Lu Yiyao and I

837
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,290
will cancel our engagement.

838
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,720
Lu Yiyao.

839
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,890
Why do you think

840
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,320
I can handle all of this?

841
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,110
Why should I have to

842
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,370
be decent and sensible?

843
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,090
It's unfair.

844
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,610
You're the only one who's calm.

845
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,410
Fangning.

846
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,760
Let's have dinner tonight.

847
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,810
Bring your husband along.

848
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,250
I didn't make it

849
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,360
to your wedding.

850
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,160
Think of it as a celebration.

851
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,970
Okay, see you tonight.
