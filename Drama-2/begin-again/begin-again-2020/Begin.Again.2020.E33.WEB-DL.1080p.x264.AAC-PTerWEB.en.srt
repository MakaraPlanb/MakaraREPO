[Begin Again]

3
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 33]

4
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,209
They all thought

5
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,140
I was greeting them.

6
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,530
The fight is already on.

7
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:57,770
Hello.

8
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,970
Hello.

9
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,580
Um...

10
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,650
Please sit.

11
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,370
After you.

12
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,770
Just sit down together.

13
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,620
[I'm fair and impartial.]

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,890
[This is a brilliant idea.]

15
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,490
This is Peng Bo,

16
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,890
a doctor at the city hospital.

17
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,770
This is Shen Zhuo,

18
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,050
his family sells soy sauce.

19
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,010
Now he's a furniture designer.

20
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,450
-Hello.
-Hello.

21
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,180
-Hello.
-Hello.

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,529
You're Dr. Peng, right?

23
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:26,610
Which department?

24
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,890
I'm a surgeon.

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660
[A preemptive strike?]

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,090
[I should follow then.]

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,970
Mr. Shen,

28
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,490
I wonder how you and Miss Pingping

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,820
got to know each other?

30
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,450
Me and Lu Fangning

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,540
were college classmates.

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,210
Tang Ping,

33
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,330
she and Lu Fangning...

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,930
[A formidable foe.]

35
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,450
[Now he's testing]

36
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,650
[my relationship with Tang Ping.]

37
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,690
You don't have to know about

38
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,690
my relationship with Lu Fangning.

39
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,410
I've only known

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,610
Tang Ping for a while.

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,730
But I know her very well.

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,810
That's enough.

43
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,490
[The man the sister-in-law approves.]

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,570
[He should be reliable.]

45
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,610
Mr. Shen, you know Lu Fangning.

46
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,690
[I wonder if you know Ling Rui?]

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,850
Dr. Ling, right?

48
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,410
Lu Fangning's ex...

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,410
Excellent and priceless husband.

50
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,450
Yes, yes.

51
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,170
Well,

52
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,330
he's a doctor, and so are you.

53
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,970
So...

54
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,730
do you know him?

55
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,970
We are colleagues at the same hospital.

56
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,740
Besides, we have been good friends

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,650
since childhood.

58
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,490
[A friend that even Ling Rui trusts.]

59
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,490
[He must be reliable.]

60
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,130
[An intense start.]

61
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,290
[I know.

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,930
[They want to pry on each other's background.]

63
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,860
[To let me...]

64
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,340
You know,

65
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,890
Miss Pingping is a public figure.

66
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,810
Sometimes it's not so convenient.

67
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,010
So please...

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,330
Mr. Shen, please be considerate.

69
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,500
Of course, certainly.

70
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,290
Well,

71
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,730
just "Shen Zhuo" will do.

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,490
Okay.

73
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,450
Allow me to introduce myself again.

74
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,690
I am the president of

75
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,930
Miss Pingping's fan club.

76
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,490
The president of her fan club?

77
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,330
Yes, yes.

78
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,300
Then you can surely understand her.

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,970
She's just

80
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,570
a little bit...

81
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,140
Forget about this.

82
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,290
She's nice.

83
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,010
Yes, it's good for you to understand that.

84
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,060
Besides, you need to tolerate her.

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,450
[They are praising me.]

86
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,020
[Good guys.]

87
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,810
Well,

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,650
about her relationship,

89
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,050
fans like us

90
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,770
can't intervene.

91
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,050
She can do whatever she pleases.

92
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,650
Right.

93
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,820
I'm wondering why she asked for my advice.

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,290
Right?

95
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,740
Does my opinion even matter?

96
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,050
I'm not saying I'm not satisfied with you.

97
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,140
Don't get me wrong.

98
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,420
I mean,

99
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,650
she likes you, and you like her.

100
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,729
You mean...

101
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:29,690
"you" like her?

102
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,610
Yes, you like her.

103
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,250
"You" like her?

104
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,130
Yeah, you like her.

105
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,500
I'm glad you two like me.

106
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,130
We?

107
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,690
You?

108
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,810
So you asked both of us here,

109
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,450
just to fix us up with each other?

110
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,460
No, Miss Pingping.

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,650
You got it all wrong.

112
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,810
Explain it

113
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,570
to your girlfriend.

114
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,890
Isn't her your girlfriend?

115
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,170
Doesn't he like you?

116
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,850
Not him?

117
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,810
Don't you both like me?

118
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,540
[It's a war of three.]

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,020
[I can't be the one to call the shots.]

120
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,090
[This saying is so philosophical.]

121
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,330
When did I say I like you?

122
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,650
You said Lu Fangning was crazy

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,609
and a liar.

124
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,090
You said I was sweet and cute,

125
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,930
lively and considerate.

126
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,770
It's not like there were

127
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,740
no other women left.

128
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,580
If that was the case,

129
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,330
I'd rather be single

130
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,330
my entire life.

131
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,010
How about you?

132
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,930
Do you like me?

133
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,450
I...

134
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,780
Sure.

135
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,490
That's good.

136
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,610
I allow you to...

137
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,490
Miss Pingping,

138
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,090
I like you,

139
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,850
but considering your status,

140
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,370
I don't deserve you.

141
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,890
What do you mean?

142
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,730
He means,

143
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,450
his feelings for you are

144
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,290
what a fan would have towards his idol.

145
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,570
It's not romantic.

146
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,290
Right?

147
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,060
Yes.

148
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,330
You!

149
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,250
But...

150
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,090
This is too much!

151
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,210
You two should date each other!

152
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,490
You're meant for each other!

153
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,730
That was too mean!

154
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,650
Miss Pingping, calm down!

155
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,420
You have a love scene

156
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,730
in a few days!

157
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,730
Damn it, can she even perform well

158
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,210
for the scene?

159
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,420
I bet the director

160
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,330
will yell at her again.

161
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,770
I'm sorry, Ms. Lu.

162
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,930
I'm afraid we can't sign the contract.

163
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,490
But...

164
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,170
I...

165
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,690
I don't understand. This is too sudden.

166
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,650
I'm really sorry.

167
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,250
Mr. Cao,

168
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,130
because our previous partnership

169
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,780
was very pleasant.

170
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,810
So our products

171
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,210
are now arriving

172
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,610
and on display.

173
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,570
If you suddenly

174
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,530
end the partnership now,

175
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,490
it's really hard for me to accept.

176
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,570
About this park,

177
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,290
we were supposed to design

178
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,410
and operate it.

179
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,730
But it actually

180
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,380
belongs to another company.

181
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,690
They ordered us

182
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,570
not to let your brand in.

183
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,450
Otherwise, the rent of the entire park

184
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,850
will be raised.

185
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,330
Ms. Lu,

186
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,530
if they raise the rent,

187
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,890
it will be hard for us

188
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,940
to explain to the other businesses.

189
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,730
May I know

190
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,210
which company it was?

191
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,090
Ming Cheng Development.

192
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,530
Okay, I got it.

193
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,770
She thought I liked her?

194
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,420
Lu Fangning's friend is weird.

195
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,330
Are we going in now?

196
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,650
How bad should we make it?

197
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,690
The boss ordered us

198
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,010
to give them a warning.

199
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,940
Just make sure they close down the business.

200
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,890
Hello.

201
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,330
We're not open for business yet.

202
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,210
What can I do for you?

203
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,370
Just looking around.

204
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,450
What kind of

205
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,530
delicate trinkets are you selling?

206
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,530
Don't kick it.

207
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,090
You're trashing our store!

208
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,700
This is pretty solid.

209
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,370
We're here

210
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,330
to stop you from opening the store.

211
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,010
I'm warning you.

212
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,730
You can't even open a shop around here.

213
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,090
Pack your stuff and leave.

214
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,130
Who are you?

215
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,050
I'll call the police unless you leave.

216
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,090
The police?

217
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,009
What are you doing?

218
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,100
-Stop it!
-Don't move.

219
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,050
Stop it!

220
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,530
What are you doing? Don't do that!

221
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:53,890
Stop.

222
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,850
Stop it!

223
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,890
Don't move.

224
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,290
Don't scratch it!

225
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,570
Let me go!

226
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,650
-Don't move, -Let me go!

227
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,450
Run!

228
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,330
Are you okay?

229
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,690
What happened?

230
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,410
What happened here?

231
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,250
I don't know where

232
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,130
those two bastards came from.

233
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,650
They broke our lights.

234
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,850
The table was scratched.

235
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,730
I tried to stop them.

236
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,970
Look, my hand is hurt.

237
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,130
Are you okay?

238
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,900
-I'm fine.
-Can you still move?

239
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,410
Try moving it.

240
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,460
Maybe it was hurt earlier.

241
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,330
Now it's got worse.

242
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,940
Be careful.

243
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,810
I'll take you to a hospital

245
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,090
for a checkup.

246
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,970
Any idea who did this?

247
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,490
I don't know.

248
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,130
They must think they were action stars.

249
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,700
They came in and said,

250
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,290
"Don't ever open a shop here again."

251
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,460
I'll call the police now.

252
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,210
Shen Zhuo.

253
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,020
Shen Zhuo.

254
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,860
What's wrong?

255
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,770
Mr. Cao just called off

256
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,810
the partnership.

257
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,220
They terminated the contract.

258
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,610
This can't be a coincidence.

259
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,210
Was it Mr. Cao's doing?

260
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,810
Am I imagining things?

261
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,970
Who would be mean enough to do that?

262
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,370
Give me a hint.

263
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,650
Shen Zhuo,

264
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,410
stay here for a while.

265
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,850
I'll take you to a hospital later.

266
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,250
I'll come back later.

267
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,140
Send me to the hospital now!

268
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,340
You can't go in there, miss.

269
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,570
Mr. Gao.

270
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,740
That's fine.

271
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,580
Leave us.

272
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,730
Okay.

273
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,170
You are trespassing the general manager's office.

274
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,850
Lu Fangning,

275
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,740
you don't own the place.

276
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,690
Mr. Gao, you don't seem surprised

277
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,450
by my arrival.

278
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,850
You're revisiting this place.

279
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,610
You want to see how well the company you worked for

280
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,490
has become.

281
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,770
It's normal.

282
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,300
Since you and I

283
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,090
have worked together once.

284
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,060
I

285
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,970
don't mind wasting a little time

286
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,090
to show you

287
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,090
the current Lu Sing

288
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,090
and how well it develops.

289
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,850
Gao Erfan,

290
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,730
six years ago, my dad and I

291
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,090
left the company to you.

292
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,810
We weren't afraid of you

293
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,050
or defeated by you.

294
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,410
It was because I knew

295
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,010
a fight to the death

296
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,290
against you

297
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,330
will end up with me

298
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,930
ruining the lives

299
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,100
of ordinary people.

300
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,650
So I chose not to back out.

301
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,850
That sounds ridiculous.

302
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,100
Ming Cheng Development

303
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,210
has been Lu Sing's

304
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,210
partner for years.

305
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,490
You used them to threaten the park

306
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,500
into breaking the contract

307
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,930
and sent some thugs

308
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,490
to the trash in my store.

309
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,090
While I've been away,

310
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,130
you've stooped very low.

311
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,340
I didn't realize

312
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,730
you would sink so low

313
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,370
and resort to petty tricks.

314
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,650
Lu Fangning,

315
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,970
please don't take it out on me

316
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,330
because you failed

317
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,890
to open a business.

318
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,730
Do you think that

319
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,450
you are the most pitiful

320
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,330
and the greatest man alive?

321
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,610
Should everyone

322
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,250
play along

323
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,490
with your emotional drama?

324
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,380
Yes.

325
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,450
I'm not like you.

326
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,050
Whether it's your company, your family,

327
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,730
or your lover,

328
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,170
you never hesitate to give up.

329
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,210
Losing Infinity didn't bother you at all.

330
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,370
You could always

331
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,130
start a new business if you felt like it.

332
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,450
All the things you've lost

333
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,930
came back to you in the end.

334
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,410
Ling Rui never stopped waiting

335
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,530
for your change of heart!

336
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,490
I am not pitiful.

337
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,290
But Lu Yue was.

338
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,180
Because I'm the only one who remembers her.

339
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,090
What?

340
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,010
Did it hit a little too close to home?

341
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,820
Did that make you speechless?

342
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,660
I will never forget her.

343
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,140
Never.

344
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,490
You're lying.

345
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,220
What can I do

346
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,610
to make you believe me?

347
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,730
Should I blame myself

348
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,890
and dwell on the past?

349
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,690
Everything you said was about my sister.

350
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,610
Do you know how to love her?

351
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,810
Do you know

352
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,460
what her greatest wish is?

353
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,890
I believe

354
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,690
I know Lu Yue better than you do.

355
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,420
Let me tell you

356
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,290
what she really wanted.

357
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,450
She would never hope

358
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,620
for any of us

359
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,570
to get trapped by guilt

360
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,690
and give up our own life.

361
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,010
Every year on my birthday,

362
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,260
she would tell me,

363
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,330
"I hope you can

364
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,530
do whatever you want with your life,

365
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,890
and be whoever you want to be."

366
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,130
If...

367
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,250
If she could celebrate...

368
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,890
one more birthday with me,

369
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,170
I'm sure she would...

370
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,050
-say...
-Enough.

371
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,250
Lu Fangning,

372
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,890
stop making excuses for yourself.

373
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,370
Gao Erfan,

374
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,660
you're the man my sister loved the most.

375
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,820
I don't want you to have only

376
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,090
painful memories

377
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,580
when you're thinking of my sister.

378
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,690
I'll leave when I'm done,

379
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,690
and I won't stop you

380
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,620
if you keep seeking revenge on me.

381
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,370
But I warn you.

382
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,850
You can make it personal,

383
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,410
but don't get others involved.

384
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,530
Most of them in the art park

385
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,130
are all ordinary business owners.

386
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,010
They stand no chance against your massive firm.

387
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,540
If you insist on doing this,

388
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,810
I will play along with you.

389
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,930
Youyou.

390
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,170
Are you reading?

391
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,010
Yes.

392
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,450
-Dad.
-Yes.

393
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,620
Mom,

394
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,330
how's she?

395
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,250
Your mom...

396
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,010
Your mom is a little tired.

397
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,210
She went to bed.

398
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,570
Maybe...

399
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
I could read you a story,

400
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,690
okay?

401
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,770
Okay.

402
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,090
Where were you at?

403
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,930
Here.

404
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,020
Okay.

405
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,740
Sister Bear asks her dad,

406
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,570
"Dad,

407
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,610
do we have tree rings too?"

408
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,220
Papa Bear

409
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,050
tells Sister Bear,

410
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,580
"We don't have it.

411
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,330
But,

412
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,210
we have a better thing to celebrate.

413
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,780
Our birthdays.

414
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,930
We can have a birthday party."

415
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,930
Birthday?

416
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,170
What's wrong, Dad?

417
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,290
Have you got anything on your mind?

418
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,970
I just remembered

419
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,530
something about birthdays.

420
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,810
Are you wondering

421
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,890
how to celebrate my birthday?

422
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,250
But I'm very considerate.

423
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,660
I won't ask for too many gifts or anything expensive.

424
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,090
Good boy.

425
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,170
Dad,

426
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,340
I want to tell you a secret.

427
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,809
What's the secret?

428
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,170
Before my birthday,

429
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,130
mom's birthday is just around the corner.

430
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,059
Remember

431
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,380
not to celebrate her birthday.

432
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,090
Otherwise, I can't celebrate mine.

433
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,529
I know.

434
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,569
But you should have told me sooner.

435
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,170
Is it too late?

436
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,340
Yes.

437
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,050
It's six years too late.

438
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,210
Dad,

439
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,850
did you know that six years ago?

440
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,460
Morning.

441
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,330
Morning.

442
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,290
Well?

443
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,540
Did you sleep well?

444
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,810
In the beginning,

445
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,850
I was a little restless.

446
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,290
But then I slept soundly.

447
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,420
This is a lot. Let's dig in.

448
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,610
I didn't have enough yesterday.

449
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,610
I'm starving,

450
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,090
Is it not for me?

451
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,420
So none of it

452
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,370
is for me?

453
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,570
You must first promise me three things.

454
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,530
That's a lot.

455
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,970
Forget it then.

456
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,300
Just three things.

457
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,810
Go ahead, what?

458
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,130
First,

459
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,620
I'll be honest with you

460
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,010
about everything in the future.

461
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,010
I hope you will be the same.

462
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,370
Don't hide anything from me.

463
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,850
Trust me.

464
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,850
I promise.

465
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,210
Secondly,

466
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,530
when should we

467
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,820
get our marriage certificate?

468
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,980
When I first came back to China,

469
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,020
I couldn't find you.

470
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,500
To force you to show up,

471
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,010
I went to court

472
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,370
and filed for divorce.

473
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,250
But you hid too well.

474
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,130
You didn't show up.

475
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,490
The court made the divorce effective.

476
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,850
You wouldn't think that

477
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,730
we just need to live together

478
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,890
to take care of Youyou

479
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,260
after I said we got back together.

480
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,770
In view of your previous credit,

481
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,290
I need the protection of the law.

482
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,970
-Otherwise...
-Yeah, I know.

483
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,650
I can totally understand that.

484
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,250
No problem.

485
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,770
Then...

486
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,340
What's the third thing?

487
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,530
Thirdly,

488
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,570
I love you,

489
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,250
Lu Fangning.

490
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,370
The three words we owed to each other.

491
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,570
I love you.

492
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,490
It doesn't matter.

493
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,730
If you can't say it now,

494
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,490
you won't have any breakfast.

495
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,420
Youyou.

496
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,650
Ling Rui.

497
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,250
I love you.

498
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,810
I love you.

499
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,770
You're the person

500
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,780
I love the most.

501
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,930
I saw nothing.

502
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,570
Well...

503
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,610
Let's finish the breakfast.

504
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,610
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

505
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,620
♫ All I want is to be with you ♫

506
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,170
♫ I've never wanted to escape from the palm of your hand ♫

507
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,010
♫ Holding on to the past and present ♫

508
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:14,500
♫ And our future ♫

509
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,010
Why are you here again?

510
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,810
What are you doing here?

511
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,050
I...

512
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,410
If you're here

513
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,450
to ask the question

514
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,250
from six years ago...

515
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,450
Since I've said it many times

516
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,890
yet you're still skeptical,

517
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,290
then there is only one solution left.

518
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,250
That is...

519
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,370
Let's try again.

520
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,900
Let's recreate the scene.

521
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,690
If you're here to repeat

522
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,890
the boring question,

523
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,690
now you can get up

524
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,580
and walk ten steps forward.

525
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,370
Open the door, close the door, and leave.

526
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,290
Keep a safe distance.

527
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,410
No.

528
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,730
I'm not here to ask you the question.

529
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,730
I came to ask you

530
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,290
about your progress on the novel.

531
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,010
It goes very well.

532
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,170
You haven't updated for three days.

533
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,140
So you came here asking for an update?

534
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,330
Well...

535
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,130
Use me.

536
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,130
Didn't you want to use me

537
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,660
to inspire your passion?

538
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,810
So I came here in person.

539
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,010
You can use me as you please.

540
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,410
Use me to inspire your passion

541
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,820
for the pinnacle of your creativity.

542
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,650
How's that?

543
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,730
You want me to use you.

544
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,730
Okay.

545
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,530
Here's the deal.

546
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,570
We only

547
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,050
talk about the plot, nothing else.

548
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,930
Okay.

549
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,410
Let me tell you

550
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,250
the plot of the novel.

551
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,490
Try to feel it.

552
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,370
Here's the story.

553
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,290
I know.

554
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,930
You know?

555
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,690
The bossy president's

556
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,650
mysterious son

557
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,650
met the female protagonist

558
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,570
and never let her go.

559
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,010
It was a fascinating plot,

560
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,890
but you summed it up in one sentence?

561
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,700
And then?

562
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,010
Actually,

563
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,770
the child

564
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,770
is the kid of two main protagonists.

565
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,170
But the female protagonist

566
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,490
doesn't know the man.

567
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,460
Where did the baby come from?

568
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,380
Do you really want to know?

569
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,890
I bet you can't guess it.

570
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,370
I'll give you a sneak peek.

571
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,930
Here's the previous plot.

572
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,930
The president

573
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,330
was with a woman he loved deeply

574
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,490
who suffered leukemia.

575
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,530
This woman

576
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,690
had a long-lost

577
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,210
biological sister.

578
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,090
The sister is the female protagonist.

579
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,820
In a word,

580
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,450
the president went through a great ordeal

581
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,890
to find this woman.

582
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,020
He tricked her into loving him

583
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,700
so she could give him a child.

584
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,180
He would use this baby's

585
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,610
umbilical cord blood

586
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,210
to save the woman he loved.

587
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,490
But surprisingly,

588
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,210
the female protagonist

589
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,420
learned the truth

590
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,770
on the day the baby was born.

591
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,690
Her heart was shattered.

592
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,850
So...

593
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,340
So?

594
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,090
Then,

595
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,530
she lost her memories.

596
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,250
Because extreme heartbreak

597
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,260
erased all her memories

598
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,140
about the president.

599
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,570
Isn't this man awful?

600
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,730
It's written in your image.

601
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,570
I just wrote about their reunion.

602
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,010
Facing the female protagonist who lost her memories,

603
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,100
what shall the president

604
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,490
do the next?

605
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,530
Will he hide the truth?

606
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,530
Or maybe

607
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,730
he will approach her with ill intent?

608
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,580
[Head-on tactics won't work on her.]

609
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,340
[Simply defending won't do me any good.]

610
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,090
[I'll improvise.]

611
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,530
Stay here.

612
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,850
The plot of your novel

613
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,290
stopped at this action, right?

614
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,130
Right.

615
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,860
Shall we give it a try

616
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,770
and find out what happens next?

617
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,650
Parcel delivery.

618
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,570
Leave it at the doorstep.

619
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,540
You...

620
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,690
I...

621
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,090
Did you get any inspiration?

622
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,570
Yes, you can leave now.

623
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,850
Don't kick me out

624
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,170
the moment you got the inspiration.

625
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,370
I have other ideas.

626
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,210
Come on, sit.

627
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,890
No. I want to be creative.

628
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,930
Let's talk about it next time.

629
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,050
Next time.

630
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,580
Next time?

631
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,450
Really?

632
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,130
Really, I mean it.

633
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,610
Don't forget.

634
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,610
Tang Ping is here.

635
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:45,890
Later on,

636
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,500
you'll sit in his back seat.

637
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,930
You'll ride on his bike.

638
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,060
Here's the route.

639
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,170
From here to there.

640
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,010
Then go there.

641
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,170
I thought it was a bus.

642
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,410
A bus? Forget it.

643
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,340
It's too tedious.

644
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,450
A bike will do.

645
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,290
My love

646
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,860
is only worthy of a bike.

647
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,020
You're not looking good today.

648
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,770
You're supposed

649
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,090
to play as

650
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,100
a woman in love.

651
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,050
You're not up for the job.

652
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,570
A woman...

653
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,410
in love?

654
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,140
Look.

655
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,130
Show me your smile.

656
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,250
Why is she crying?

657
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,250
Tang Ping,

658
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,010
I asked you to show

659
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,900
the feeling of being in love.

660
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,010
What are you showing me?

661
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,730
She had waited a long time

662
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,010
for such a scene.

663
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,490
The cold wind.

664
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,090
The chill rain.

665
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,290
Tang Ping

666
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,570
What's the matter?

667
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,050
Brother,

668
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,580
please explain to them.

669
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,930
Tang Ping is experiencing

670
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,010
various states of love.

671
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,890
This is the only way

672
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,580
to make her feel

673
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,570
the sweetness of love.

674
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,100
What kind of acting is this?

675
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,370
Forget about her method.

676
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,690
Talk to the director.

677
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,300
Get me half an hour.

678
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,890
Who are you?

679
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,930
I'm a paramedic.

680
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,770
What was that about?

681
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,570
Director.

682
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,050
Please wait for a while.

683
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,610
She'll definitely be here soon.

684
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,490
Do me a favor.

685
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,170
Assistant director.

686
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,130
Director.

687
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,140
Where did you get this actress?

688
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,250
Did you tell her about the plot?

689
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,290
Can she still do it or not?

690
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,250
Yes, she can.

691
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,810
She'll be right here.

692
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,970
Leave.

693
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,700
Let's take a break.

694
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,450
Have some rest.

695
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,360
Are we calling it a day?

696
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,220
How long are we going to wait?

697
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,480
-I'm so sorry.
-Can we have an exact time frame?

698
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,000
It's almost done.

699
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,730
When you cry like that,

700
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,370
I'll in a bad mood.

701
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,530
That's the end.

702
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,410
Wait!

703
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,850
Isn't that the paramedic?

704
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,170
Brother,

705
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,090
go ask the director.

706
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,620
We'll be done soon.

707
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,090
Okay.

708
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,540
Then I'll just

709
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,850
leave Pingping to you two.

710
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,860
Okay.

711
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,090
Good luck.

712
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,490
Director.

713
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,730
You two...

714
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,770
This is for you.

715
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,730
This is for you.

716
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,250
What do you mean?

717
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,330
We are wooing you.

718
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,300
I want to win your love.

719
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,930
You said you didn't like me.

720
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,690
We went back

721
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,500
and thought it through.

722
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,050
I think you're

723
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,450
a really good girl.

724
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,010
And you're pretty, right?

725
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,780
You're gorgeous.

726
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,570
And...

727
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,330
You're innocent.

728
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,620
Nowadays,

729
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,010
girls like you are hard to come by.

730
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,530
Do you think so, Shen Zhuo?

731
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,170
Yes, beautiful and innocent.

732
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,410
Lovely.

733
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,690
Lovely.

734
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,290
Enough.

735
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,170
I'm not saying that

736
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,850
I accept you two.

737
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,860
I mean...

738
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,490
I have to work.

739
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,290
Yes, that's good. Carry on.

740
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,770
Are you sure you're up for the job?

741
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,210
Yes.

742
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,370
I should get back to work.

743
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,770
Let's talk about this when I'm back.

744
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,290
The feeling of love.

745
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,770
The breeze.

746
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,090
The petals.

747
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,250
That's the effect.

748
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,170
I'm sure she won't fail again this time.

749
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,980
Unbelievable.

750
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,860
Where are you going?

751
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,210
I'm sorry.

752
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,890
Nature calls.

753
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,770
What the hell?

754
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,010
What are they up to?

755
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,730
She said,

756
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,410
"I'm glad you like me,

757
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,010
but don't fight over me."

758
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,090
Yeah, that's the smile.

759
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,450
Why not use a mirror instead?

760
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,100
Shen Zhuo.

761
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,780
You scared me.

762
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,530
What are you doing here?

763
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,700
Aren't you working?

764
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,220
It's done. I passed on the first try.

765
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,460
Congratulations.

766
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,330
Are you leaving?

767
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,580
Don't you want to know the answer?

768
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,130
What?

769
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,940
Where are my flowers?

770
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,410
My flowers.

771
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,450
I'm too busy. I'll give it to you next time.

772
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,580
I mean, later.

773
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,010
Well...

774
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,940
Peng Bo is over there. Go find him.

775
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:29,820
You.

776
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,730
Hey!

777
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:31,900
What's going

778
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,940
with you two?

779
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,570
What? What do you mean?

780
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,460
Just as you saw

781
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,130
just now.

782
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,140
We both

783
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,890
like you.

784
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,130
I'm not stupid.

785
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,610
All right.

786
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,410
I admit

787
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,210
I can be silly at times.

788
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,660
However,

789
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,130
on this kind of matter,

790
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,850
I don't want to

791
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,890
make the same mistake.

792
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,650
So you were putting up an act?

793
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,700
Not really.

794
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,380
Half of it was real.

795
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,170
Actually, I'm worried

796
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,570
I can't do well in love scenes.

797
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,930
You two just happened to be here.

798
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,490
So I use the chance for practice.

799
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,420
Don't change the topic.

800
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,770
Be honest with me.

801
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,290
If you don't tell me,

802
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,770
I'll tell Lu Fangning

803
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,210
you skipped your work

804
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,850
and came to me.

805
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,050
-I'll ask her to cut your pay.
-Stop.

806
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,089
Stop!

807
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,410
You're so annoying.

808
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,890
You all threatened me with her.

809
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,770
To tell you the truth,

810
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm not afraid of Lu Fangning at all.

811
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,970
So,

812
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,540
are you afraid of me?

813
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,410
If you don't say it,

814
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,689
I'll take this as you like me.

815
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,649
I'll choose you.

816
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:36,770
I'll pass.

817
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,649
Okay, I'll tell you.

818
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,899
Peng Bo noticed you've been in a bad mood.

819
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,089
He wanted to cheer you up.

820
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,330
So he dragged me

821
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,210
into doing this.

822
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,339
Peng Bo?

823
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,580
Why did he do that?

824
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:50,060
How do I know that?

825
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,339
Maybe he was too bored.

826
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,410
Or maybe he likes you a lot.

827
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,850
He likes me?

828
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,540
Yes.

829
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,930
He likes you.

830
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:58,970
When he came to me for help,

831
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,740
I asked him,

832
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,250
"Do you like Tang Ping?"

833
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,730
He didn't even think about it

834
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,089
and denied.

835
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,450
Then he doesn't like me.

836
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,810
You don't understand.

837
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,090
Trust me.

838
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,820
Psychologically speaking,

839
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,250
the faster he answers,

840
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,810
the more he tries to hide.

841
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,970
It was the reality

842
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,810
he wouldn't dare to face.

843
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,450
If he likes me,

844
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,690
why he doesn't tell me?

845
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,330
That's...

846
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,850
Self-abashment.

847
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,170
Self-abashment?

848
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,610
Think about it.

849
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,020
You are so beautiful and lovely.

850
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,410
You're a superstar.

851
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,210
He is just

852
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,490
a little doctor at a small hospital.

853
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,450
He wouldn't dare

854
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,650
to admit he likes you.

855
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,220
He was afraid you wouldn't

856
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,930
see him as a friend if you knew this.

857
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,610
Or...

858
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,850
Maybe he couldn't even

859
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,890
be your fan.

860
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,810
That's why he used

861
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,890
this convoluted method

862
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,650
to cheer you up.

863
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,930
Is that true?

864
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,490
Why would I lie?

865
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,450
You know very well

866
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,170
how he treats you.

867
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,220
Can't you feel it?

868
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,490
Don't thank me.

869
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,650
Take care of yourself.

870
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,850
You did a great job just now.

871
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,850
The director praised you.

872
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,290
Now,

873
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,890
I finally got the courage

874
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,810
to get you some

875
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,970
romance scenes.

876
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,690
Who is he?

877
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,660
He's the one who asked me to give you

878
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,450
half an hour

879
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,690
to relax.

880
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,020
I didn't expect it would work.

881
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,850
He talked to me.

882
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,290
He knows you pretty well.

883
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,090
Of course.

884
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,330
Who is he to you?

885
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,570
He looks handsome.

886
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,570
Have some water.

887
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,170
Set aside the romance dramas.

888
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,930
I think

889
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,930
you'd better make a plan now.

890
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,530
Plan it through.

891
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,050
If I fell in love

892
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,050
and people found out,

893
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,730
how would you handle the PR crisis?

894
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,170
PR crisis?

895
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,260
Falling in love?

896
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,610
Peng Bo.

897
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,860
What are you doing?

898
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,850
Well...

899
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,650
I'm checking on

900
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,130
the shooting site of the crew

901
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,060
to find you something

902
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,050
you can make use of.

903
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,050
Don't worry, Miss Pingping.

904
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,890
I won't disclose anything

905
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,210
about the crew.

906
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,370
I totally trust you.

907
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,650
I made a decision.

908
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,850
I allow you to be my boyfriend.

909
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,050
I mean

910
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,370
I allow you to be my boyfriend.

911
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,770
What about Shen Zhuo?

912
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,610
Shen Zhuo?

913
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,410
He is already an adult.

914
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,010
He will treat this matter

915
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,090
rationally.

916
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,450
Don't worry about him.

917
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,850
I'll protect you.

918
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,250
I won't worry.

919
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,620
What's with that attitude?

920
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,970
Didn't you say you liked me?

921
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,770
I do like you.

922
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,900
That's enough.

923
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,930
Give it to me.

924
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,930
I love it.

925
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,490
In a few days,

926
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,330
it's Lu Fangning's birthday.

927
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,050
I want to celebrate her birthday at home

928
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,060
and invite all her friends.

929
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,770
So,

930
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,610
I may need your help.

931
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,370
Are you sure you want to celebrate her birthday?

932
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,090
I believe she overcame it.

933
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,770
And,

934
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,730
I hope this day

935
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,450
can give her a different meaning.

936
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,010
Okay.

937
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,250
Any advice on the matter?

938
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,220
Peng Bo?

939
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,330
Okay. Anything will do.

940
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,090
What are you talking about?

941
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,890
Anything is fine?

942
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,010
Can you be serious?

943
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,330
I've sent everything I need

944
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,570
for the birthday party

945
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,970
to your phones.

946
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,050
Take a look.

947
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,050
Never mind.

948
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,600
[Shopping list for Lu Fangning's birthday]

949
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,850
I'll handle the decoration.

950
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,490
Leave the rest to Curly.

951
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,130
Do I know you

952
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:25,810
that well?

953
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,290
Who allowed you to call me "Curly?"

954
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,170
Ling Rui,

955
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,980
are you throwing a birthday party

956
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,820
or a wedding?

957
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,090
They are pretty much the same.

958
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,770
It seems like you prepared

959
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,140
a grand present.

960
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,890
Are you going to pack yourself

961
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,900
as the present

962
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,250
for her?

963
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,650
I want to propose to her

964
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,220
at the birthday party.

965
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,740
After all, she did it last time.

966
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,650
This could be

967
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,250
a surprise for her birthday.

968
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,530
You finally got it straight.

969
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,100
It's been years.

970
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,140
I bet she will

971
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,650
cry in your arms.

972
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,700
Why would Fangning cry?

973
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,290
Don't be silly.

974
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,650
Listen to me.

975
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,850
At most,

976
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,290
Fangning would say,

977
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,690
"I'll give you all the money

978
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,170
I earned and will earn

979
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,690
in the past and in the future."

980
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,770
Will she really like it?

981
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,210
Of course.

982
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,610
What are you worrying about?

983
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,730
All women like surprises.

984
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,420
I just once had

985
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,930
a bad experience.

986
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,250
So,

987
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,930
I was a little concerned.

988
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,330
Don't worry.

989
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,690
Trust me.

990
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,970
You don't have to prepare anything.

991
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,250
You need nothing.

992
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,250
Cooperate with me.

993
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,970
Look carefully.

994
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,650
Go straight to her.

995
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,890
Put your arms around her waist.

996
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,770
My waist is not yours to hold.

997
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,500
Listen,

998
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,690
I've hurt my waist before.

999
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,490
If I got hurt,

1000
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,410
I'd go to you at the hospital.

1001
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,500
Don't blame me for your waist.

1002
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,140
Okay?

1003
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,380
Sit down and talk.

1004
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,930
-He pushed me.
-Okay, enough.

1005
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,250
Sit down.

1006
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,650
Let's continue.

1007
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,890
Run over to her,

1008
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,890
holding her waist, and say,

1009
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,290
"Fangning,

1010
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,810
marry me.

1011
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,220
Promise me.

1012
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,770
I don't have a second choice."

1013
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,770
Perfect.

1014
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,170
Perfect.

1015
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,610
You can surely succeed.

1016
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,650
Come on,

1017
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,580
did you learn this

1018
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,170
from online novels?

1019
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,210
You should save this

1020
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,010
for

1021
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,250
when you propose.

1022
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,290
I'll pass.

1023
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,330
If I propose...

1024
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,460
The success rate will be low.

1025
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,330
See?

1026
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,340
You knew it wouldn't work,

1027
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,050
and you asked him to follow your advice.

1028
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,300
Listen, Ling Rui.

1029
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,650
You have to make it lively,

1030
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,380
and romantic.

1031
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,170
Have everybody

1032
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,730
witness your wedding together.

1033
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,050
I have an idea.

1034
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,220
Ask all the people who come

1035
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,490
to hold up the same sign

1036
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,770
and shout the same cheer.

1037
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:43,930
All of them will witness

1038
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,620
your love.

1039
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,140
Isn't that a plot from love novels?

1040
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,690
It's like a fan meeting.

1041
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,130
What's wrong with a fan meeting?

1042
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,890
You know what?

1043
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,730
I tried it, it worked.

1044
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,330
Don't be absurd? Cut it out.

1045
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,530
Hold the sign alone

1046
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,010
and waving it

1047
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,130
looks too silly!

1048
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,490
Are you mocking me?

1049
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,090
Am I the only fool here?

1050
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:58,900
It's the 21st century.

1051
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,650
Your bossy style won't work.

1052
00:41:59,650 --> 00:41:59,980
What?

1053
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,610
What's wrong?

1054
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,690
-But...
-Look, your suit and tie.

1055
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,410
How dare you come out

1056
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,130
wearing like a clown.

1057
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,530
It's fashion.

1058
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,250
-Look at the shirt.
-Okay, okay.

1059
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,130
These are casual pants.

1060
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,450
Don't listen to him, listen to me.

1061
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,410
-Ignore him. Mine will work.
-You...

1062
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,050
Stay aside.

1063
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:10,900
What are you doing?

1064
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:11,940
Do you want a fight?

1065
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,250
Come on.

1066
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,010
I'll break your waist.

1067
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,820
-Bring it on!
-Sit down.
