[Episode 31]

4
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,530
Youyou.

5
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,130
Youyou?

6
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,450
[I took Youyou]

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,360
[to my mom's house.]

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,250
[Pick him up tomorrow morning.]

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,610
Youyou is not here.

10
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,600
[Fangning,]

11
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,770
[let's make it work this time.]

12
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,600
[We'll start over.]

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,130
[Youyou is our kid,]

14
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,530
[the eternal bond between us.]

15
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,730
[I will always be]

16
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,850
[part of your life.]

17
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,810
Starting over?

18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,410
Was Ling Rui serious

19
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,650
or was he just as drunk?

20
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,610
Dad.

21
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,770
You're not asleep, Youyou?

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,930
Aren't we going home today?

23
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,330
No.

24
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,530
Did you have a fight with Mom?

25
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,970
No.

26
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,010
Are you going to be together forever?

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,730
Yes.

28
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,530
Will you sleep together?

29
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,250
Can I sleep with you

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,450
when you sleep together?

31
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,250
Youyou,

32
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,370
who told you these?

33
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,290
My girlfriend abroad,

34
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,010
Lily told me these.

35
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,450
Her mom and dad

36
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,650
leave her alone

37
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,330
when they sleep.

38
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,650
Mom and Dad

39
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,850
will always be by your side

40
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,250
and never leave you alone.

41
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,170
Good night, Dad.

42
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,570
Good boy.

43
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,930
Here, head on your pillow.

44
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,970
Good night, Youyou.

45
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,570
Get back together? Are we really getting back together?

46
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,890
It's definitely not because of me.

47
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,330
Is it for Youyou,

48
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:41,650
or me?

49
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,410
Because of Youyou?

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,010
Or maybe the both of us?

51
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,650
Why did you say that?

52
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,490
I'm going to pick Youyou up today.

53
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,530
I'll see you later.

54
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,010
What should I do?

55
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,770
Ling Rui.

56
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,890
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute.

57
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,930
Well...

58
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,570
I thought about it.

59
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,290
I think

60
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,640
it's best I don't go up there.

61
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,010
You're not picking up Youyou?

62
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,690
Can't you get him here?

63
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,330
I can't.

64
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,090
Here is the case.

65
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,130
You know, my aunt

66
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,250
gave me too many books,

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,890
I haven't finished

68
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,850
reading yet.

69
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,090
I'm afraid I can't give a good answer

70
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,890
when she asks me about it.

71
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,690
That would be awkward.

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,730
And our mom,

73
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,450
when our mom…

74
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,410
No, your mom.

75
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,650
Your mom must be shocked

76
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,650
to see me.

77
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,090
You've changed.

78
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,610
You wouldn't

79
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,090
force me like this before.

80
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,050
As you said yesterday,

81
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,450
we've both changed.

82
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,130
Why must I go up?

83
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,400
You came to pick up Youyou,

84
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,130
yet you won't get to the door.

85
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,090
Do you want Youyou

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,400
to think that his mom won't

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,210
come to Grandma's home

88
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,410
because we're having a fight?

89
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,730
-Let's go.
-Wait.

90
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,010
I was drunk yesterday.

91
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,609
So, I'm not sure.

92
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,330
But I

93
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,090
seemed to hear you said

94
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,570
that we...

95
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,609
We're back together.

96
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,130
I see.

97
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,690
Why?

98
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,850
Is a reason needed?

99
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,050
It's good for us.

100
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,290
In what aspect?

101
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,290
In every aspect.

102
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,090
Forty-five. Forty-six. Forty-seven.

103
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,530
-Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty.
-Forty-eight. Forty-nine.

104
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,330
-Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.
-Fifty-three.

105
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,290
Fifty-four. Fifty-five.

106
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,570
Fifty-six.

107
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,890
Fifty-seven.

108
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,210
Fifty-eight. Fifty-nine. Ninety.

109
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,650
-Fangning and I...
-Ninety-two.

110
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,740
Ninety-three.

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,190
-We're back together.
-Ninety-four. Ninety-five.

112
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,890
What?

113
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,050
Mom, you're here.

114
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,370
Good boy.

115
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,690
Youyou,

116
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,490
I have an important assignment

117
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,850
for you, okay?

118
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,250
What assignment?

119
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,090
Here, come with me.

120
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,960
Hi.

121
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,250
When are you getting the certificate?

122
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,610
Will you hold another wedding?

123
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm against this.

124
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,330
They got back together,

125
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,810
why are you against it?

126
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,850
They once had

127
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,050
a failed marriage.

128
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,129
That means they

129
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,050
are not meant for each other.

130
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,570
Why should they get back together?

131
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,609
Aunt,

132
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,730
I don't think it was a failure.

133
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,170
Fangning,

134
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,690
do you think our marriage

135
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,650
was a failure?

136
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,770
No, no, no. It was not.

137
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,690
I was a failure.

138
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,250
I was not mature and sensible

139
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,610
six years ago.

140
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,240
She is right.

141
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,690
She was not mature and sensible.

142
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,410
She left without a word six years ago.

143
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,930
Did you forget

144
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,690
how much pain

145
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
she has brought you?

146
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,170
Because of our experience,

147
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,970
she'll cherish me even more now.

148
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,370
It has been six years.

149
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,650
You've both changed.

150
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,850
Who knows

151
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,530
if you suit each other now?

152
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,130
Six years ago,

153
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,170
we managed to be together.

154
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,090
Now that we're back together,

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,090
we don't have to know each other

156
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,610
all over again.

157
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,610
We don't even have to

158
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,810
explain to others.

159
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,010
This is a good thing for both of us.

160
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,930
I think

161
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,370
Lu Fangning

162
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,090
is the right person for me.

163
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,770
I can't argue with you.

164
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,010
All right.

165
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,840
It's not like

166
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,970
we've managed

167
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,170
to sway Ling Rui's decision before.

168
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,370
Mom.

169
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,450
Stop drinking water.

170
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,600
Fangning and I

171
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,770
could take you to a coffee shop.

172
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,730
Okay.

173
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,330
There will be no problem

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,010
if Fangning comes with me.

175
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,410
You...

176
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,450
Um, Fangning.

177
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,850
You can stay here

178
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,770
for dinner tonight.

179
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,290
Yes.

180
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,770
Sister.

181
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,570
Sister.

182
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,930
Get ready.

183
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,410
Don't just sit here.

184
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,530
What do you want for dinner? Start preparing.

185
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,170
Get working.

186
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,810
Let's go.

187
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,650
Let's go, Sister.

188
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,930
Let's go.

189
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,930
You should check on Youyou.

190
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,290
Okay.

191
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,250
We can go on a stroll

192
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,850
with him after dinner.

193
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,330
Okay.

194
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,730
I'll go help in the kitchen.

195
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,650
Okay.

196
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,650
Dinner.

197
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,330
How many times

198
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:16,970
have I told you?

199
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,050
The stopcock dropped off.

200
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,200
I can't install it myself.

201
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,050
The water keeps running.

202
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,810
What if my house becomes flooded?

203
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,690
I called you yesterday,

204
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,770
didn't I?

205
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,210
Why didn't you come?

206
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,410
Aren't you coming now?

207
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,610
How can you...

208
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,970
Hello?

209
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,130
I'm the one paying you, okay?

210
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,410
Who is it?

211
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,650
A surprise from the management?

212
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,850
Why are you here?

213
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,370
Who else are you expecting?

214
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,210
A plumber.

215
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,810
The trouble arrived and help

216
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,730
is nowhere to be seen.

217
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,530
What do you want?

218
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,490
You didn't answer

219
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,610
the question I asked you.

220
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,810
You got my answer.

221
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,250
What did you say?

222
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,610
What happened between us

223
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,490
six years ago?

224
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,210
Old man, are you done yet?

225
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,370
I answered it

226
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,330
six years ago.

227
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,890
I answered it a week ago.

228
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,770
Can you ask

229
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,010
something new?

230
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,370
Then why is your Weibo...

231
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,170
Wait a second.

232
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,410
At this rate,

233
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,090
there is no end to this conversation.

234
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,810
I don't have the time to waste on you.

235
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,770
I'm busy.

236
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,770
What are you doing?

237
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,920
The stopcock is off.

238
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,610
You're strong.

239
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,210
How did you pull it out?

240
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,170
You're a man, right?

241
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,210
Of course I am.

242
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,410
Go fix it.

243
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,450
I didn't say I could fix this.

244
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,650
Fixing and patching,

245
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,610
and being a plumber are

246
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,520
basics for every man.

247
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,360
Right?

248
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,050
Here.

249
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,410
I got the tools.

250
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,370
Go fix it.

251
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,850
Stop standing there.

252
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,730
Take your time.

253
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,930
[Get to work.]

254
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,490
[I must finish it today.]

255
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,370
What happened?

256
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,570
Ah.

257
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,450
[He's drenched.]

258
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,210
Why are you still standing here?

259
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,050
Stop staring,

260
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,290
go grab a towel.

261
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,170
A towel...

262
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,730
Inspiration hits me.

263
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,610
Oh, no. It hurts.

264
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,520
[Cosmic Century]

265
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,530
I finally finished it.

266
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,770
Lu Yiyao

267
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,570
is my muse.

268
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,850
Lu Yiyao.

269
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:38,650
Lu...

270
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,570
Was it a dream,

271
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,610
or did it really happen?

272
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,370
Dad,

273
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,130
will you and Mom

274
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,730
stay with me together

275
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,410
all the time?

276
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,730
Yes.

277
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,610
Youyou.

278
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,970
Have some water.

279
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,930
You need to stay hydrated. Here.

280
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,850
Good boy.

281
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,530
What else

282
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,770
do you want to buy?

283
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,410
I'm going to buy some underwear.

284
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,250
Well...

285
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,450
I'm not going with you.

286
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,010
I'll browse for the vegetables.

287
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,050
Good boy.

288
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,760
I remember someone

289
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,170
asked me to buy her

290
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,490
female sanitary products.

291
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,250
Let's go.

292
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,170
Where is the underwear?

293
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,930
Let's go.

294
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,610
-Youyou.
-Youyou.

295
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,570
-Sit still.
-Sit still.

296
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,569
What do you want? I can grab it for you.

297
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,890
I want potato chips.

298
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,720
This one.

299
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,610
Youyou.

300
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,529
It's not

301
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,250
Snack Day of this month yet.

302
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,490
Did you forget?

303
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,529
A little boy

304
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,049
suffered from a throat inflammation

305
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,090
because he ate too much potato chips,

306
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,769
do you remember that?

307
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,930
It's okay to have some sometimes.

308
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,690
Besides,

309
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,450
Mom eats it at night

310
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,410
while people aren't watching.

311
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,730
You put potato chips in the safe.

312
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,210
You can't fool me!

313
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,090
Well, I am an adult.

314
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,250
It's okay

315
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,250
for me to eat it once.

316
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,170
I won't have throat inflammation.

317
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,170
-Youyou.
-Dad.

318
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,650
Dad.

319
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,000
Dad.

320
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,530
Is Mom too broke

321
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,770
to buy me a bag of potato chips?

322
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,730
No.

323
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,130
Mom wants you to be healthy.

324
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,530
She doesn't want you

325
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,170
to have the habit of eating snacks.

326
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,650
Then I won't make it a habit,

327
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,370
okay?

328
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,450
No.

329
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,290
Dad, get me down.

330
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,610
You are quite heavy.

331
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,970
Dad.

332
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,890
Buy me one bag, all right?

333
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,850
That looks delicious.

334
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,130
Don't you want some too?

335
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,170
I'll just have several pieces,

336
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,730
you can have the rest.

337
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,330
All right?

338
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,050
Youyou,

339
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,490
I saw

340
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,090
some fresh vegetables over there.

341
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,490
I could buy some

342
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,370
and make you

343
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,450
vegetable dishes tonight?

344
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,690
I don't like vegetables.

345
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,690
Don't yell.

346
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,490
This is a public space.

347
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,730
Once you have a bag of potato chips,

348
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,370
you should take ten times of

349
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,290
vegetable dishes for enough nutrition.

350
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,010
Do you know that?

351
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,890
I don't like vegetables.

352
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,610
Then I'll have one piece of potato chip,

353
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,890
does that mean I only need

354
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,090
one green dish?

355
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,050
Youyou.

356
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,090
Stand here.

357
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,890
I'll offer you two options.

358
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,570
You can either hold my hand

359
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,050
and we buy some vegetables,

360
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,770
or you can hold Mom's hand

361
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,250
and we go check out now.

362
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,610
Which will it be?

363
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,490
Have you decided?

364
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:11,920
Who do you pick?

365
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,450
Mom.

366
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,650
Here, hold my hand.

367
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,010
You know

368
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,330
how to deal with children.

369
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,970
Let's go.

370
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,570
You're a good mom too.

371
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,570
Youyou.

372
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,570
Youyou.

373
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,930
Change your shoes first.

374
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,890
Why didn't you buy

375
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,090
potato chips for me today?

376
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,250
Why?

377
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,530
I'll get you some next time.

378
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:38,930
Okay?

379
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,730
Yes.

380
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,730
Here.

381
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,970
Youyou,

382
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,330
what do you do after you come home?

383
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,570
I must wash my hands.

384
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,530
Go do it.

385
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,520
I'll wait for Dad.

386
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,690
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Dad.

387
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,850
Let's wash our hands.

388
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,130
Let's wash our hands.

389
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,370
A good wife.

390
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,970
A good mom.

391
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,170
What else?

392
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,690
What else can I do well?

393
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
Fangning.

394
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,850
I...

395
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,050
I'm unpacking the things.

396
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,840
Yes.

397
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,970
I didn't see it clearly.

398
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,930
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,370
It's okay.

400
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,490
I'll put the things

401
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,410
in the bedroom and bathroom.

402
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,530
But you have to

403
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,930
spare some room for me.

404
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,730
Okay.

405
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,570
Spare...

406
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,770
To spare some room in my bedroom?

407
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,610
That's for sure.

408
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,330
Aren't you

409
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,930
sleeping with Youyou?

410
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,650
Lu Fangning.

411
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,890
Did you forget that

412
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,370
we're now back together?

413
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,450
Listen,

414
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,410
Youyou is asking for me.

415
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,250
Youyou?

416
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,810
What's up, Youyou?

417
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,290
Youyou.

418
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,370
Really?

419
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,090
Dad and Mom

420
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,450
are really back together.

421
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,690
Yes.

422
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,610
Thank you for taking in Mom.

423
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,170
You're such a good person.

424
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,250
You're an angel!

425
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,770
How could you say that?

426
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:49,770
You sound like

427
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,090
I was a bad person.

428
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,880
Dad,

429
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,560
is Mom going to

430
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,050
stay here forever?

431
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,530
Am I going

432
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,600
to the school here?

433
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,610
Why didn't Mom tell me earlier?

434
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,450
What if I can't catch up with the course?

435
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,290
Right.

436
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,850
Should I

437
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,490
change my name

438
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,890
to Ling Youyou?

439
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,130
It doesn't sound nice.

440
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,130
Dad,

441
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,490
can I name

442
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,770
myself?

443
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,890
What name do you want?

444
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,330
Like Ling Tian Ares.

445
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,730
You can name yourself Ling Zero.

446
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,570
Dad,

447
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,210
Mom is bullying me.

448
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,610
You too.

449
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,610
You're using your Dad

450
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,090
to pick on me.

451
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,850
Will you sleep

452
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,970
with me tonight?

453
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,210
Tonight?

454
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,290
I'm afraid I can't.

455
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,330
Because Mom and Dad

456
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,170
will sleep together tonight.

457
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,330
Mom is a grown-up,

458
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,610
does she need your company?

459
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,960
Mom, you're so weak.

460
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,930
That's not the case.

461
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,930
It's because

462
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,410
Mom and Dad are now together.

463
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,690
Just like you and I,

464
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,930
we have to cultivate our relationship now.

465
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,090
It's okay if we do it later.

466
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,090
All right.

467
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,210
That makes sense.

468
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,490
We have a lot of time anyway.

469
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,490
Mom can have you

470
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,120
for the night.

471
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,210
Good boy.

472
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,770
Dad,

473
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,010
what will we have for dinner?

474
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,370
I'll make you the most delicious

475
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,890
stir-fried vegetables.

476
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,090
I don't like vegetables.

477
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,880
No way.

478
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,970
Kids need vegetables.

479
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,490
That's good for their health.

480
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,410
Right?

481
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,330
Of course.

482
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,650
Have more vegetables.

483
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,730
All right.

484
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,010
I'll go have fun then.

485
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,050
-Off you go.
-Off you go.

486
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,890
You see?

487
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,040
Youyou is happy.

488
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,770
Thank you, Ling Rui.

489
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,170
Don't mention it.

490
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,370
Instead of thanking me,

491
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,170
you should make it up to me.

492
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,530
I'll go pack

493
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,570
your things up.

494
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,370
Remember to put them in...

495
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,890
The bedroom. I remember that.

496
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,530
Lu Fangning.

497
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,450
Be sober.

498
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,770
What are you thinking?

499
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,170
We can sleep separately.

500
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,290
Separately.

501
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,730
Be cool.

502
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,250
Inner peace.

503
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,450
All wishes come true.

504
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,610
What am I saying?

505
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,570
Aren't you asleep?

506
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,130
You woke me up.

507
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,130
What?

508
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,690
I'm not prepared.

509
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,410
You don't have to prepare for it.

510
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,210
I told you that

511
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,290
in the past.

512
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,810
That's all?

513
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,770
I'm a little tired today,

514
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,850
I'll sleep first.

515
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,450
Good night.

516
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,810
I may not be tired

517
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,050
if you keep staring at me.

518
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,370
Okay, never mind.

519
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,010
I didn't sleep well the whole night.

520
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,480
Youyou, get up.

521
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,450
Don't let me

522
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,250
wait for you in front of the bathroom.

523
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,490
Morning.

524
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,210
Morning.

525
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,450
Breakfast is ready.

526
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,080
We can have it after Youyou gets up.

527
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,610
[There should be mine this time.]

528
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,800
Come here.

529
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,930
Do you want your breakfast?

530
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,170
Judging by your personality,

531
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,370
wouldn't you pay me for breakfast?

532
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,170
I'm brushing my teeth.

533
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,370
Is there toothpaste on my lips?

534
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,050
Clean it up for me.

535
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,290
A little bit left.

536
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,210
Thank you.

537
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,130
Go.

538
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,760
You can have breakfast

539
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,010
after you're done.

540
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,290
Here, Youyou.

541
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,170
Have an egg.

542
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,930
Mom,

543
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,290
didn't you cultivate your relationship

544
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,810
with Dad last night?

545
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,890
What?

546
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,250
Cultivating your relationship.

547
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,040
Did you

548
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,330
decide on my name?

549
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,690
Youyou.

550
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,970
Finish your breakfast.

551
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,890
You

552
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,570
are still Lu Youyou for now.

553
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,810
Fangning,

554
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,490
any plan for today?

555
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm going to

556
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,450
the art park today

557
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,890
to see the shop

558
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,170
Mr. Cao recommended,

559
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,410
then I'll go to check out

560
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,490
the details of the contract.

561
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,930
Is it settled?

562
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,440
Settled.

563
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,530
I'll go to check out some schools

564
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,450
for Youyou if I'm available.

565
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,650
Mom,

566
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,800
can I pick it myself?

567
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,770
Of course.

568
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,970
But you first need to make it past the entrance test.

569
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,330
There is a standard.

570
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,250
Is that clear?

571
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,530
I'm full.

572
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,890
Mom,

573
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,930
I'm full.

574
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,930
Take your time.

575
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,690
You're full?

576
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,130
Where are you going, baby?

577
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,410
I must do some reading.

578
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,490
You barely ate anything.

579
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,610
The kid

580
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,730
really takes after you.

581
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,090
Let me drive you there.

582
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,730
What?

583
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,210
To the art park.

584
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,970
Never mind.

585
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,690
You can cultivate your relationship

586
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,850
with Youyou at home.

587
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,890
What about you?

588
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,690
I don't need to.

589
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,850
No.

590
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,490
I mean,

591
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,690
I can manage it myself.

592
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,850
I'm an adult.

593
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,930
I won't get lost.

594
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,050
Shen Zhuo will accompany me.

595
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,840
Don't worry.

596
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,850
I'll drive you there.

597
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,400
I haven't had it yet.

598
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,810
You're full.

599
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,250
Let's go.

600
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:28,770
Ms. Lu.

601
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,090
There are two floors.

602
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,570
The e-commerce platforms are taking off.

603
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,290
A large number

604
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,450
of the shops in the art park

605
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,250
are used as an experience center

606
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,050
to exhibit major design works.

607
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,170
The space

608
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,650
should be enough.

609
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,770
The space is good.

610
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,890
The place isn't fully renovated yet.

611
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,930
That's fine.

612
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,130
This makes it easy for me

613
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,370
to decorate it as I please.

614
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,410
How is it, Ms. Lu?

615
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,610
Are you satisfied with this?

616
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,770
Ms. Lu.

617
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,130
You have nothing to worry about.

618
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,130
The location and construction of the shop

619
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,650
are top of the line.

620
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,930
I'll never go back on my promise

621
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,770
with Dr. Ling.

622
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,290
Thank you, Cao.

623
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,330
Of course I'm not worried.

624
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,730
I just

625
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,330
came by because

626
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,690
I have some free time.

627
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,410
Feel free to look around.

628
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,130
Shen Zhuo.

629
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,210
Never mind.

630
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,370
I'll take this shop.

631
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,370
This place will be

632
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,530
the official starting point

633
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,730
of the White Queen in this country.

634
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,450
How is the contract?

635
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,810
It's good.

636
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,160
I don't see any problems.

637
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,250
The terms

638
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,370
are sensible.

639
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,520
I think we can sign it.

640
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,650
Will you take a look?

641
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,850
Never mind.

642
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,130
You're the boss.

643
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,570
You've sold me out

644
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,930
so many times already.

645
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,530
Ms. Lu,

646
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,690
if there is

647
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,490
no problem with the contract,

648
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,690
I'll start preparing.

649
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,730
We can sign the contract very soon.

650
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,530
Okay.

651
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,410
Ling Rui.

652
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,130
Will you take a look too?

653
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,129
Dr. Ling can read a contract?

654
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,490
He is better at this than me.

655
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,330
Stop playing.

656
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,330
It's okay.

657
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,850
What's the matter?

658
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,530
Is there something wrong?

659
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,480
The years of cooperation

660
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,730
could be extended.

661
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,129
Ms. Lu said

662
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:39,570
she'd make it for five years

663
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,450
when I talked it over with her and Mr. Shen.

664
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,010
If Ms. Lu would like to

665
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,890
extend our cooperation,

666
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,250
I'll be glad to accept it.

667
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:59,490
Okay, okay.

668
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,450
I'm fine with that.

669
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,810
Okay. No problem at all.

670
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,570
Eight or ten years are all fine.

671
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,930
You're selling yourself to him.

672
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,610
You'll get a 30% cut.

673
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,250
Good.

674
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,010
Go away.

675
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,930
Isn't the penalty

676
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,010
too low?

677
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,410
Low?

678
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,210
Higher penalty

679
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,010
ensures the spirit of contract

680
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,770
for each side.

681
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,610
I'm afraid that someone

682
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,490
might run away

683
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,290
without one word.

684
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,570
What do you think, Fangning?

685
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,010
How unbelievable.

686
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,290
Well...

687
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,970
How about we make it triple?

688
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,770
All right, it's fine with me.

689
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,370
It's fine.

690
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,570
I think it makes sense.

691
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,010
No way.

692
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,970
This is an unequal treaty.

693
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,970
Now that Fangning agrees,

694
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,770
we can sign the contract.

695
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,970
Dr. Ling, Ms. Lu.

696
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,250
Once we've signed the contract,

697
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,570
it'll become legally effective right away.

698
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,570
I can't compensate for the money

699
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,970
even if you sell me.

700
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,690
It's okay.

701
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,290
If she skipped town,

702
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,610
this would be

703
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,410
a joint debt for both of us.

704
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,490
I could compensate for it in her place.

705
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,890
Compensation?

706
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,970
Couple?

707
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,770
Lu Fangning.

708
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,370
You two...

709
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,770
I see.

710
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,130
Congratulations.

711
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,650
No wonder.

712
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,130
I've never seen

713
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,410
Dr. Ling

714
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,010
so concerned about

715
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,330
anything other than work.

716
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,810
This is great.

717
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,570
The girls in the company

718
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,650
can stop asking me

719
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,170
to fix them up with you.

720
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,570
Then I'll

721
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,210
go revise

722
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,490
the contract

723
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,570
and send it to you.

724
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,530
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

725
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,090
Okay.

726
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,090
May this be a great partnership.

727
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,970
Likewise.

728
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,410
I should get going.

729
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,500
Goodbye.

730
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,230
-Bye.
-Bye.

731
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,800
Goodbye.

732
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,130
I'll go to the exhibition.

733
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,810
Goodbye.

734
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,170
Don't worry.

735
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,530
Is he okay?

736
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,650
Let me see the contract

737
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,290
after it's revised.

738
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,890
I'll be in the debt with you.

739
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,890
I should know about it.

740
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,410
I'll go back to the hospital later.

741
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,320
There is an important meeting next week.

742
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,490
I have to go back

743
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,530
to sort my data.

744
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,770
Let me drive you.

745
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,810
Never mind.

746
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,810
You're going

747
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,370
to be busy for a while.

748
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,610
Then I'll come to pick you up for dinner.

749
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,570
I'll wait for you.

750
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,410
I mean,

751
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,280
I'll wait for you so that

752
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,290
we can go

753
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,290
pick up Youyou together.

754
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,450
He will be so happy.

755
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:04,930
Okay.

756
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,730
Then I'll come to pick up you for dinner,

757
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,490
then we'll pick up Youyou.

758
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,410
Fangning.

759
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,760
I didn't see anyone of them.

760
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,370
Those girls

761
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,600
Mr. Cao and the others

762
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,450
introduced to me,

763
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,490
I didn't see anyone of them.

764
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,010
You saw me

765
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,690
on a blind date with Dr. Yu the other day

766
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,210
because I didn't want my aunt

767
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,200
to be worried.

768
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,770
It's okay.

769
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,890
You don't have to explain it to me.

770
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,370
I don't mind.

771
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,810
I want you to know.

772
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,840
Ling Rui.

773
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,650
I'd like to ask you one more time.

774
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,210
Are we...

775
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,970
Fangning,

776
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,130
I have worked at the hospital.

777
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,930
Isn't Shen Zhuo waiting for you

778
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,210
to revise the contract?

779
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,130
I should get going.

780
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,650
I'll pick you up at night.

781
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,810
See you.

782
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,050
Mr. Gao.

783
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,010
Thanks for your support

784
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,570
of our work over the years.

785
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,650
We will do

786
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,050
as you requested.

787
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,050
You have my word.

788
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,970
I'll expect good news from you.

789
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,610
Okay.

790
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,690
If there is nothing else,

791
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,770
I must get back to my work.

792
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,970
Dr. Ling.

793
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,290
Mr. Gao.

794
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,730
Why are you here?

795
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,690
I just came by

796
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,810
to have a look.

797
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,370
I didn't expect to see you here.

798
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,800
I heard that

799
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,130
Lu Fangning has come back.

800
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,170
Well?

801
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,650
How is she lately?

802
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,930
Fangning just

803
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,210
settled down here.

804
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,330
Then you showed up here.

805
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,250
Is this only a coincidence?

806
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,690
You got Lu Sing

807
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,010
six years ago.

808
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,410
I hope you won't

809
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,730
ruin her life again.

810
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,890
Without Lu Sing,

811
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,130
Lu Fangning

812
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,650
can create

813
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,730
a new brand.

814
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:23,850
So,

815
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,130
why would I

816
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,770
listen to you?

817
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,690
Dr. Ling?

818
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,730
You've tried it once,

819
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,330
and you didn't get what you want.

820
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,250
There is nothing you can do

821
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,130
to make amend.

822
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,050
It sounds like you

823
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,240
know me very well.

824
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,010
I understand the feeling

825
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,170
of being trapped in memory.

826
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,970
Then you're more fortunate than I am.

827
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,530
Shen Zhuo.

828
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,160
Shen Zhuo.

829
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,130
What are you doing?

830
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,650
I'm talking to you.

831
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,650
Hey.

832
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,450
What are you doing?

833
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,370
Don't give me the attitude.

834
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,050
I'm talking to you.

835
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,450
I just searched on the Internet

836
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,370
to see

837
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,320
if there is a case

838
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,250
of someone

839
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,090
who suddenly

840
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,890
got a split personality.

841
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,040
Shut up.

842
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,450
Are you asking for trouble?

843
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,370
Don't be absurd.

844
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,290
This is

845
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,170
the Lu Fangning I know.

846
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,530
Scold me more.

847
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,570
See if you'll

848
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,210
be soberer.

849
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,690
Think it through.

850
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,930
How could you just

851
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,010
sign the unequal treaty.

852
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,130
You didn't even spare your time

853
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,930
to check the punctuations

854
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,370
in the contract.

855
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,570
What is this nonsense you're giving me?

856
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,650
Didn't you say

857
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,570
it'd be fine if I sold you off?

858
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,050
I haven't got to that, yet.

859
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,250
You're picking on me.

860
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,370
Weren't you cowering

861
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:11,810
at the back?

862
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,490
"Eight, nine or ten years are all fine."

863
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,130
I...

864
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,850
Well...

865
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,370
I...

866
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,090
What?

867
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,970
You said, "It's fine by me."

868
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,730
Shut up.

869
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,730
I was

870
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,130
sensible

871
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,250
and considerate.

872
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,170
You know?

873
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,530
Sensible,

874
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,130
and considerate?

875
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,240
That's ridiculous.

876
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,050
Shen Zhuo.

877
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,810
I once,

878
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,770
ran away from him.

879
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,690
And now,

880
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,090
in Ling Rui eyes,

881
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,370
I'm not

882
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,090
worthy of his trust.

883
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,890
So,

884
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,210
if I can make him feel secure

885
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,010
by doing this,

886
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,610
then it's fine by me.

887
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,730
Not again.

888
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,330
It's the same all over again.

889
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,570
What spell

890
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,650
did he cast on you?

891
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,530
Did he make you drink

892
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,250
some kind

893
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,170
of love potion

894
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,010
to bewitch you?

895
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,530
Love? No.

896
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,010
Then what?

897
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,770
He didn't say if he loved me.

898
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,730
I see.

899
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,690
You must have driven him insane

900
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,850
six years ago.

901
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,970
So he drew a dungeon

902
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:25,690
to confine you

903
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,450
so you can't escape,

904
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,090
He tortured you.

905
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:27,970
Shut up.

906
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,530
I should tell Ling Rui

907
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,170
everything

908
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,250
you just said.

909
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,930
He could teach a lesson.

910
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,210
You even rely on him

911
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,090
to punish

912
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,890
me?

913
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,850
You're so annoying.

914
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,850
Stop it.

915
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,090
What are you saying?

916
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,900
-Hit your darling Ling Rui.
-Beat you up.

917
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,530
I'll beat you up!

918
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,690
What for?

919
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,250
Yeah, so what?

920
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:53,890
[LM Deer Sing Group]

921
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,610
[Yueyue,]

922
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,690
[I've arranged the luggage for you.]

923
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,170
[Let's go to the airport directly.]

924
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,690
We promised

925
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,770
we'd leave right away.

926
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,410
I have to celebrate

927
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,930
my sister's 18th birthday.

928
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,530
But I'm afraid you can't come out

929
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,530
once you've gone back.

930
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,210
Your dad...

931
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,050
I must go back.

932
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,130
This is my sister's birthday wish.

933
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,410
Moreover,

934
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,370
this could be the last time.

935
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,970
So just let me be there

936
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,210
for her birthday.

937
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,970
It's just a birthday party.

938
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,370
Erfan.

939
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:27,650
You know that.

940
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:28,930
Family,

941
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,130
kids,

942
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,610
and Infinity

943
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,920
are my life goals.

944
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,370
And,

945
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,690
Fangning matters the most to me.

946
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,690
What about me?

947
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,450
I promise you,

948
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,930
I'll be back soon.

949
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:43,970
All right?

950
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,490
Yueyue, actually I...

951
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,290
I'll be back soon.

952
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,410
Wait for me.

953
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,040
-[Take care then.]
-[Okay.]

954
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,210
[I'm waiting for you.]

955
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,050
[Okay.]

956
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,850
Yueyue.

957
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:26,850
Lu Yue.

958
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,210
Your sister is back.
