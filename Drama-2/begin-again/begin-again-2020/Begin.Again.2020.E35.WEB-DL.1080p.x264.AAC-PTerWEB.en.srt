[Episode 35]

4
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,110
Youyou.

5
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,429
What should you call me?

6
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:46,940
Little Grandpa!

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,190
What should you call her?

8
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,709
Auntie Cai.

9
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,950
You can't call us like that.

10
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,950
Why?

11
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,470
She is my girlfriend.

12
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,150
If you called her that,

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,550
the relationship would be messed up.

14
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,830
Then should I call Auntie Cai

15
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,940
Little Grandma?

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,230
No.

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,300
I don't want to be

18
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,390
your grandpa's girlfriend.

19
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,630
Youyou,

20
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,070
you should call me Uncle Simon from now on.

21
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,140
If I were

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,670
your Little Grandpa,

23
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,150
I might not get married.

24
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,670
Then you would

25
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,830
only get one red pocket.

26
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,190
If you call me

27
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,390
Uncle Simon,

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,550
you can get two red pockets

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,750
from me and Auntie Cai

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,870
during Lunar New Year.

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,270
Isn't that a better deal?

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,070
You're happy.

33
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,100
You're smart.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,940
Why are you

35
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,710
so serious with a kid?

36
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,270
You're so much older than him.

37
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,029
Right?

38
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,820
Besides,

39
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,750
who said I'm going to marry you?

40
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,910
You...

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,630
Who is old?

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,310
Then why are you so eager to get married?

43
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,750
Look at

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,900
Fangning and Ling Rui.

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,670
They have a happy life.

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,700
We're different.

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,670
How could you tell without trying?

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,140
Is this a matter of trying?

49
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,390
Well,

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,550
if it doesn't work out, we can always get a divorce.

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,750
Lu Yiyao, what's wrong with you?

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,140
Why are you thinking about divorce before we get married?

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,630
No, wait.

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,030
I'm not going to marry you.

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,350
Give me a kiss.

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,420
Call me Uncle Simon.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,029
Uncle Simon.

58
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,190
Right.

59
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,070
Good.

60
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,300
What do you want? I can get you some.

61
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,550
Never mind.

62
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,260
Aren't you going to have anything?

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,710
No, I'm on a diet.

64
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,190
I don't want to look fat on the camera.

65
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,870
Well,

66
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,390
I saw photos

67
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,150
of your new drama.

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,980
I think you're in great shape.

69
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,990
You're not fat, really.

70
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,270
You saw them?

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,990
Really? I look pretty, right?

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,750
The director said I did well

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,700
for that love scene.

74
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,990
He's going to give me

75
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,350
a heartbreak scene next.

76
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,030
I believe I can do well.

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,750
What's wrong?

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,870
It's embarrassing.

79
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,110
I didn't mean that.

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,630
I'm not blaming you.

81
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,910
I understand.

82
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,630
One doesn't have to

83
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,100
own what one likes.

84
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,070
Enough about that.

85
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,109
Today is Lu Fangning's birthday.

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,300
Let's not

87
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,430
talk about the unpleasant stuff.

88
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,150
Here.

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,900
Have some.

90
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,670
This is your favorite.

91
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,350
Don't go on a diet.

92
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,470
I'll gain weight.

93
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,110
No, you won't.

94
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,390
I think

95
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,990
you're already very beautiful.

96
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,180
You know what?

97
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,700
I don't want to lose weight,

98
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,990
and I don't want to be a superstar.

99
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,310
I just want someone

100
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,590
who truly cares about me

101
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,070
and likes me.

102
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,750
That's what I want.

103
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,030
I know.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,540
You know?

105
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,830
Yes.

106
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,430
I know.

107
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,630
Do you really get it?

108
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,350
I knew it!

109
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,430
Do you get it now?

110
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,109
You're here.

111
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,270
I…

112
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,990
I…

113
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
I missed you so much.

114
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,470
I missed you so much.

115
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,190
I really missed you.

116
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,950
Erfan,

117
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,710
all my wishes

118
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,590
have come true.

119
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,980
I have my family.

120
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,190
Uncle, what are you doing?

121
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,110
And the kid.

122
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,910
I understand now.

123
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,090
[Deer Sing Group]

124
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,350
[This is perhaps]

125
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,350
[the most memorable birthday I've ever had.]

126
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,390
[But it definitely won't be the last one.]

127
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,950
[Maybe we don't have]

128
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,910
[that much time in our lives,]

129
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,060
[and we can only celebrate our birthdays so many times.]

130
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,580
[But as long as we can be together]

131
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,510
[with the people we love,]

132
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,630
[perhaps...]

133
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,150
[the future holds endless possibilities for us.]

134
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,790
Sister.

135
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,340
Fangning.

136
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,910
Happy Birthday.

137
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,110
Sister.

138
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,910
You saw it, too.

139
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,990
Would you be proud of me?

140
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,830
I'm very proud of you.

141
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,870
I've always been proud of you.

142
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,990
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you

143
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,790
that life could be

144
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,110
shackled by many things.

145
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,870
Don't make it so complicated.

146
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,790
Do whatever you want.

147
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,270
Be the person you want to be.

148
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,510
Remember,

149
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,030
no matter what you do,

150
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,070
I'll always be there for you

151
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,260
to give you my support

152
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,270
and keep you company.

153
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,340
Thank you, Sister.

154
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,230
I miss you so much.

155
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,220
Well,

156
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,910
I'm going to start my own life now.

157
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,830
Fangning.

158
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,550
What happened?

159
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,590
Why are you crying?

160
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,950
What happened?

161
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,990
Nothing,

162
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,590
I'm overjoyed.

163
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,910
Really.

164
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,710
Thank you

165
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,670
for the birthday party.

166
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,150
Actually,

167
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,830
Infinity,

168
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,030
our family,

169
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,710
and our kid

170
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,670
are the wishes

171
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,070
my sister wanted to realize

172
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,670
before 30 years old.

173
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,550
That was why I wanted to have a child

174
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,910
with you so badly back then.

175
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,190
Your wishes came true.

176
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,900
I've always wondered

177
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,510
how I was able

178
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,510
to be a man of perfection.

179
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,870
Maybe

180
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,510
you're the gift

181
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,150
from my sister.

182
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,710
Fangning,

183
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,990
no matter what you want to do,

184
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,430
I'll always be there for you

185
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,660
until you realize your dreams.

186
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,910
So where's my gift?

187
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,110
Isn't the party

188
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,470
the gift

189
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,710
you wanted?

190
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,310
That's all?

191
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,030
What else do you want?

192
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,870
Well,

193
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,350
let me show you

194
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,670
how magnanimous I am.

195
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,230
Listen,

196
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,710
I would be very happy

197
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,140
no matter what you give me.

198
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,470
Thank you.

199
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,990
Thank you, too.

200
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,110
Daughter-in-law,

201
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,510
I'm so happy today.

202
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,670
You must be tired

203
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,270
from being here all night.

204
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,580
Go home and rest well.

205
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,550
-Okay.
-Don't stay up too late.

206
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's go home.

207
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,430
Rest well.

208
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,710
In-laws, I'm going home.

209
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,150
Drive safely.

210
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,910
See you.

211
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,750
See you.

212
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,430
Tell Ling Rui when you arrive.

213
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,270
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Auntie.

214
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,070
-Goodbye, Auntie.
-Goodbye.

215
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,990
Well, Fangning,

216
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,990
we should leave too.

217
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,510
I'll send her home.

218
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,180
Don't worry.

219
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,790
Don't show off here.

220
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,710
I'm going now.

221
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,230
Listen to me.

222
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,990
Don't get too tired.

223
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,230
That's enough.

224
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,350
Bye.

225
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,070
Off you go.

226
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,310
Don't miss me.

227
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,670
Peng Bo.

228
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,510
See you.

229
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,460
-Goodbye.
-Peng Bo.

230
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,870
Good luck.

231
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,750
Good boy.

232
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,270
Dad, I didn't really

233
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,710
have the time for you today.

234
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,350
I'm very happy.

235
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,390
You're not a kid, save it.

236
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,390
You have

237
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,740
your son now.

238
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,150
Youyou.

239
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,230
Do you want to sleep with your daddy and mommy

240
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,660
or your grandma and grandpa?

241
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,300
With grandma!

242
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,140
With grandma and grandpa?

243
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,950
With grandma!

244
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,550
I have chocolate for you.

245
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,550
Grandma and grandpa!

246
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,230
Then you can sleep with grandma.

247
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,910
You naughty boy.

248
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,710
You just don't want to stay

249
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,630
and clean up with us, right?

250
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,780
-That's exactly it.
-That's right!

251
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,830
Okay, just go.

252
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,990
Rest well.

253
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,950
Don't worry, Sister.

254
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,510
-Dad, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

255
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,390
Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.

256
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,780
Don't let him play too many games.

257
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,630
-Okay.
-We'll take care of him.

258
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,590
Bye.

259
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,830
Say goodbye to your mommy.

260
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,390
Goodbye.

261
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,750
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

262
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,360
Goodbye.

263
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,970
Let me carry you.

264
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,310
Slow down.

265
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,230
-Let's go!
-All right.

266
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,070
Okay, it's time to go home.

267
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,950
We should...

268
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,230
No, you got it all wrong.

269
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,220
We are going to our own homes.

270
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,540
Okay, whatever you say.

271
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,710
Suit yourself.

272
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,310
-See you.
-See you.

273
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,300
I would give you a bigger surprise

274
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,340
for your birthday.

275
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,110
Who cares?

276
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
Where's Ling Rui?

277
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,870
Don't be so full of yourself.

278
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,940
[The wind chimes broke]

279
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,630
[when you left six years ago.

280
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,029
[Now,]

281
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,230
[I'm giving you a new one.]

282
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,140
The kid behind him.

283
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,950
Yes! Higher!

284
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,350
Here.

285
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,510
Keep the change.

286
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,510
Keep the change.

287
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,230
Grandma.

288
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,030
Thank you.

289
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,020
Young man.

290
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,910
Look.

291
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,910
It's the photo from when you were little.

292
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,230
[Fangning,]

293
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,950
[it's the first photo we had together.]

294
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,030
[You lost it,]

295
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,620
[now I got it back.]

296
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,710
[It's the beginning of our destiny.]

297
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,110
[You used to think]

298
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,510
[that everyone else]

299
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,060
[knew me better than you,]

300
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,830
[therefore,]

301
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,500
[I've recorded every day of the six years]

302
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,670
[in this diary.]

303
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,950
[I hope I could give it to you]

304
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,870
[when we meet again]

305
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,590
[so that you won't be upset anymore.]

306
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,270
[From now on,]

307
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,300
[you'll always be the one]

308
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,550
[who knows me the best.]

309
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,190
[MARRY ME]

310
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,750
Is it

311
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,950
a little too mushy?

312
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,430
I was worried

313
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,910
you might not like it.

314
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,590
But I decided

315
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,780
to take a leap of faith.

316
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,790
Fangning,

317
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,070
I'm going to proceed with

318
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,910
the last step now.

319
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,870
Do you remember the coin?

320
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,590
I've had it

321
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,190
melted into the ring.

322
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,150
It was

323
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,310
your deposit before.

324
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,230
Now

325
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,030
it's my turn.

326
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,750
Fangning,

327
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,670
are you willing to

328
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,070
marry me?

329
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,550
Although

330
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,590
you've melted your ring,

331
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,860
but I've always

332
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,270
carried mine with me.

333
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,310
You still have it

334
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,230
after so many years.

335
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,270
It has never left my side.

336
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,910
It's all right.

337
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,830
This ring

338
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,870
was a gift from my husband Ling Rui.

339
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,540
This one

340
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,950
is from my boyfriend Ling Rui.

341
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,590
I want them both.

342
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,550
Great.

343
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,630
You have both now.

344
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,510
You could never run away.

345
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,910
I never want to run away.

346
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,270
You're not going anywhere either.

347
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,590
Fangning,

348
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,870
over the past six years

349
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,070
we've missed out on too many things.

350
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,510
Consider these gifts

351
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,910
as my effort to make amend.

352
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,110
I want your birthday

353
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,470
to no longer be

354
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,910
a day of sadness,

355
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,070
but a day

356
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,390
to remember.

357
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,150
So all of this

358
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,110
is the real birthday present

359
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,830
you prepared for me, right?

360
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,030
Are you satisfied?

361
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,190
Very much so.

362
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,550
Thank you.

363
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,910
Actually,

364
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,430
the present I want the most is…

365
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,030
Okay.

366
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,630
Now I've received the deposit,

367
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,230
and you're mine.

368
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,590
Let's open the gifts inside.

369
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,360
[For the millions of fans, we packed a little surprise for you...]

370
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,780
Is it okay?

371
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,790
It's too much.

372
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,910
Go a little left.

373
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,590
Left. A little left.

374
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,910
Left. A little left.

375
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,710
Is it okay?

376
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,470
A little left. Just a little.

377
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,870
A little more left.

378
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,270
I'm still injured.

379
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,590
I'll give you paid leaves.

380
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,350
Come on.

381
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,710
A little left.

382
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,150
I'm a designer.

383
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,430
How could you order me around

384
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,150
for the hard labor?

385
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,270
Is it upright?

386
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,830
It looks…

387
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,620
Is it okay?

388
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,350
How obnoxious.

389
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,470
[Sister, can you see this?]

390
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,590
[This is my new store.]

391
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,630
[It's my brand and my dream.]

392
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:57,740
Excuse me,

393
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,550
are you Ms. Lu Fangning?

394
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,500
Hello.

395
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,270
Hello,

396
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,910
a man asked me to

397
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,220
give you this.

398
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,390
Thank you.

399
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,310
[Contract of Share Transfer]

400
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,290
[Transferer: Gao Erfan] [Recipient: Lu Yiyao]

401
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,980
Is it okay?

402
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,110
Fangning.

403
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,590
Lu Fangning.

404
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,500
Ms. Lu?

405
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,860
What are you reading?

406
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,230
Any good stuff?

407
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,550
Company's Equity Assignment Agreement?

408
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,860
Youyou is now loaded!

409
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,270
Fangning,

410
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,270
is the painting okay?

411
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,580
Gao Erfan.

412
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,230
Gao Erfan.

413
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,030
What do you mean?

414
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,550
I knew you would come.

415
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,620
What's wrong?

416
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,550
You look anxious.

417
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,270
Is it because I didn't give you the share?

418
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,070
Are you upset?

419
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,790
I'm serious.

420
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,180
I'm just as serious.

421
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,950
You've read the specific terms.

422
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,630
I'll leave the Deer Sing Group.

423
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,470
All my shares

424
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,030
will be handed to

425
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,230
Lu Yiyao for safekeeping.

426
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,110
If you need them,

427
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
he will give them to you.

428
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,070
If you don't want them,

429
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,630
it will be Youyou's in the future.

430
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,590
As for

431
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,910
whether you want to restart Infinity,

432
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,550
it's up to you.

433
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,150
Why?

434
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,300
You've found

435
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,950
what you really want to do.

436
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,590
The shares of Deer Sing Group

437
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,700
don't mean that much

438
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,950
to you now.

439
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,590
While Lu Yiyao has been working for

440
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,270
Deer Sing Group for years.

441
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,190
He didn't just do it for you,

442
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,310
he really wants to

443
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,670
protect Deer Sing Group.

444
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,510
Therefore,

445
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,270
it's only proper to let him have it.

446
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,430
I mean,

447
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,310
this is all too sudden.

448
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,550
Why are you doing this?

449
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,070
You already took it out on me.

450
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,470
I must reflect on my mistakes.

451
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,710
I plan to leave this place.

452
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,390
Fangyu sent me tickets.

453
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,390
He was such a show-off.

454
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,630
I couldn't waste them.

455
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,350
So...

456
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,870
what is your plan

457
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,390
after leaving?

458
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,870
What I'm going to do

459
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,270
is none of your business.

460
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,310
Come on.

461
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,150
If it's none of my business,

462
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,990
why did you come to

463
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,110
celebrate my birthday for me?

464
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,670
Since you've done that,

465
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,300
I'll consider that

466
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,030
that I'm a friend to you.

467
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,750
Besides, it's been years.

468
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,270
Why can't I just care about you?

469
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,150
I'm going to continue traveling around the world.

470
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,310
Don't worry.

471
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,510
I won't send you

472
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,390
postcards this time.

473
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,830
But if you need…

474
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,670
No, thank you.

475
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,670
It's been so long.

476
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,630
I haven't really lived for myself.

477
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,510
I want to see the world again.

478
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,510
Who knows?

479
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,950
Maybe I'll find out

480
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,110
what my purpose is.

481
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,950
Maybe

482
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,060
that's what Lu Yue wants.

483
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,990
It might happen soon.

484
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,350
Good luck.

485
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,230
Thank you.

486
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,750
Bye.

487
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,190
Bye.

488
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,150
Gao Erfan.

489
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,350
The hair gel you used today

490
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,270
smells fine.

491
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,070
I like it.

492
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,220
Bye.

493
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,750
Siyu,

494
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,430
let's get married.

495
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,140
No.

496
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,870
I'm still young.

497
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,190
Maybe I'll meet

498
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,630
someone better in the future.

499
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,190
[No.]

500
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,710
You feel insecure

501
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,030
because you're old.

502
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,870
Or perhaps you might not

503
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,390
meet another girl prettier than me.

504
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,870
Is that why you're getting impatient?

505
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,790
[No!]

506
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,180
Old man.

507
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,380
[Ling Rui and I]

508
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,950
[are going to have another wedding.]

509
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,550
[It's the real wedding.]

510
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,750
[I'm giving you a chance to be my best man.]

511
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,510
While I was single the whole time,

512
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,700
my friends are already getting married for the second time.

513
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,030
Cai Siyu,

514
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,590
your story should be

515
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,990
at the climax by now.

516
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,310
I'm coming.

517
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,020
Lu Yiyao?

518
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,310
Siyu.

519
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,310
I don't feel well.

520
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,870
Siyu.

521
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,870
I miss you so much.

522
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,790
Siyu.

523
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,030
Siyu.

524
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,630
I've turned thirty...

525
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,590
Thirty...

526
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,470
five,

527
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,710
six,

528
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,230
seven.

529
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,870
I'm almost forty!

530
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,350
Why am I so old?

531
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,750
The kid called me grandpa!

532
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,470
Why am I still alone?

533
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,230
Lu Yiyao.

534
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,110
Have you reached

535
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,150
male menopause?

536
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,430
Who said that? I'm only…

537
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,870
I've looked up the symptoms of male menopause.

538
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,110
Lack of concentration.

539
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,230
Loss of memory.

540
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,030
Hair loss.

541
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,500
I'm suffering from all of them.

542
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,980
It's okay.

543
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,950
Calm down.

544
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,380
One more thing...

545
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,950
My waist is getting weaker!

546
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,550
Lu Yiyao, what are you doing

547
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,190
at my home

548
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,390
drunk and crying?

549
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,660
I...

550
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,550
Sleep.

551
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,350
You...

552
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,110
Sleep.

553
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,150
I'm a little tired.

554
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,110
I am drunk.

555
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,190
Just like what you wrote in the novel.

556
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,510
Become a couple

557
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,270
when the boss is drunk.

558
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,950
That would solve my problems.

559
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,140
Solve what?

560
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,150
What are you afraid of?

561
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,350
You wrote those details

562
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,110
in your novels.

563
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,830
They aren't that detailed.

564
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,390
Siyu.

565
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,430
I,

566
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,750
I've prepared everything.

567
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
Let me show you.

568
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,390
See?

569
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,420
I just want to marry you.

570
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,750
I'm not demanding anything.

571
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,070
I'm just afraid

572
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,030
that

573
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,270
if you're

574
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,710
only my girlfriend,

575
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,470
and you don't give me any promise,

576
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,070
you might leave me

577
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,430
once a nicer,

578
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,270
better-looking guy shows up.

579
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,950
Don't think

580
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,669
so little of me!

581
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,550
I'm just worried.

582
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,189
Listen to me.

583
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,149
I'm already so old,

584
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,419
and my waist is getting worse.

585
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,510
Who would want a sorry old man like myself?

586
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,870
That's enough. Sober up.

587
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,230
I used to be a jerk.

588
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,510
It was wrong for me

589
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,390
to treat you that way.

590
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:50,629
It was my fault.

591
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,230
But I love you!

592
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,510
Do you know?

593
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,710
I love you, Siyu!

594
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:58,830
I'm begging you to forgive me.

595
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,149
Please, Siyu.

596
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,350
Forgive me.

597
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,230
Do you still love me?

598
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,910
I'm begging you.

599
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,110
I'm begging you.

600
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,620
That's enough.

601
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,990
You're not old.

602
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,550
You're so handsome.

603
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,830
You will still be

604
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,990
a handsome old man later on.

605
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,350
Actually,

606
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,190
I've always thought it was such a shame.

607
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,580
You have a nice figure,

608
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,350
but I didn't see anything that day

609
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,910
and nothing happened.

610
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,670
Wouldn't that be a shame?

611
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,030
Dr. Ling,

612
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,590
your project on pancreatic cancer

613
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,790
has won the recognition

614
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,430
of many international medical institutions.

615
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,990
You've achieved greatness at a young age.

616
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,980
This is the last question.

617
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,110
It's been the main discussion

618
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,060
of many female readers.

619
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,030
You're married

620
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,310
at such a young age.

621
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,420
It's said that your wife was

622
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,590
just as outstanding.

623
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,390
Dr. Ling,

624
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,070
could you tell us

625
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,190
about your wife?

626
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,510
Her name is Lu Fangning.

627
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,670
She's

628
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,110
funny,

629
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,750
bossy…

630
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,670
She's just an ordinary person.

631
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,230
But she

632
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,340
is hardworking...

633
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,230
and remarkable.

634
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,510
A person

635
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,590
will meet a lot of

636
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,700
unexpected problems in life.

637
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,020
But she's the one

638
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,870
whom I want to

639
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,150
spend my life with.

640
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:55,580
[Fashion Doctor: Feature Interview with Ling Rui]

641
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,470
I don't think this photographer

642
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,510
is as skillful as me.

643
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,750
Your daddy looks ugly.

644
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,430
See? His left face is so puffy.

645
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,150
I don't think so.

646
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,110
Daddy is always so handsome.

647
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,070
But he looks better in person

648
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,150
than in this photo.

649
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,110
Don't you think

650
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,270
I'm better at taking photos?

651
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,950
Mom,

652
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,350
then why did you buy so many copies?

653
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,910
You don't understand.

654
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,790
I can't let

655
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,940
your dad's handsome look

656
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,220
distract the others.

657
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,270
I've heard the good news

658
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,310
about you and Dr. Ling.

659
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,070
See?

660
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,660
Why two rings?

661
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,670
But these two

662
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,020
are not as bright as the one before.

663
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,550
I didn't know

664
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,390
Dr. Yu was suffering

665
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,270
from weak eye-sights.

666
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,550
But why do I have two?

667
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:44,980
It's because

668
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,390
I'm no ordinary woman.

669
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,940
It took two rings

670
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,190
to tie me close to him.

671
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,270
Anyway,

672
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,630
Dr. Yu, just remember,

673
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,030
Ling Rui is mine

674
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,550
from now on.

675
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,540
I know.

676
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,230
Well,

677
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,310
do you need me to keep an eye on him

678
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,630
so the home-wreckers inside

679
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,070
and outside the hospital

680
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,350
won't seduce him?

681
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:07,950
What if

682
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,430
you are one of them?

683
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,870
Here's the deal.

684
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,870
I'm not interested in married men.

685
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,270
If someone's harassing him,

686
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,310
let me know at once.

687
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,990
Deal.

688
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,030
But…

689
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,430
What do you want?

690
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,030
3D Surgery Simulators.

691
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,950
I want three of those.

692
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,310
I'll settle for two.

693
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,150
One. At least one.

694
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,910
Two.

695
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:36,990
Cool.

696
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,670
Deal.

697
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,150
You must inform me firsthand.

698
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,230
I heard everything.

699
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,790
What was the deal?

700
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,670
I have to go now.

701
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,070
Don't forget my machines.

702
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,910
Dad.

703
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,990
Mom and that lady

704
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,230
made a deal.

705
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,270
A deal?

706
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,070
What deal?

707
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,550
Nothing.

708
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,790
I'm going to donate

709
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,420
some medical equipment to your hospital.

710
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,110
Really?

711
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,630
That's a good thing.

712
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,470
Why did you buy so many?

713
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,500
Because you're handsome.

714
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,990
I can't have enough of it.

715
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,750
But my photograph skill

716
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,740
is better.

717
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,870
-Of course.
-Yes.

718
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,590
Good-looking. Can't have enough of it.

719
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,270
-Can't have enough of it.
-Can't have enough of it.

720
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,870
Can't have enough of it.

721
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,550
Can't have enough of it.

722
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,630
Can't have enough of it.

723
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,950
It's so nice.

724
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,430
So nice.

725
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,540
I'm going to make breakfast.

726
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,470
Sleep in for a little.

727
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:23,950
Okay.

728
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,550
Ling Rui.

729
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,030
You've done so much for me.

730
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,750
Is there anything

731
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,990
I can do for you?

732
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,230
Aside from making breakfast,

733
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,590
you can do everything else for me.

734
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,470
What was that?

735
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,670
Is my cooking so awful?

736
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,950
Your cooking is amazing.

737
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,350
Fangning,

738
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,430
I need you

739
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,710
to be with me

740
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,590
when I'm happy

741
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,790
and sad.

742
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,230
I will.

743
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,940
When I'm hurt

744
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,030
and feel vulnerable.

745
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,630
I will.

746
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,870
Whether I'm successful

747
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,070
or hitting rock bottom.

748
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,030
I will.

749
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,350
When

750
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,030
I'm old

751
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,150
and ugly.

752
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,670
About that…

753
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,830
No promises.

754
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,030
What did you say?

755
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,190
I will

756
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,220
always be there for you.

757
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,470
Forever.

758
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,990

00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,150
♫ To prove that you'll always be my one and only ♫

772
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,710
♫ From now on, my heartbeat, pulse, and breath ♫

773
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,150
♫ exist only for you ♫

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:27,940
[Begin Again]
