00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,429
Here.

5
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:46,870
Check.

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,150
Uncle Hua?

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,520
-You are back.
-Having a walk?

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,670
Ling Rui is back.

9
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,550
I'm back.

10
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,120
-Ling Rui.
-Hello, Aunt Li.

11
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,200
Change another hand.

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,910
Sister Fang.

13
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,230
Use your left hand.

14
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,560
This way.

15
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,630
This way.

16
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,350
Then, use this.

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,070
Yes.

18
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,270
-Aunt.
-This shoulder.

19
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,030
You're off early.

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,950
-This shoulder.
-Yes.

21
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,360
Your mother

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,510
is promoting health knowledge again.

23
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,230
-Forward.
-Call her.

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,080
Revise what I taught today.

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,590
Mom!

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,270
Mom, are you done?

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,040
Yes.

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,110
Let's go home and have lunch.

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,390
Okay, where's my musical instrument?

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,870
My bag?

31
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,990
The bag's here.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,670
-Don't forget to practice.
-Okay.

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,430
-Bye.
-Bye.

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,910
Repeat 20 times.

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,920
Let's go.

36
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,710
Look at how bad this woman is.

37
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,480
I told you.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,790
I know the ending will be like this.

39
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,520
Look.

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,790
What's it, little aunt?

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,950
Ling Rui,

42
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm going to die.

43
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,390
So, you are saying that

44
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,430
the one who owed you four million yuan

45
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,760
is the aunt of Dr. Ling Rui.

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,510
Yes, sister.

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,950
Sister Yazhi told me that

48
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,120
she has a nephew named Ling Rui,

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,430
working as a surgeon in the city hospital.

50
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,510
And Sister Yazhi

51
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,550
is really good.

52
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,830
So, she is not going to

53
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,360
deny the debt.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,200
And, their aunt...

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,750
Shut up!

56
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,350
I took the little asset

57
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,790
your former uncle-in-law gave me
before the divorce.

58
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,790
And, I did some investment.

59
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,920
I lost all the money in it.

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,680
I also...

61
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,150
-Also...
-I also...

62
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,830
What?

63
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,120
I also owed four million yuan.

64
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,510
Now, they are urging me to return it.

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,150
I don't have the money.

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,080
Ling Rui, don't...

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't tell your mother

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,710
and my sister.

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,880
If they find out, I am doomed to die!

70
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,390
Okay, little aunt. Don't worry.

71
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,750
I will

72
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,230
deal with this.

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,830
Okay, okay.

74
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,470
Okay. No problem.

75
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,390
Okay. Goodbye.

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
Did you make an appointment with him?

77
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,510
Yes... Yeah.

78
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,870
He said we could meet tomorrow.

79
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,230
Well, sister.

80
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,030
Do you have any other orders?

81
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,190
This is the company.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,350
Call me Ms. Lu.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,230
Okay.

84
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,390
I'll pay attention to that in the future,

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
and call you Ms. Lu.

86
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,950
Four million yuan. Good job.

87
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,390
Sister...

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,790
It's so generous of you

89
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,070
by spending money like water.

90
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,870
Do you know how hard

91
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,470
your sister works?

92
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,910
Sister... Ms. Lu.

93
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,830
I was wrong

94
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,960
I'll go work at the store

95
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,510
right now.

96
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,110
I promise that

97
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,390
I'll do my best, for Deer Sing,

98
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,560
dad and you, with a

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,350
down-to-earth attitude.

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,430
Did you forget about your mother?

101
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes. For my mother too.

102
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,720
For my mother,

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,830
I need to put my life on

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,910
competing with you for the inheritance.

105
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,550
I'll give you

106
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,590
a great sense of accomplishment

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,870
in the process of defeating me.

108
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,510
Okay.

109
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,830
Just leave.

110
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,190
Sister...

111
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,390
Can I have my credit card back?

112
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,870
Get out!

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,310
Okay.

114
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,710
I'll get out of here right now.

115
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,590
Bye bye.

116
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,880
[Ling Rui]

117
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,190
Ling Rui.

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,440
[Aunt: Ling Yazhi]

119
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,470
You have nowhere to run.

120
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,590
[LM Deer Sing Group]

121
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,350
Lu Fangning,

122
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,990
General Manager of LM Deer Sing Group,

123
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,070
Lu Fangyu's sister,

124
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,790
and the creditor of your aunt, Ling Yazhi.

125
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,390
I'm the one you are responsible for.

126
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,470
Ms. Lu,

127
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm willing to

128
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,990
bear all the debt

129
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,830
on behalf of Ms. Ling Yazhi.

130
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,150
But, because the amount

131
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,870
is relatively huge,

132
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,230
it may take a while to pay off them.

133
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,550
I totally understand.

134
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,950
So,

135
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,040
can you give me an extension?

136
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,750
I came up with

137
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,470
an overall plan

138
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,600
for this problem.

139
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,550
An overall plan

140
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,720
that benefits both of us.

141
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,800
Let's make it to two million.

142
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,280
But, you need to marry me

143
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,550
for just one year only.

144
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,310
The two million

145
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,480
can be offset after a year.

146
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,360
You don't have to thank me.

147
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,150
I need a marriage

148
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,350
to deal with my family.

149
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
And, you're the right guy.

150
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,790
You don't have to thank me

151
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,960
for giving you this chance.

152
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,950
I'm sorry. I reject the offer.

153
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,950
Two million five hundred thousand yuan?

154
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,990
It's more than half of the debt.

155
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,790
Three million.

156
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,670
Three million a year.

157
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,910
It's several times your annual salary.

158
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,830
Think about it.

159
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,310
If we cooperate happily,

160
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,160
this will make a win-win situation.

161
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,720
Smooth.

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,710
Four million, all of it.

163
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:01,990
You just have to keep up

164
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,030
a year's marriage with me.

165
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,640
One year later, the debt will be

166
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,190
canceled.

167
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,230
I think I'd better go.

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,710
Later,

169
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,239
I'll think about

170
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,950
the specific repayment plan.

171
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,070
Then, I'll inform Ms. Lu.

172
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,869
You won't lose anything.

173
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,920
Wait! Wait!

174
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,359
Lu Fangning,

175
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
apologize to me.

176
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,000
This is a workplace.

177
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,480
Influencers are not welcome here.

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm not an influencer. I'm a celebrity.

179
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,990
They are the same.

180
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,630
Don't be too arrogant,

181
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,350
or I'll ask my father not to vote for you.

182
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,830
I'm so scared.

183
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,670
You!

184
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,950
Security.

185
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,150
Don't call security.

186
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,870
Security.

187
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,070
Don't do that.

188
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,470
Security.

189
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,880
Get this madman away from me.

190
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,470
How dare you say that!

191
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,200
Tang Pingping.

192
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,630
-Dad.
-Pingping.

193
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,830
You're looking for me?

194
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,680
-I...
-You're in the wrong place.

195
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,790
I was just there.

196
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,110
Fangning, you are here too.

197
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,790
Look at my silly girl.

198
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,150
She can't even remember where my office is.

199
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,950
Let's go.

200
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,950
I won't go.

201
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,320
I want her to apologize to me.

202
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,640
She broke my arm.

203
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,680
It really hurt!

204
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,110
Apologize for what?

205
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,200
Didn't you just twist it?

206
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,750
It's alright.

207
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,930
No.

208
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,560
Dad.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,910
Don't vote for her.

210
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,470
Okay, okay.

211
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,950
I won't. I won't.

212
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,270
Fangning, don't worry.

213
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,150
I'll definitely vote for you

214
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,950
at the next board meeting.

215
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,430
-Thank you, Uncle Tang.
-What did you say?

216
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,830
You!

217
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,470
-It hurts.
-Dad!

218
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,070
It hurts!

219
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,070
It hurts!

220
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,080
Mister, sit over there.

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,620
It hurts.

222
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,350
-Sit down first.
-Dad.

223
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,190
Come here.

224
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,190
-It hurts.
-Sit down first.

225
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,830
Mister,

226
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,680
are you feeling the pain in the upper chest

227
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,830
or the lower end?

228
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,990
Do you feel stuffy or tight?

229
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,760
I... I...

230
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,680
I didn't sleep well.

231
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,710
I'm afraid of getting angry.

232
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,630
Uncle Tang, drink some water.

233
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,710
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

234
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,230
Doctor,

235
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,640
how is my father?

236
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,270
You'd better take him to the hospital
as soon as possible

237
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,990
to do some detailed examination

238
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,590
in thoracic surgery
and internal medicine department.

239
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,870
So, you can know what's going on.

240
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,870
It hurts. It hurts.

241
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,470
Which department are you from?

242
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,910
I'm from the General Surgery Department.

243
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,430
General Surgery Department?

244
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,640
Then,

245
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
when are you usually at the hospital?

246
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,110
Dr. Ling,

247
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:53,910
I think

248
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,270
you can help with nothing here.

249
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,150
You can leave.

250
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,510
Mister,

251
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,070
remember to go to the hospital for a check-up.

252
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,750
Thanks.

253
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,880
Lu Fangning.

254
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,310
You brought such a

255
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,400
handsome guy here.

256
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,950
Do you have any agenda?

257
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,470
I'm asking you.

258
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,630
Why don't you come with us tonight?

259
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,150
I told you many times.

260
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,030
I'm not going.

261
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,310
Just go with me.

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,350
And it's me

263
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,160
who'll pay for it.

264
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,270
It's just a blind date.

265
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,630
I'm not going.

266
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,950
Okay.

267
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,350
What are you doing?

268
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,550
What are you doing with my food?

269
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,070
You don't eat the meat every time.

270
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,870
And, I don't have enough to eat.

271
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,750
It's not a big deal for me to eat some.

272
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,030
But, I have to eat it too.

273
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,750
But,

274
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,710
it's reasonable that nobody can get you

275
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,470
the most handsome guy of
General Surgery Department

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,430
merely through a blind date.

277
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,560
Especially, you're the most handsome guy

278
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,070
who is dedicated

279
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,190
to the medical cause.

280
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,750
Am I right?

281
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,710
Tell me something about it.

282
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,160
The lady behind the curtain...

283
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,880
Who is she? Why don't I know her?

284
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,510
She shouldn't be from our department.

285
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,480
Because I don't even know her.

286
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,870
And,

287
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,440
she shouldn't be a patient's next-of-kin.

288
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,270
You're not a person who does such a thing.

289
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,710
Stop it! Just eat.

290
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,750
Did anything happen at home?

291
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,750
I haven't seen the look

292
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,950
for a long time.

293
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,360
There's something wrong indeed.

294
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,470
It's the same bank account number, right?

295
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,670
What are you doing?

296
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,510
I'll send you the money.

297
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,680
The most probable cause to your problem

298
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,790
is money.

299
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,270
You don't have to do that.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
A huge amount?

301
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,670
More than your mortgage.

302
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,200
And, you're still in the mood to eat?

303
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,670
You...

304
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,150
Food is essential.

305
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,470
I don't want to waste it.

306
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,710
So what are you going to do?

307
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,230
I've already figured it out,

308
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,880
although

309
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,110
it's a little tricky.

310
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,390
Come on.

311
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,270
Let me send you some.

312
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,830
Or what if

313
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,190
you disappear someday.

314
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,670
If you, the most handsome guy
in the hospital, disappear,

315
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,790
where can I find you?

316
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,310
Why do you talk so much?

317
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,470
Don't talk nonsense and just eat.

318
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,870
You should know

319
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,270
to never trust repeated criminals.

320
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,990
Look at you.

321
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,070
What's the use of being so handsome?

322
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,160
It will be nice if a female boss

323
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,710
marries you one day.

324
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,950
Gao Erfan,

325
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,510
what do you think of my negotiation skills?

326
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,190
How is it?

327
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,550
There is no contract that you can't win.

328
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,280
Did my skill deteriorate?

329
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,270
You mean

330
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,990
yesterday's negotiations with
representatives of Yi Rui?

331
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,520
I think your performance

332
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,510
is perfect.

333
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,440
And all the terms

334
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,950
correspond to our goal.

335
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,310
I don't think there's any problem.

336
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,480
Then, who has a problem?

337
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,030
Ling Rui?

338
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,030
Dr. Ling?

339
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,310
What's wrong with him?

340
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,870
I offered to marry him

341
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,950
by raising the condition from

342
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,710
two million to four million.

343
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,750
But, he didn't want to accept it.

344
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,550
Why?

345
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,030
Well.

346
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,190
Say it.

347
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,430
Say it.

348
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,870
In my humble opinion, Ms. Lu...

349
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,750
You were negotiating a marriage,

350
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,990
not a business.

351
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,150
Imagine it.

352
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,310
If a man

353
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,350
tells you

354
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,430
how much money

355
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,510
he can give you

356
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,440
and how can both of you

357
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,670
make a win-win situation
when he's about to marry you,

358
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,030
will you feel happy?

359
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,270
I will.

360
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,590
Why not?

361
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,630
Bravo.

362
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,150
Then I...

363
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,640
Say it.

364
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,830
Ms. Lu,

365
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,870
my holiday and bonus for next month...

366
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,440
Say it.

367
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,840
Anything but money.

368
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
How and what to negotiate?

369
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,510
Sure enough, about true feelings.

370
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,120
Show him your true feelings

371
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,200
and enthusiasm.

372
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,880
We won't go to the company.

373
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,710
How about my bonus?

374
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,360
Where are you going after work?

375
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,070
I have something else

376
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,790
and I have work to do

377
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,830
afterward.

378
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,560
What can you have?

379
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,710
You are going home to work?

380
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,630
Come on.

381
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,350
Where are you going?

382
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,640
Dr. Ling.

383
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,190
Hello.

384
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,830
You...

385
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,990
I'm Tang Ping.

386
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,310
Ping is the...

387
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,510
An apple (Ping Guo) a day.

388
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,080
I remember.

389
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,190
Ms. Tang,

390
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,670
what can I do for you?

391
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,400
After you left,

392
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,430
I thought

393
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,000
I have a lot

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,150
to say to you.

395
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,830
Then...

396
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,080
You two go on. I'll go first.

397
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,520
Okay.

398
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,710
Ms. Tang,

399
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,070
you're not my patient.

400
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,350
If you're in need,

401
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,680
you can go to
the medical management department,

402
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,870
on the fifth floor of the East area.

403
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,350
We're leaving.

404
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,510
Dr. Ling.

405
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,270
No.

406
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,710
See.

407
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,310
I made this for you myself.

408
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,110
I'm giving it to you.

409
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,560
Thanks a lot.

410
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,110
Well...

411
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,070
Actually, it's not that good.

412
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,160
Bribery is

413
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,350
against the rules everywhere, right?

414
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
It's not for you.

415
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,510
We have work to do. We'll leave first.

416
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,430
Dr. Ling,

417
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,230
can't we just

418
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,200
be friends?

419
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,910
I'm afraid not.

420
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,590
Don't go.

421
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,390
Peng Bo, let's go.

422
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,310
Dr. Ling.

423
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,670
Lu Fangning, why are you here?

424
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,120
Such a coincidence!

425
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,039
You are not friends, are you?

426
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,150
Let me introduce her to you.

427
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,390
This is Tang Ping.

428
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,039
The ordinary Ping.

429
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,950
It's obviously the Ping
who likes him at first sight.

430
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,400
Nobody knows what you're saying.

431
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,870
You!

432
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,319
It's just the pretty Ping.

433
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,269
The ordinary Ping!

434
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,280
And, this is my man, Ling Rui.

435
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,010
What?

436
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,070
-I'm not. -That's impossible.

437
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,990
He... I like him first.

438
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,950
Then, why don't you build a castle

439
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,110
for him?

440
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,150
Tang Ping.

441
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,310
How dare you

442
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,190
snatch my "future husband"?

443
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,390
What can you do about it

444
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,000
even he's your "father"?

445
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,990
Tang Pingping.

446
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,830
You're really getting bolder and bolder.

447
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,280
That's who I am.

448
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,070
Dare you touch me again?

449
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,640
-Okay!
-Again?

450
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,440
Okay!

451
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,080
-Again?
-Hey, ladies.

452
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,520
-Okay!
-Ladies...

453
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,630
Ladies, we're at the hospital.

454
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,310
Shut up!

455
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,510
Stop acting.

456
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,430
He's neither stupid nor blind.

457
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,110
He can see through your acting skills.

458
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,070
Dr. Ling.

459
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,590
Today, I am here

460
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,000
to talk about

461
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,550
the unfinished topic

462
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,840
last time.

463
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,790
This is for you.

464
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,030
Come with me.

465
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,430
Did you hear that?

466
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,400
He asked me to go with him.

467
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,710
Don't be arrogant!

468
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,040
Come back.

469
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,350
This patient...

470
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,360
How about

471
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,840
I'll take you to
the medical management department

472
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,150
or the Orthopedics Department?

473
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
No, thank you.

474
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,590
Get out of my way.

475
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,950
Please, marry me.

476
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,230
Ms. Lu.

477
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,110
I think

478
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,950
I've made it very clear before.

479
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,710
You can ask me some

480
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,750
normal questions now.

481
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,150
For example, why did I choose you?

482
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,790
Never mind. You don't have to talk.

483
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,350
Let me tell you.

484
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,390
We met three times before.

485
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,270
You have a good personality,

486
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,240
body, and vigor.

487
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,550
I'm very satisfied with...

488
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm moved.

489
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,030
Ling Rui.

490
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,630
I'm being serious.

491
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,200
The heart is on the left.

492
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,190
Ms. Lu.

493
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,280
I still want to discuss my repayment plan

494
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,630
with you.

495
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,950
Are you serious?

496
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,390
This isn't

497
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,390
a simple thing.

498
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,390
I can't believe there's someone

499
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,160
who takes the initiative
to pay back money these days.

500
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,550
Why?

501
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,110
Your dignity?

502
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,760
Actually, you don't have to do this.

503
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,990
In the matter of gender equality,

504
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,030
we can try

505
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,270
to materialize it.

506
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,910
I know you don't have much savings.

507
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,920
All of your money

508
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,510
has been donated to charity

509
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,080
in various names

510
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,390
since you started working.

511
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,470
But, it doesn't matter.

512
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,840
I allow you to use me,

513
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,350
in the name of Lu Fangning's husband.

514
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,000
Thus, we can help more people

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,350
to get more the help they need.

516
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,430
I know you are going to Germany.

517
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,710
-We can...
-Ms. Lu.

518
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,150
I do want

519
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,360
to help more people

520
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,240
and realize

521
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,390
my dream.

522
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,430
But I won't

523
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,590
break my rules for this.

524
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,310
Marriage is not a business.

525
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,720
There's no shortcut to anything.

526
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,750
Marriage is originally the reorganization of

527
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,790
two families.

528
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,160
This isn't a shortcut at all.

529
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,430
This is for the better.

530
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,990
You should render great love in your heart.

531
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,230
You should render
the spirit of sacrifice and dedication.

532
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,320
So I have to sacrifice my marriage?

533
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,270
To you?

534
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,080
Definitely.

535
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,070
Thank you for helping my family.

536
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,990
Also, please.

537
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,120
Stop mentioning it again

538
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,110
in the future.

539
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,910
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

540
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,390
And,

541
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,270
Ms. Lu,

542
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,950
please don't tell

543
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,790
my family about this.

544
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,040
I don't want them to worry.

545
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,750
This flower

546
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,470
can't be put in the ward.

547
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,120
Ms. Lu, please take it back.

548
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,830
Thanks.

549
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,790
Sure enough, it's fragile

550
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,150
and useless.

551
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,430
Just a waste of money.

552
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,390
Ms. Lu.

553
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,240
Do you want to call Lawyer Deng?

554
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,520
Lawyer?

555
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,310
Yeah.

556
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,750
It's natural

557
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,030
to let lawyers handle the debt collection.

558
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,430
Let me think about it again.

559
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,550
Go out.

560
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,470
So embarrassing.

561
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,270
Pingping.

562
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,430
Let dad tell you something.

563
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,910
Don't go to the company

564
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,390
when you're free.

565
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,160
Don't act perfunctorily!

566
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,280
If you go a few more times,

567
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,750
my heart, liver, and my lungs

568
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,670
can't stand that anymore.

569
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,390
Dad, you're not that weak.

570
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,240
What's the matter?

571
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,920
What did you just say?

572
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,190
I said

573
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,520
my heart, liver, and my lungs... What's wrong?

574
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,310
Dad,

575
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,590
you are ill.

576
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,550
No.

577
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,310
I'm just getting old

578
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,910
and feel a bit out of breath.

579
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,590
The great doctor

580
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,550
said before

581
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,110
that you were really ill.

582
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,910
I am fine.

583
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,910
I eat and sleep well.

584
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,830
There's nothing wrong with me.

585
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,510
You're ill. You have to go to the hospital.

586
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,350
I'm not ill. I'm not going to the hospital.

587
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,600
You are. You're going to the hospital.

588
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,670
I'm not ill.

589
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,790
No. Let's go to the hospital.

590
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,040
Just go. You're ill.

591
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,630
There isn't much problem.

592
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,670
Just go home and have a good rest.

593
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,790
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

594
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,280
Dad, come in.

595
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,830
Dr. Ling.

596
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:48,750
Hello.

597
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,830
You...

598
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,800
Didn't you ask my dad to see a doctor

599
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
last time?

600
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,310
So, I brought him here.

601
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,590
Have a seat.

602
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,310
But this is the General Surgery Department.

603
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,310
You're so skillful.

604
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,870
Of course, my father trusts you.

605
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,270
Isn't that, dad?

606
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,310
Yes.

607
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,000
Alright.

608
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,830
I'll help mister to make an appointment

609
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,920
for some examinations.

610
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,710
And we'll know which department to go to

611
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,390
after the test results come out.

612
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Ling.

613
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,070
You're welcome.

614
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,790
Dr. Ling.

615
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,150
I brought you

616
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,480
coffee.

617
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,990
I can't take this. Thanks.

618
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,190
It's just a cup of coffee.

619
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,510
This is my sincere thought.

620
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,870
Can't you even accept it?

621
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,310
You can leave it here.

622
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,670
Thanks.

623
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,700
Okay.

624
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,730
Not me,

625
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,230
but Tang Ping?

626
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,030
Gao Erfan, get in here.

627
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,110
Ms. Lu.

628
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,640
Call Lawyer Deng.

629
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,230
Now.

630
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,100
[Reciprocal Account Name: Peng Bo]

631
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,990
Don't come in.

632
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,190
If you dare to come in,

633
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,600
you are trespassing.

634
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,350
Stop.

635
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,830
I will tell the TV station to expose you.

636
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,790
Yea.

637
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,630
You... Don't move.

638
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,670
If you dare touch me,

639
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,910
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

640
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,190
I have filmed it.

641
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,990
What's the matter?

642
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,960
Mr. Ling Rui, right?

643
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,510
Yes, I am.

644
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,720
Hello, Mr. Ling Rui.

645
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,270
I'm entrusted by my client

646
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,110
to collect

647
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,150
Miss Ling Yazhi's

648
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,950
debts of four million yuan.

649
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,310
Given her financial situation,

650
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,200
we think it is necessary

651
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,950
to know about her family's repayment ability.

652
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,910
If it's determined that
she is incapable of repaying,

653
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,840
we'll bring up a reasonable lawsuit

654
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,950
shortly.

655
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,160
What?

656
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,310
What... Four million yuan?

657
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,720
What's going on?

658
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,110
Ling Yazhi, you...

659
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,190
Where's your client?

660
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,630
My client is downstairs.

661
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,510
You have her business card.

662
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,830
You should know what to do.

663
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,030
What's going on?

664
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,390
Lu Fangning.

665
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,920
Yes?

666
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,670
Do you want to punch me?

667
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
Ling Rui.

668
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,710
Usually,

669
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,710
I don't give

670
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,790
anybody a second chance.

671
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,430
But, I can make an exception

672
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,070
for you.

673
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,670
No.

674
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,560
This confirmed

675
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,110
my decision to reject you.

676
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,310
You only want to achieve your goal

677
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,110
and impose your will on others.

678
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,870
You keep saying that you want to get married.

679
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,310
But do you know the feeling of

680
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,510
love and being loved?

681
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,320
Do you know

682
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,760
the importance of family to a person?

683
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,080
You only think about yourself.

684
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,390
But you disregard

685
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,600
other's feelings and wishes.

686
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,910
If you care,

687
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
you won't easily

688
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,510
hurt other people's families.

689
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,750
You're a debtor.

690
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,430
You've no right to judge me.

691
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,840
Lu Fangning,

692
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,910
you are a selfish and

693
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,630
childish person.

694
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,470
Fangning,

695
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,640
will you stop

696
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,790
being childish?

697
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,480
Enjoy your food.

698
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,310
Let's eat.

699
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,590
A great day begins in the morning.

700
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,030
I got up early in the morning

701
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,680
to prepare this.

702
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,510
But all of you don't even appreciate it.

703
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,720
Even you're worried,

704
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,360
you have to eat.

705
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,950
Am I right?

706
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,150
Mom!

707
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,760
You always say

708
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
people live on meals.

709
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,680
I promise you, okay?

710
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,670
If it doesn't work out in the end,

711
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,750
I will ask you for help.

712
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,190
I was waiting for you to say this.

713
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,910
I've thought it through.

714
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,070
I... I have to find another house.

715
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,430
Or we'll have no space

716
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,240
for these things

717
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,750
if this house is mortgaged,

718
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,560
am I right?

719
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,390
Zhang Aidi has a house.

720
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,190
It seems that I have to

721
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,110
talk to this woman again.

722
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,710
I did some math.

723
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,680
I can help gather a little

724
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,990
by withdrawing the investment money.

725
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,270
Ling Rui can earn it back

726
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,350
for me.

727
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,150
Am I right, Ling Rui?

728
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,630
Sure enough.

729
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,880
All right, let's eat.

730
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,470
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy.

731
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,470
Let's eat.

732
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,480
Aunt,

733
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,920
there are the freshly made fried dough sticks.

734
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,590
Try it.

735
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,240
-Okay.
-This is freshly made.

736
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,470
The dumpling looks tasty too.

737
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,110
I'll start with this.

738
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,550
It's delicious!

739
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,430
It's delicious!

740
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,710
Is it delicious?

741
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,710
Yes.

742
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,910
Yes.

743
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,150
Is it delicious?

744
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,960
-Nice?
-Ouch.

745
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,510
-Mom, why are you pinching me?
-Does it hurt?

746
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,430
-Harder!
-It hurts!

747
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,550
-Harder!
-It should hurt.

748
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:29,990
It hurts!

749
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,910
Let him remember this.

750
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,550
I tell you.

751
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,390
He should tell us

752
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,030
whenever he's in trouble.

753
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,030
If you dare lie to me again,

754
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,550
I'll force you to marry

755
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,080
the cousin's daughter of

756
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,030
the aunt who lives next door to Zhang Aidi.

757
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,870
Believe it or not?

758
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,840
I believe!

759
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,230
-Do you? Do you?
-I do!

760
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,360
-Stop pinching.
-Does it hurt?

761
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,750
It really hurts!

762
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,670
Aunt Wang's

763
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,030
uncle's daughter?

764
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,990
Another aunt's daughter

765
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,610
is okay too.

766
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay?

767
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,880
I was wrong.

768
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,070
I was wrong.

769
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,790
What about me?

770
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,550
It was my fault.

771
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,430
Why didn't you scold me?

772
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,590
You can beat me too.

773
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,760
Nice try.

774
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,750
Do you know

775
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,070
what's the worst punishment?

776
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,470
It's that you obviously made a mistake,

777
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,990
but you don't get punished, right?

778
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,950
How hard it is for you!

779
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,350
Think about it.

780
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,230
Yes.

781
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,560
That's the greatest pain

782
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,390
in the world.

783
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,230
Let's eat.

784
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,030
Mom, eat the bamboo shoot.

785
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,550
Delicious.

786
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,790
You just ignore me. I'll eat by myself.

787
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,550
Come.

788
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,990
Little aunt, eat this.

789
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,510
It's delicious!

790
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,670
The shrimp dumplings are made very well today.

791
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,110
Right?

792
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,790
Mr. Yang.

793
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,590
Ms. Lu.

794
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,240
It's been a while.

795
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,990
Have a seat.

796
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,790
Have a seat.

797
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,840
What would you like to drink?

798
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,550
Two hot lattes.

799
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,830
Okay, just a moment, please.

800
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,910
Stop touching your "glib tongue".

801
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,120
Can you look at the waiter and talk?

802
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
Didn't anyone teach you manners?

803
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,310
I don't want to drink a latte.

804
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,879
I've been looking for a chance

805
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,390
to talk with Ms. Lu.

806
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,830
What for?

807
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,510
Ms. Lu,

808
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,310
you run Deer Sing Group so well.

809
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,109
But a woman like you

810
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:31,550
may not truly understand about

811
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,480
how to run a business.

812
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,189
Ling Rui wouldn't say such stupid things.

813
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,550
Thanks.

814
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,520
You're welcome.

815
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,600
Thanks.

816
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,910
Oh, no!

817
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,990
I'm starting to hallucinate.

818
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,870
Professor,

819
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,600
we've been in the hospital all-day.

820
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,870
But you asked me to come here after work.

821
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,150
Is there anything you want to say to me?

822
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,200
You should be the one

823
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,190
who has something to say to me, right?

824
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,190
Peng Bo told you?

825
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,750
You should have told me first,

826
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,550
not him.

827
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,590
He barely has spare money.

828
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,200
Don't worry.

829
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,750
About money,

830
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,230
I'm not very good at it,

831
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,840
but

832
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,190
my wife manages it well.

833
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,680
Take it.

834
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,760
Thank you, sir.

835
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,310
But I can handle this

836
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,030
by myself.

837
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,630
You're still so stubborn.

838
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,710
I knew it would be like this.

839
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,030
I...

840
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,070
I'm just trying to carry out my duty.

841
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,640
I know.

842
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,630
You can deal with everything.

843
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,160
Okay.

844
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,840
Let's get down to business.

845
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,910
How is

846
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,950
the German Institute going?

847
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,480
A new subject

848
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,960
has already been declared.

849
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,750
Then, there can be no further delay.

850
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,760
Pancreatic cancer has always been

851
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,190
a difficult problem to overcome
for General Surgery Department.

852
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,430
Your father's illness

853
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,710
is also the root of your medical study.

854
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,630
Over the years,

855
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,990
you always want to

856
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,750
do research there.

857
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,110
Don't be distracted by other things.

858
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,110
Ms. Lu.

859
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,670
Is there anything

860
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,830
you want to say to me?

861
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,070
Ms. Lu.

862
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,230
Ms. Lu.

863
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,470
I came here because

864
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,000
I hope that you and Director Yang

865
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,430
can vote for me

866
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,870
at the board meeting.

867
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,080
I knew it.

868
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
What can I get in return?

869
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,350
I can assure you

870
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
after Infinity passed the voting,

871
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,870
the company's profit

872
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,350
will at least double in the next year.

873
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't tell me these baseless things.

874
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,310
No one can tell what will happen next year.

875
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,470
How about this?

876
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,470
I'll sign a contract with you in private.

877
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,550
If I can't achieve

878
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,910
our goals,

879
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,110
I can give you

880
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,270
a share of my equity.

881
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,680
Fangning.

882
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,830
You know what I want.

883
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,870
You know that.

884
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,680
I don't know.

885
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,950
I have a proposal

886
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,150
that satisfies both parties.

887
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,470
I've no idea.

888
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
Would you like to hear it?

889
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,680
Well, maybe I can help you.

890
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,350
Go to my penthouse

891
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,520
and I'll tell you in detail.

892
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,110
By the way,

893
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,510
did you put the drugs on the nightstand?

894
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,430
You should know

895
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,750
I made an appointment with Lu Fangning,

896
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,390
right here at the penthouse.

897
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,670
Yes.

898
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,080
I'll use it later.

899
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,070
I'll grab a bottle of wine before I go up.

900
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,320
And let her have a "taste".

901
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,170
Okay.

902
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,190
Fangning,

903
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,150
I rent

904
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,190
this room all year round.

905
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,670
How's the environment?

906
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,760
Do you like it?

907
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,110
Pretty good.

908
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,230
Come, drink some water.

909
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,030
Thanks.

910
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:48,990
By the way,

911
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,230
Mr. Yang, the idea you said

912
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,030
that can satisfy both parties,

913
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,910
what is it?

914
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,830
We're not rushing.

915
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,000
Since we're here,

916
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,590
let's talk about something else.

917
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,510
Drink some water first.

918
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,710
Excuse me.

919
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,870
Hello.

920
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,800
Ms. Lu.

921
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,110
There's an appointment with...

922
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,350
I'm in a meeting.

923
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,150
I know. I will be there.

924
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,030
Send me the exact time

925
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,630
and place.

926
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,510
Okay, don't worry.

927
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:31,990
I'm hanging up.

928
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,150
Ms. Lu is really busy.

929
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,630
Indeed.

930
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,950
So, let's make a long story short.

931
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,070
Mr. Yang, can you tell me

932
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,230
the proposal now?

933
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,870
Let's get married.

934
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,350
Get... Get married?

935
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,110
Don't you have a wife?

936
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,910
It doesn't matter.

937
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,550
As long as you agree,

938
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,230
I can divorce her.

939
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,590
But...

940
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,030
Fangning, don't hesitate.

941
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,670
I know your dad

942
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,750
always forces you to go on blind dates

943
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,520
and wants you to give birth to a child.

944
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,280
Instead of marrying a person

945
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,080
you don't like,

946
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,360
you should marry me.

947
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,590
We can cooperate and run the business well.

948
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,830
Think about it.

949
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,110
Your current shares in Deer Sing

950
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,360
and the Yang family's share

951
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,310
can bring LM Deer Sing Group

952
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,990
a bright future that is under our control.

953
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,110
Forget about Infinity.

954
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,990
We can create ten of them,

955
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,910
and still have a smooth sail.

956
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,190
But,

957
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,510
there are no feelings between us.

958
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,590
Marriage is not necessarily

959
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,430
based on feelings.

960
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,910
You get what you want,

961
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,510
and I get what I want.

962
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,110
Isn't that quite good?

963
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,470
Let's work together.

964
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
Ms. Lu.
