It was Dr. Ling who

took her away just now.

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,890

00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
We're here for shopping, of course.

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are we here if not for shopping?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,920
Shopping is fine,

It's been six years,

but Ling Rui didn't even look for a girlfriend.

41
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,720
It's been 16 years,

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,400

Mom doesn't know about it. You're a coward.

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,730
If Lu Fangning knows it,

63
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,960
she'll surely kill me.

64
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,000
Lu Fangning?

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,120
This is Lu Fangning's child?

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,529
Murder is a crime.

67
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,610
Mom won't commit a crime because of you.

68
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,720
I know that.

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,490
But

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,610
she'll make me feel agonized.

Since you're so afraid of her,

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,050
how can you be my father?

73
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,520
He's the father of Lu Fangning's child.

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,529
I don't deserve to be your father.

-It has nothing to do with you.

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,050
What is it? No.

78
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,770
This is the father of Lu Fangning's child.

79
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,010
Why does she have a child?

Let's go.

84
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,490
It has nothing to do with us.

85
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,250
Then let me ask you.

86
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,930
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,280
I came to look for dad.

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,520
Mom is unreliable.

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,690
So I have to rely on myself.

90
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,090
Looking for dad?

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,530
Then why did you come to LM Deer Sing Store?

92
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,210
Didn't mom

94
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,410
You know everything.

95
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,010
Let me ask you again.

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,930
There're so many people

97
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,370
here,

98
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,770
how do you know who your father is?

99
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,250
Of course it relies on the

100
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,130
telepathic connection between a father and a son.

101
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,800
What are you doing?

102
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,530
I'm sensing it.

103
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,690
You little kid.

104
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,010
Take it for me.

105
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,130

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,210
He's at home?

107
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,480
Remember not to mention it.

108
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,560
If you do...

109
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,450
You're back?

110
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,770
Ling Rui is back?

111
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,210
The dishes are ready.

112
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,810
When my mom comes back,

113
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,770
we can start eating.

114
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,640
Okay.

115
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,490
Ling Rui.

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,290
Why are you

117
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,880
having potato chips?

118
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,640
I thought you never ate snacks?

119
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,490
You're in a good mood today?

120
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,120
Not bad.

121
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,490
I'm like this every day.

122
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,610
What happened to you?

123
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,770

Ling Rui.

128
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,490
Listen to my advice.

129
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,330
It's been so many years,

130
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,050
and she also has her own life.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,560
You should also start

133
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,090
Aunt, in fact...

134
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,080
Ling Rui,

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,890

Sister.

138
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,210
Why are you screaming?

139
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,570
You scared me to death.

140
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,440
Didn't you tell me not to say?

141
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,440
Well...

142
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,930
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,650
No, you can't say it.

144
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,560
You can't say it.

145
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,890

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
Say it.

You can ask your little aunt.

157
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,370
Sister, Ling Rui is angry.

158
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,760
What should we do? He's angry now.

159
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,330
What's the matter with you?

160
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,090
You didn't let me talk about it, but you did so yourself.

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
He has already met Lu Fangning.

162
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,920
Even if I don't say it, he'll know it sooner or later.

163
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,290
What should we do now?

164
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,880
Well...

165
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,130
How about this?

166
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,410
You just ask

167
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,280
the girl who is to your liking

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,090
out tomorrow.

169
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,650
That's great. Just keep wearing this.

170
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,570
When your mom sees you later,

171
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,530
her heart will melt right away.

172
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,520
Youyou.

173
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,960
Uncle Doll.

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,730
You're so good.

175
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,480
What a coincidence, Dr. Ling.

176
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,330
Let me do the introduction. This is my son.

177
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,650
Little kid,

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,650
is your mom

180
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,530
Yes, Uncle Doll.

181
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,200
Dr. Ling, you're leaving?

182
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,650
Aren't you going in,

183
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,810
Dr. Ling?

184
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,600
Youyou,

185
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,130
you know that person

186
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,610
who appeared just now, right?

187
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,530
He's Uncle Doll who looks like dad.

188
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,210
Let me tell you.

189
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,770
Don't tell

190
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,170
what happened just now

191
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,520
to your mom for the sake of our lives.

192
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,400
Got it?

193
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,090
You little kid.

194
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,860
Let's go.

195
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,170
I haven't changed my number, too.

196
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,610
Remember that.

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,610
You're back?

198
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,080
Mom, we went out today to...

199
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,050
It's fine.

200
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,800
Kids

201
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,810
just need to

202
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,880
go out and have fun more

203
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,210
to see what the world outside is like.

204
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,130
How about this?

205
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,930
If you want to go out and have fun

206
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,120
next time,

207
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,290
you can just tell me

208
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,250
or Uncle Shen Zhuo,

209
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,040
okay?

210
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,800
Then I'll go to wash my hands and read.

211
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,040
You're so good.

212
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,970
Go now.

213
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,880
Look how sensible my son is.

214
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,770
He even takes care of his own cleanliness.

215
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,130
Shen Zhuo.

216
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,170
Fangning.

217
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,650
I've thought about it.

218
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,130
Before that,

219
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,170
90 percent of the profit would go to me,

220
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,360
and that was really not fair.

221
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,730
How about this?

222
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,250
I...

223
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,040
Just 80 percent of the profit will go to me.

224
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,450
Don't be too grateful to me.

225
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,760
It's good.

226
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,160
Thank you, boss. I'm so appreciative.

227
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,960
But Fangning,

228
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,570
what did you do

229
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,250
with Dr. Ling

230
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,450
in the hospital today?

231
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,410
What could we do in the hospital?

232
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,690
We just talked about the past.

233
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,560
Talking about the past? Then you and him...

234
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,050
Have you told him

235
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,650
that you have

236
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,730
a five-year-old son?

237
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,810
I haven't said yet.

238
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,330
It'll be something unexpected for him.

239
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,370
I think it'll be

240
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,650
mind-blowing for him.

241
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,240
-It'll not be good for his health.
-Yes.

242
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,730
How about this?

243
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,010
After that,

244
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,640
I'll talk to him

245
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,280
about this properly at a suitable time.

246
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,490
But the most important thing now

247
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,610
is to trigger the feelings of the past.

248
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,090
Everything will be easy to deal with once there's a good relationship.

249
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,800
Right?

250
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,610
What are you thinking?

251
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,170
Didn't you still

252
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,080
think about escaping earlier?

253
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,850
I'm not going to care about you two anymore.

254
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,330
You're leaving?

255
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm going back to design.

256
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,850
If there's nothing important,

257
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,970
don't ever come to me.

258
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,490
It'll affect my work.

259
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,370
Ling Rui,

260
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,840
I seem to owe you a meal.

261
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,720
Is my phone or his

262
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,450
out of order?

263
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,330
Mom.

264
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,560
You're awake?

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,610
-Get up.
-Let's have a hug.

266
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,890
Happy weekend, baby.

267
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,210
I don't want to go to my little grandpa's house.

268
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,490
All right.

269
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,090
Just take it that little grandpa is getting old

270
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,800
and be considerate of him.

271
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,130
Where do you want to go?

272
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,330
Amusement park.

273
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,850
-Amusement park.
-Amusement park?

274
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,690
You scared me to death.

275
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,450
Do you think he's fine?

276
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,010
You go and ask.

277
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,840
Thank you.

278
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,480
Ling Rui, are you okay?

279
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,170
I'm fine.

280
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,120
You...

281
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,730
You're really fine?

282
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,010
I'm really fine.

283
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,090
Aunt is not in a good mood today.

284
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,690
Ling Rui,

285
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,290
regarding what I just told you,

286
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:07,930
what do you think?

287
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,810
Just go and join in.

288
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,890
You just go and meet the girl

289
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,730
considering that two of your aunts

290
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,490
are very worried and guilty now.

291
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,040
It doesn't matter if you don't like her.

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,250
You can turn her down when you come back.

293
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,650
Just go and meet her, okay?

294
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,080
Ling Rui?

295
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,970
Okay.

296
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,250
I'm full.

297
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,010
-It's done.
-Okay.

298
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,010
Let's go.

299
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,250
The 98th time.

300
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,200
I got together with the boss.

301
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,250
The 99th time.

302
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,470
[Cai Siyu's Weibo]

303
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,210
The 100th time.

304
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,890
A new day has started.

305
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,130
It's already the tenth day.

306
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,210
Why can't I think of

307
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,000
a fantastic beginning?

308
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,050
Coming.

309
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,200
Lu Yiyao?

310
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,560
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,410
I'm looking for you for something.

312
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,330
Mr. Lu Yiyao.

313
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,010
What are you going to do

314
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,890
at such an early time?

315
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,810
To stroll around.

316
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,410
Let me ask you something.

317
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,490
Six years ago,

318
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,650
we two...

319
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,490
Had we...

320
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
What are you going to say?

321
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,930
Had we...

322
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,050
-Slept...
-Had we slept together?

323
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,090
No.

324
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,890
For this question, six years ago,

325
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,130
I'd already answered you.

326
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,000
Then what you wrote on Weibo

327
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,050
wasn't like that.

328
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,050
[Damn.]

329
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,840
[I just wrote it on the spur of the moment.]

330
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,370
[I forgot that there's also another party.]

331
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,290
That was because I wanted to clear

332
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,450
myself of the accusation of plagiarism.

333
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,120
I simply wrote it.

334
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,400
You simply wrote it?

335
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,290
Your tone was so serious.

336
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,650
Obviously, you did it on the spur of the moment.

337
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,330
How could there be any premeditation?

338
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,130
I can't even remember

339
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,810
the memories from six years ago clearly.

340
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,160
I might get it wrong

341
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,960
at that particular moment.

342
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,130
How could someone like you,

343
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,090
who treats a relationship so seriously,

344
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,800
get it wrong?

345
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,450
Lu Yiyao.

346
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,210
You already believed it six years ago.

347
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,730
Why do you even care about it now?

348
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,170
Does it matter?

349
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,450
I didn't get pregnant and give birth

350
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,640
by keeping it from you.

351
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,050
I also didn't make a fuss everywhere.

352
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,170
I just used this

353
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,970
as a source of inspiration

354
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,690
to write a novel

355
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,200
and make a small amount of money.

356
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,240
Couldn't I do so?

357
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,570
I just want to know the truth.

358
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,330
Okay, the truth.

359
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,250
The truth...

360
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,210
Come here.

361
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,010
You don't believe the truth I said.

362
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,130
What is it?

363
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,640
Are you disgruntled now?

364
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,360
Then you should cherish it more at that time.

365
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,810
Cai Siyu.

366
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,970
Well, how could you...

367
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,010
What's wrong with me?

368
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,120
You came here by yourself.

369
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:28,840
Tell me.

370
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,770
So what if it's real?

371
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,930
So what if it's fake?

372
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,650
Don't tell me that you want to be held responsible

373
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,520
and marry me?

374
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,530
You thought I'd be very happy?

375
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:38,680
Scumbag!

376
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,770
How could I not want to?

377
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,570
I endured for a week.

378
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,690
I endured it a hundred times.

379
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,040
Do you know

380
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,810
what I'm thinking every day?

381
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,960
I miss you every day.

382
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,760
You're all over

383
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,330
my mind.

384
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,440
What do you want me to do?

385
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,640
What nonsense.

386
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,920
I didn't ask you to miss me.

387
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,170
I got it.

388
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,770
Are you aging?

389
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,170
So you're reminiscing about the old times.

390
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,050
I'm getting old?

391
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,640
Let me think

392
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,810
how much older are you than me.

393
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,450
Uncle.

394
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,850
-Un...
-No.

395
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,530
I should call you old uncle.

396
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,770
Are you going to be in menopause soon?

397
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,690
You're calling me old uncle?

398
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,210
Old uncle.

399
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,010
If there's nothing else,

400
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,160
please leave my house now.

401
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,640
The door is there. See you.

402
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,290
But you...

403
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,090
You haven't told me yet.

404
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,000
What to tell you?

405
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,810
I'm very busy.

406
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,130
I'm free.

407
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,240
That's good.

408
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,890
You help me to do the cleaning then.

409
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,730
You...

410
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,170
I...

411
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,120
Don't want.

412
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,530
[Why is he staring at me?]

413
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,680
[There's nothing to look at.]

414
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,760
[Why is he still looking at me?]

415
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,490
[Still looking at me?]

416
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,880
I'm heading out.

417
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,920
Where are you going?

418
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,640
It's none of your business. I'm very busy.

419
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,170
I'm free.

420
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,250
Just do whatever you want.

421
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,080
Don't follow me.

422
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,610
No peeking.

423
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,610
Don't follow me.

[Marketing Content]

425
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,210
How is it?

426
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,600
Are you satisfied with the marketing content?

427
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,210
Ms. Cai, it's like this.

428
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,810
The content is very good.

429
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,690
It's very natural and provocative.

430
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,050
It's just that...

431
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,250
What's wrong?

432
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,090
I've revised several times

433
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,490
based on

434
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,930
your requests.

435
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,850
You were involved in an issue

436
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,930
of plagiarism on Weibo before.

437
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,650
Our boss

438
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,250
is a bit concerned.

439
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,370
I already clarified

440
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,650
that others slandered me.

441
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,890
I know.

442
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,080
But to dispel

443
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,210
the company's doubts...

444
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,890
How about this?

445
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,810
Take a look.

446
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,520
[Service Agreement for Content Marketing]

447
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,210
This price

448
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,690
takes into account the reading amount.

449
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,130
It'll be free of charge if it's not up to par.

450
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,930
Look, we won't force you.

451
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,610
If you feel that it's inappropriate,

452
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,690
you can turn it down.

453
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,530
Before this,

454
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,530
I started writing because

455
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,850
the terms had been confirmed.

456
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,240
I changed it so many times

457
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,680
also because we trusted each other.

458
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,650
I spent so much

459
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,360
time and energy.

460
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,930
-But you gave me...
-Ms. Cai.

461
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,810
I also can't decide on this.

462
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,050
The boss has been insisting on that.

463
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,370
I've got no choice as well.

464
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,850
You're...?

465
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,010
The actual person.

466
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,530
The actual person in Ms. Cai's novel.

467
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,330
The boss who got together with her.

468
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,360
Hello.

469
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,570
Hello.

470
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,240
This is the contract?

471
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,730
Right.

472
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,450
Let me have a look.

473
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,290
If the reading amount is not up to par,

474
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,970
Party A has the right not to pay remuneration to Party B.

475
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,330
Then does Party B have the right to delete

476
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,770
the promotion offered by Party A?

477
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,090
Moreover, in this contract,

478
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,680
there're many unreasonable clauses.

479
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
In order to protect Ms. Cai's

480
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
legal rights,

481
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,810
I need to look for a lawyer.

482
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,530
Moreover,

483
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,370
based on the contract signed between both parties before,

484
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,520
Ms. Cai has fulfilled her duties,

485
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,570
but she didn't get the corresponding pay.

486
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,610
So I need to look for a lawyer.

487
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,250
Then I'll go back and ask the boss again.

488
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,890
Ms. Cai, I'll make a move first.

489
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,170
Wait.

490
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,010
Please ask your boss

491
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,320
to talk to my lawyer

492
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,290
if there's anything in the future.

493
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,650
Goodbye.

494
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,360
Party B.

495
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm Party B.

496
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,050
You thought I didn't want to scold him?

497
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,610
I even wanted to hit him.

498
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,450
But I still need to make a living.

499
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,170
Why did you come and create the chaos?

500
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,400
Lu Yiyao,

501
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,840
you weren't like this before.

502
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,610
Then I...

503
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,410
You can't help but tend to talk more now.

504
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,890
Is it because you're getting older?

505
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,450
No.

506
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,970
You...

507
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,370
You said I'm old?

508
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,650
I'm exactly referring to you, old man.

509
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,350
Move aside.

510
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,810
I don't want to.

511
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,810
Move aside.

512
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,970
Don't you understand?

513
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,480
No.

514
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,770
Wait for me.

515
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,610
Let's move the thoracic spine.

516
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,280
Is this still okay?

517
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,720
Come, make a turn.

518
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,240
Okay, change to the other side.

519
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:54,760
Come.

520
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,930
He even touches her?

521
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,930
Okay.

522
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,770
Next, let's have an

523
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,770
exercise for the hip joint.

524
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,530
Step on it and move forward.

525
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,720
Correct.

526
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,370
Lower your center of gravity even more.

527
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,130
Keep your back straight.

528
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,290
Tighten the abdominal core.

529
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,800
Stomach in a bit.

530
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,770
Come, take a small step forward.

531
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,130
Okay.

532
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,400
Relax.

533
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
Can you go further?

534
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,560
Okay.

535
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,330
Keep it up.

536
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,010
Keep your back straight.

537
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,330
-[You're even touching her foot?]
-Breathe in for three seconds.

538
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,170
Breathe out for three seconds.

539
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,530
[I haven't even touched it.]

540
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,730
Breathe in.

541
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,490
Breathe out.

542
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,930
Come, one more time.

543
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,810
Lower your center of gravity even more, come.

544
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,090
I think the ligament on this side

545
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,290
is better than the other side.

546
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,570
Right, good.

547
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,610
You even followed for this, too.

548
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,730
Old man,

549
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,330
this is really not for you.

550
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,690
Why is it not suitable?

551
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,600
I exercise every day, okay?

552
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,770
I see.

553
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,520
I know.

554
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,530
After all, you're free.

555
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,370
Siyu, this is your friend?

556
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,640
No, he came by himself.

557
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,490
Where do you want to exercise today, bro?

558
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,800
I'll take you to exercise later.

559
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,690
There's no need.

560
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,570
I exercise every day.

561
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,770
Coach, look.

562
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,970
People are definitely different from one another.

563
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,650
Your muscles

564
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,080
are really impressive.

565
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,520
It's so-so.

566
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,560
I have a fast metabolism

567
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,930
now.

568
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,520
My metabolism will slow down

569
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,240
when I get older,

570
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,130
and it'll be more difficult for the workout by then.

571
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,770
I see.

572
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,410
It'll be difficult?

573
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,490
Look.

574
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,530
Look at me.

575
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,970
I do bench press.

576
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,090
One hundred and ten kilograms.

577
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,290
One hundred and ten kilograms?

578
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,850
Then you're pretty amazing.

579
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,760
I can only push 100 kilograms at most.

580
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,730
Your friend is cool.

581
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,530
Bro.

582
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,130
You're almost there. Do practice more.

583
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,450
You're so amazing?

584
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,290
Then let's go.

585
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,530
Show us.

586
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,730
There's no need. I can do it myself.

587
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,450
Are you sure you don't need to warm up first?

588
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,170
Lad,

589
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,770
you're too young.

590
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,050
Come on.

591
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,760
I didn't rest well these two days.

592
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,730
I'll do deadlift then.

593
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,970
There'll be no problem with the deadlift.

594
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,250
Come on.

595
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,410
Why don't you work out?

596
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,570
Go ahead, and I'll accompany you.

597
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,650
I...

598
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,480
I'm here, little aunt.

599
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,970
Remember to

600
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,450
talk to the girl nicely.

601
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,010
She's also a doctor.

602
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,760
She can surely get along with you.

603
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,570
By the way, her last name is Yu.

604
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,290
Got it.

605
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,850
Miss Yu?

606
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,930
Mr. Ling?

607
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,560
She's arrived.

608
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,240
Little aunt, I'll hang up first.

609
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,169
Okay.

610
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,770
-Why is it you?
-Why is it you?

611
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,169
Waiter.

612
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,050
Get me another cup of hot Americano.

613
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,210
Okay, wait a moment.

614
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,530
Don't tell me you deliberately came

615
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,050
on a blind date to run into me

616
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,890
just because of

617
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,320
the joke I made the other day?

618
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,330
Then why did you come on a blind date?

619
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,010
Because I'm bored.

620
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,770
Since I'll be treated to a meal,

621
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,370
I'll take the opportunity to come out

622
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,010
and observe

623
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,530
the wonders of the world occasionally.

624
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,290
It's quite interesting.

625
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,410
How about you?

626
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,530
When I'm at home,

627
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,320
I can't always use the ring as an excuse.

628
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,490
I have experience in such a thing.

629
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,360
Thank you.

630
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,770
I have a good way.

631
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,690
First of all, you must pretend

632
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,770
that the two of us

633
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,080
didn't know each other.

634
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,650
So no one

635
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,090
will force us to get along.

636
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,010
Since the introducer is not here,

637
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,130
we two can leave right away

638
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,240
after drinking coffee.

639
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,080
I happen to want to see

640
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,800
today's newly introduced medical equipment.

641
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,570
Speaking of which,

642
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,770
do you want to go together?

643
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,530
Didn't you say that we'll separate after drinking?

644
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,170
That's right, too.

645
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,360
Why would you

646
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,730
be interested in medical equipment?

647
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,650
But there's one more thing.

648
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,090
Both of us have to

649
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,200
say the same thing.

650
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,770
After I go back, I'll say

651
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,080
that you're not to my liking

652
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,720
and that I don't think you're good enough for me.

653
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,000
But it's hard to be convincing

654
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
since you're so excellent.

655
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,010
Let me think again.

656
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,480
Or you can just say

657
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,120
that you're not good enough for me.

658
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,130
Okay, this is good.

659
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,330
It's impossible that I'm not good enough for you.

660
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,490
Then others will definitely think

661
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,330
that you have a unique taste.

662
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,130
All kinds of weirdos

663
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,570
will probably come and harass you.

664
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,690
It's very good.

665
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,610
As long as you think it's good.

666
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,680
Why do you stop, mom?

667
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,410
What are you looking at?

668
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh.

669
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,650
Mom...

670
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,410
Mom will play a game

671
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,010
with you, okay?

672
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,690
Let's play...

673
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,370
You know that woman?

674
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,650
Shall we walk sideways?

675
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,770
It's okay. Let's go.

676
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,170
Looking at your reaction,

677
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,530
I don't think you're okay.

678
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,920
-Youyou.
-Uncle Doll.

679
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,640
Youyou, come down.

680
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,770
Lu Youyou.

681
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,160
Don't tell me she's your ex-wife?

682
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,000
Youyou, come down.

683
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,410
She's really your ex-wife?

684
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,640
Drink coffee.

685
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,440
It's really troublesome.

686
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,960
What is the trouble?

687
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,040
You want to be noticed by her,

688
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,850
and don't want to be noticed by her.

689
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,770
Don't worry about it. Drink coffee.

690
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,890
Don't waste it. Drink it.

691
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,650
What are you doing?

692
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,570
Don't move.

693
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,160
Mom, do you know Uncle Doll?

694
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,010
Why don't you go in?

695
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,960
Because...

696
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Because we're playing

697
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,130
hide-and-seek.

698
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,410
I can't let him see me.

699
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:34,920
Let's go.

700
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,090
Mom brings you to eat ice cream.

701
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,520
Mom, it doesn't match fries.

702
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,610
It doesn't match?

703
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,770
Mom, let me help you.

704
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,770
Lu Youyou.

705
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,000
Listen to me. They're coming.

706
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,370
Dad.

707
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,600
Kid.

708
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,050
You can't simply call a person your dad.

709
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,970
Aunt, do you know my dad?

710
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,010
What is your relationship with him?

711
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,370
I...

712
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,170
Lu Youyou.

713
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,250
Come over.

714
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,370
Come over.

715
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,050
I'm sorry, Ling Rui.

716
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,730
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,250
Mom, what a coincidence.

718
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,050
We ran into dad.

719
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,490
How do you know

720
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,360
that he's your dad?

721
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,530
I...

722
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,570
I'm his father?

723
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,250
Youyou.

724
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,130
Yes.

725
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,450
Your name is Youyou, right?

726
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,120
Yes.

727
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,970
Youyou,

728
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,130
can you

729
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,290
go home first?

730
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:29,930
I have something

731
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,170
to talk to your mother about.

732
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,240
Mom.

733
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,450
You go home first. Be good.

734
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,200
Uncle Doll,

735
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,720
don't bully my mom.

736
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:41,450
Be good.

737
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,440
Go now.

738
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,000
The child has gone back.

739
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,450
We can have a good talk.

740
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,690
Ling Rui.

741
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,810
Lu Fangning.

742
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,400
Tell me seriously,

743
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,250
Youyou is the child of you and me,

744
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,280
right?

745
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,170
How old is he?

746
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,370
Five years old.

747
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,770
That means

748
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,050
six years ago,

749
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,570
you left

750
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,370
the divorce agreement and left me.

751
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,640
Then you found out

752
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,090
that you were pregnant.

753
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,850
Ling Rui, I'm sorry.

754
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,680
-I...
-Lu Fangning.

755
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,200
Why didn't you tell me?

756
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,160
Why did you choose to

757
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,640
raise Youyou alone abroad?

758
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,170
I...

759
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,410
I just didn't want to

760
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,930
disturb your life.

761
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,730
Did you know

762
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,090
what you were doing?

763
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,920
Just now, that was the first time

764
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,530
Youyou called me dad during these six years.

765
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,570
And I thought

766
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,010
that was just a joke.

767
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,330
I'm sorry.

768
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,200
Six years ago,

769
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,720
why did you leave without saying anything?

770
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,170
Do you know that I was

771
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,570
looking for you crazily?

772
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,090
Or

773
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,410
you thought that it was for my sake

774
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,800
to support me

775
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,010
to further my studies at the German Institute,

776
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,890
and that you sacrificed for me?

777
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,170
How did you know that?

778
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,570
Lu Fangning.

779
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,770
You said you didn't want to disturb my life,

780
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,520
but you made the decision for me

781
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,690
without my knowledge.

782
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,440
You...

783
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,610
You still don't understand.
