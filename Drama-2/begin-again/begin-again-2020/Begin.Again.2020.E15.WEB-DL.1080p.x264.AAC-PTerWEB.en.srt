I know he's not as handsome as me.

Who's he?

00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,489
You're being weird today.

Okay.

12
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,220
A friend of mine

What caused her to change?

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,980
Your friend?

22
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,580
My friend.

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,100
Could it be that

24
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,700

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,460
She's hurt?

to send a signal

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,380
to the men.

39
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,300
It means that

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,900

41
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,220
"Be careful."

00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,330
Be careful.

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,260
before I leave you.

48
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,540
What to do then?

49

You know what?

57

When you went on that business trip,

58
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,300
Mr. Yu and I thought

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,940

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,740
So, we told her

61

are shown all over her face.

67
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,940
It's empathy.

68

It's your friend.

79
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,539
I didn't say it was both of you.

80
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,130
I just used you as an example.

81
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,659
Just a friend.

if she cried after she left.

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,380
You know, women are creatures

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,900

93
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,820

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,860
The money will be transferred to your account.

198
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,620
You're back.

199
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,020
Get well soon.

200
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,860
They prepared these.

201
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,740
They got it wrong.

202
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,620
It's okay.

203
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,460
Ling Rui,

204
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,700
what are you doing?

205
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,780
Come here.

206
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,580
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

207
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,970
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

208
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,970
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

209
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,140
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

210
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,980
Do you want to blow out the candles?

211
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,860
Make a wish.

212
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,620
Ling Rui.

213
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,090
Did you prepare all of these by yourself?

214
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,740
I wanted to give you a surprise.

215
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,260
But I don't think it's very successful.

216
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,130
At least the cake is okay.

217
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,690
This is my gift for you.

218
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,900
I hope you like it.

219
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Ling Rui, it just occurred to me

220
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,090
that I have to deal with
an emergency in the office,

221
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,809
I have to... I have to go now.

222
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,580
Thank you.

223
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,059
Fangning!

224
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,450
He's celebrating your birthday.

225
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,410
Lu Fangning, you're so stupid.

226
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,730
A coin?

227
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,300
Amusement park?

228
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,220
Why did he give me a coin
from the amusement park?

229
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,540
Oh, no.

230
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,530
No, no.

231
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,420
Hey, Ling Rui. What's up?

232
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,700
Fangyu,

233
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,380
do you know that

234
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,370
today is Fangning's birthday?

235
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,580
Of course, I do.

236
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,860
Ling Rui.

237
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
You didn't celebrate my sister's birthday,

238
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,260
did you?

239
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,060
Did she hit you?

240
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,170
We can't celebrate

241
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,850
her birthday?

242
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,860
Our eldest sister died

243
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,620
on the day of her birthday.

244
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,940
I was still too young at that time,

245
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,100
I don't quite know

246
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,090
what happened exactly.

247
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,620
Ling Rui,

248
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,260
are you okay?

249
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,540
Are you hurt?

250
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,060
Since our eldest sister passed away,

251
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,420
none of us

252
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,210
has celebrated her birthday.

253
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,060
Even though

254
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,820
she looks fine,

255
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,660
nobody dares to

256
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,250
mess with her on her birthday.

257
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,780
Why are you still...

258
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm fine.

259
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I think

260
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,260
she even thanked me.

261
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,300
What did you say?

262
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,340
She thanked you?

263
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,420
You really are her husband.

264
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,740
She's very tolerant of you.

265
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,890
I have to go now, Fangyu.

266
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,900
Where is it?

267
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
It's so cold.

268
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,090
Fangning, what happened?

269
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,060
What are you looking for?

270
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,980
Well,

271
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,690
the coin.

272
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,930
You dropped the coin?

273
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,620
Stop looking.

274
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,740
No.

275
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,620
You gave it to me, so it's mine now.

276
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,100
I have to find it. Just leave me be.

277
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,370
Stop looking.

278
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,250
Let's go home.

279
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,260
If you insist,

280
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,340
I will carry you home.

281
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,900
Let's go.

282
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,450
Let's go.

283
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,890
It's okay.

284
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,500
Here.

285
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,220
Take the medicine before you go to bed.

286
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,860
Are you going to stay here

287
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,700
and watch me sleep?

288
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,020
I can't sleep when you're watching me.

289
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,090
Why did you

290
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,020
thank me?

291
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,450
Because I know

292
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,140
you did everything

293
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,940
to make me happy.

294
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,450
Do you think

295
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,420
I like acting like a fool

296
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,260
to watch you

297
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,060
ride on the merry-go-round

298
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,700
and play bumper cars with you?

299
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,650
I did all of these

300
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,460
just to make you happy!

301
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,340
Excuse me.

302
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,020
In my eye,

303
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,140
Ling Rui is this amazing.

304
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,500
What can I do

305
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
to make you believe me?

306
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,020
Should I sponsor more patients

307
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,220
for your sake?

308
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,130
The vegetables that you like,

309
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,770
fish, Mapo tofu.

310
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,580
And the soup that I made.

311
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,740
Lu Fangning,

312
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,490
I should thank you, too.

313
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,060
I want…

314
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,290
What do I want?

315
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,140
Get married?

316
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,250
No, wait.

317
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,170
Fall in love, get married…

318
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,050
I think we've messed up the order.

319
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,780
Then let me sort it out from the beginning.

320
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,540
Figure it out step by step.

321
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,700
Ling Rui.

322
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,450
Ling Rui?

323
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,290
Where did he go this early morning?

324
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,020
Ling Rui has been investing?

325
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,060
The profits seem great.

326
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,940
He's quite good at it.

327
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
At this rate,

328
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,380
he will be able to

329
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,900
pay off his debt soon, won't he?

330
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,620
You woke up.

331
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Where were you?

332
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,180
We were out of milk.

333
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,330
So, I went out and bought some.

334
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,650
Are you feeling better now?

335
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,410
I'm fine now.

336
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,530
By the way,

337
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,980
are there any restaurants that you like?

338
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,220
Restaurants that I like?

339
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,460
I mean,

340
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,530
which restaurant

341
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,460
do you usually go to?

342
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,740
[What does he mean?]

343
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,620
[Doesn't he like]

344
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,660
[homemade meals?]

345
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,300
[He doesn't even want to]

346
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,420
[cook for me anymore now?]

347
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,180
Never mind. Let's talk about it another time.

348
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,900
Ling Rui, I need to use the bathroom.

349
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,300
[What does he want to say now?]

350
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,650
I think it would be better for us

351
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,620
to call off the engagement.

352
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,740
I'm willing to bear

353
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,530
all of the consequences.

354
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,980
Right now,

355
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,940
he's trying to refuse me

356
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,340
before I make any moves?

357
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,580
It's over.

358
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,580
Yesterday, I...

359
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,460
Well done.

360
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,220
You even lost the coin

361
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,930
that he gave you.

362
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,220
Lu Fangning,

363
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,940
why don't you

364
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,540
know anything about love?

365
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,140
No.

366
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,580
I can't sit on the problem.

367
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,140
I found it.

368
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,810
Thank you.

369
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,780
You're welcome.

370
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,900
Thank you for helping.

371
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,900
I've finally found you.

372
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,020
I had been looking for you.

373
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,580
I will never

374
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,700
lose you again.

375
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,060
I will...

376
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,570
carry you

377
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,580
with me

378
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,620
all the time.

379
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,540
You're in a good mood.

380
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,780
Fangning and you...

381
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,140
Wait, no. How are things going

382
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,900
for your friend

383
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,780
and his female friend?

384
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,260
They sorted it out.

385
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,610
Everything will start again from the beginning.

386
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,330
Hello, Ms. Lu?

387
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,860
Start again from the beginning?

388
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,050
What does he mean?

389
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,340
Going back

390
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,450
to that time

391
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,660
where we didn't know each other?

392
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,020
Not married.

393
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,530
Not in a relationship.

394
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,220
So he's trying

395
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,380
to get a divorce?

396
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,700
Ling Rui.

397
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,490
I won't let you carry out your plan.

398
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,660
Fangning,

399
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,060
let's have dinner together tonight.

400
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,660
I can't go tonight.

401
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,410
I have to work overtime.

402
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,090
Why is the water drained?

403
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,420
I have no idea either.

404
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,420
Why are you following me?

405
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,740
I have a busy day today.

406
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,780
I can't drive you to work.

407
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,580
See you.

408
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,570
You're not going to drive to work?

409
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,580
I am.

410
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,290
The parking lot is that way.

411
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,860
I left something at home.

412
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,340
I have to go now. See you.

413
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,180
I can wait for you.

414
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,940
There's no need.

415
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,580
You can go ahead. Bye.

416
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,300
I'm starving.

417
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,380
Fangning.

418
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,300
It's almost lunchtime.

419
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,300
Let's have lunch together.

420
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,860
No, thank you.

421
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
What about dinner then?

422
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,810
I don't want to have dinner. I'm on a diet.

423
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,740
Diet?

424
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,820
I'm not hungry.

425
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,140
Fangning!

426
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm not hungry!

427
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,360
[Deer Sing Group]

428
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,300
Please give me the list.

429
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,420
Okay.

430
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,150
Director Lu, here is the list.

431
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,700
Thank you.

432
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,300
Morning, Siyu.

433
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,100
Don't blame me.

434
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,770
I didn't mean to

435
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,700
ignore you just now.

436
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,090
Actually, I meant it.

437
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,700
But it's not that

438
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
I didn't want to talk to you.

439
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
I just…

440
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,650
I know.

441
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,850
We should keep our relationship
a secret in the office.

442
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,660
It's better for you.

443
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,650
What about after work?

444
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,580
Sorry?

445
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,650
Are we still

446
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,180
going on a date after work?

447
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,940
Where do you want to go?

448
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,460
Anywhere you like...

449
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,580
Director Lu.

450
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,100
Hey.

451
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,460
You don't have to act like this.

452
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm your director.

453
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,810
It's normal for you to talk to me.

454
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,100
Right, I can talk to you.

455
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,020
Hi.

456
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,899
Hi, Andy.

457
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,899
Hi, Siyu.

458
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:35,410
Hi, Liu.

459
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,460
Come in.

460
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,010
Director Lu, I need you to sign these files.

461
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,090
Sure.

462
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,580
Remember to have lunch.

463
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,730
Remember to drink water.

464
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,210
See you in the parking lot after work.

465
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,420
Love you.

466
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,180
Please sign here.

467
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,060
I've signed it.

468
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,340
Thank you.

469
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,940
Director.

470
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,620
What should we do? Lock it!

471
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,180
Do you have a safe?

472
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,820
Trash bin?

473
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,170
Wait, wait.

474
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,940
Calm down.

475
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,490
Just act normal.

476
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,770
Stand up straight.

477
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,460
Come in.

478
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I'm here for Director Lu's signature.

479
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,580
I saw that.

480
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,930
Why did you have to tell me?

481
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,580
What's the matter?

482
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,260
It's about

483
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,220
the condition brought up

484
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,900
by Bai Jing.

485
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,580
What are you doing?

486
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,220
Did you twist your ankle?

487
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,100
No, my shoe got dirty.

488
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,650
Your sticker fell off.

489
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,050
It's just a sticker.

490
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,290
You acted like

491
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,620
it was a love letter.

492
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,220
I should go now.

493
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,900
Sorry for interrupting.

494
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,450
Are you all right, Siyu?

495
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,370
See you, Siyu.

496
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,020
Ling Rui,

497
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,700
why... why are you here?

498
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,050
I'm waiting for you to finish your work

499
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,020
so we can have dinner together.

500
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,610
I already got an appointment tonight.

501
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,900
But...

502
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,740
your secretary told me

503
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,700
you don't have
any other appointments today.

504
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,450
She knows nothing…

505
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,140
I have an appointment with my job.

506
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,770
I have a date with my work.

507
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,940
I have a lot to do.

508
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,540
Why don't you...

509
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,460
You can just go…

510
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,260
It's all right. Take your time.

511
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,660
I'll wait for you.

512
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,500
Why are you still acting sneaky?

513
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,250
I told you it's fine now.

514
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,220
I got used to it.

515
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,940
Besides, if our colleagues

516
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,940
found out about our relationship,

517
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,740
wouldn't it be bad for you?

518
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,300
Siyu,

519
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,850
you really are a good girl.

520
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,540
I think so, too.

521
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,810
Director Lu, did you just like me

522
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,780
a little more just now?

523
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,930
Where are we going next?

524
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,730
Have dinner and watch a movie.

525
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,460
That's boring.

526
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,410
Let me take you to a place.

527
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,500
You'll definitely like it.

528
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,690
Sure.

529
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,300
Buckle up.

530
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,610
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

531
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,180
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

532
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,580
Pet shops? Why did you bring me here?

533
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,770
To commemorate the moment

534
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,380
when you made my heart skipped.

535
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:42,420
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

536
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,980
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

537
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,700
♫ I like you ♫

538
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,450
♫ Only you ♫

539
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,180
♫ You're my one and only ♫

540
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:05,900
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

541
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,700
He's not going to wait here forever, is he?

542
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,100
Is he not leaving

543
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,580
until he achieves his goal?

544
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,740
You're done?

545
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,410
Let's go.

546
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,420
I...

547
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,340
I haven't.

548
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,100
I need to use the bathroom.

549
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,700
Okay.
