since the management team of Lu Ming has changed,

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,550
This was such an outdated

194
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,590
excuse.

195
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,390
Now that I've grown up,

196
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,510
this can no longer satisfy me.

197
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,310
Please give my dad's face

198
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,310
back to me right away.

199
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,750
You want a face, right?

200
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,640
Okay, then whose face you want?

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,910
Spider-man or batman?

202
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,260
I'll change it for you tomorrow.

203
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,270
How can you say that?

204
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,030
He'll be sad later.

205
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,150
Don't be fooled by him.

206
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,780
This kid is smarter than me.

207
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,830
Lu Youyou, we'll go back tomorrow.

208
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,820
Go back immediately.

209
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,150
You're still acting?

210
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,230
Don't pretend anymore.

211
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,990
No pouting. Stop acting so.

212
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,230
Mom.

213
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,190
Mom.

214
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,630
Mom.

215
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,990
Look,

216
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,030
you're making the kid sad.

217
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,360
He's sad?

218
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,070
Little grandpa,

219
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,790
I'm not sad. I'm making trouble instead.

220
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,270
Mom is most afraid of Youyou

221
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,070
crying and yelling.

222
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,500
-Mom.
-Listen.

223
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,910
-Is this what a kid should say?
-Mom.

224
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,390
Mom.

225
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,180
Mom.

226
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,110
Lu Youyou, don't make trouble again.

227
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,550
Don't you want to stay here anymore?

228
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,550
Come.

229
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,190
Welcome back home.

230
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,990
I can only stay for a while.

231
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,070
Youyou is asleep.

232
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,790
He's sleeping like a pig.

233
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,000
Fine.

234
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,110
He feels at ease seeing you.

235
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,990
I'm afraid that it'd be inconvenient

236
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,950
for you to stay in a hotel bringing Youyou along.

237
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,550
So I simply did the cleaning

238
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,670
for you.

239
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
I can see it.

240
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,790
Thank you, little uncle.

241
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,990
But I really can only stay for a while.

242
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,150
What exactly happened?

243
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,790
Why did Youyou come back suddenly?

244
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,110
Don't mention it.

245
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,710
Shen Zhuo.

246
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,790
He's always wanted

247
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,590
to come back to China for his career.

248
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,350
So he's holding a White Queen exhibition

249
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,510
with Shenzhen-Hong Kong University,

250
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,440
but then he broke his hand.

251
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,590
So he couldn't work alone

252
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,590
and wanted to deceive me to come back.

253
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,470
But I definitely wouldn't want to come back.

254
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,920
In the end, he went to deceive Youyou.

255
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,830
He told Youyou that

256
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,710
he could find his dad when he's back in China.

257
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,590
Youyou would definitely want to come back after hearing that.

258
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,710
As a result,

259
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,070
I'm back here, too.

260
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,750
So

261
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,150
what is your plan?

262
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,200
Staying here?

263
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,430
I'm definitely leaving.

264
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,710
But now that I've returned home,

265
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,790
I'll only decide

266
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,100
after getting the work done here.

267
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,430
Do you want to tell Ling...

268
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,510
He...

269
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,350
He should also have the right to know.

270
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,520
I...

271
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,710
Look, you left without saying anything

272
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,860
six years ago.

273
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,870
My brother also didn't tell me

274
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,990
where you went.

275
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,510
When I contacted you again,

276
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,430
a little grandson

277
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,630
appeared out of nowhere.

278
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,630
I really

279
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,870
couldn't accept it at that time.

280
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,830
Not to mention

281
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,140
the one who is staring at me.

282
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,870
Simon.

283
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,560
It's really

284
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,150
very difficult for me.

285
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,950
You always say this

286
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,870
whenever I ask you about this.

287
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,060
-The first year.
-The first year.

288
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,350
The first year.

289
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,230
Hello.

290
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,310
I've received it. I'm looking at it now.

291
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,140
Be obedient.

292
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,470
Mom is making money for your milk powder.

293
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,430
At that time, we just divorced.

294
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,790
How could I disturb him?

295
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,920
Ling Rui just started his studies

296
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,830
in Germany.

297
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,070
He must be very busy.

298
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,630
How could I distract him?

299
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,310
The milk is here.

300
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,590
After that...

301
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,550
I was a mess,

302
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,150
and that was a huge difference from before.

303
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,590
I couldn't go to see Ling Rui.

304
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,030
He'd definitely find me embarrassing.

305
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,910
What if he also disliked Youyou?

306
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,710
Youyou,

307
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,280
come and have your meal.

308
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,640
It's so delicious.

309
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,190
Let's eat something delicious.

310
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,910
Youyou was at the age

311
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,550
when people hate the most.

312
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,350
Ling Rui would blame me,

313
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,430
saying that I didn't take good care of the kid.

314
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,550
My new career had just started,

315
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,680
and I had to take care of Youyou.

316
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,550
I was too busy.

317
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,200
How could I have the energy to care about others?

318
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,550
What are you doing?

319
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,470
These few years have passed.

320
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,110
I must be courting death

321
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,390
to tell him about this at the moment.

322
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,070
I'll tell him

323
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,270
when Lu Youyou has grown up.

324
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,670
What about now?

325
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,510
What excuse are you making?

326
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,940
Uncle.

327
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,720
You don't know

328
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,830
that I'm a coward.

329
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,310
I once thought

330
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,830
that it was a little lie,

331
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,670
but it has now become

332
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,190
a big lie.

333
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,150
How do I tell him?

334
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,990
How do I speak?

335
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,590
How should I tell him?

336
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,030
Moreover, have you ever thought

337
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,070
about what I should do

338
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,110
if he's living a good

339
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,910
and happy life now?

340
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,230
He's forgotten me.

341
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,270
How is he going to face this

342
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,990
if I bring a son to go and see him?

343
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,990
Moreover,

344
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,390
have you ever thought

345
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,190
about what would happen to me

346
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,230
if he got to know this?

347
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,790
Then how long

348
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,710
are you going to keep it to yourself?

349
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,870
Simon.

350
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,270
It's like this.

351
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,510
It's been six years.

352
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,070
I don't care

353
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,110
to wait a little longer.

354
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,910
I'll definitely think of a solution

355
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,590
as soon as possible.

356
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,630
But currently,

357
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,870
the first task

358
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,550
is to settle my work

359
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,470
in China

360
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,750
as soon as possible.

361
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm meeting

362
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,710
a curatorial company later on.

363
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,910
I'll go and talk to them.

364
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,190
But before I make a move,

365
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,230
I still have to tell you

366
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,190
that please make sure

367
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,070
that you don't tell anyone.

368
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,310
Don't tell him.

369
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,430
You must keep it as a secret for me,

370
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,030
particularly before

371
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,670
I tell him.

372
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,670
Also, don't tell others

373
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,150
that I've returned to China.

374
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,150
But no one will know, too.

375
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,350
Fangning?

376
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,990
Uncle Tang.

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,790
You kid.

378
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,590
Why didn't you tell me

379
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,990
that you're back?

380
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,870
Do you know how worried I was?

381
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,750
A few years ago,

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,830
you sold the shares and left.

383
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,070
A few days later,

384
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,990
your father left LM Deer Sing Group, too.

385
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,350
It made me feel

386
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,030
uncomfortable for a long time.

387
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,150
I thought

388
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,070
that your family's business would be gone.

389
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,550
Perhaps I wouldn't want to live anymore.

390
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,430
I didn't expect to see you again.

[White Queen]

392
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,510
This White...

393
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,350
White Queen.

394
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,350
It's unimportant.

395
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,550
White Queen.

396
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,560
You conducted research

397
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,110
[Our Vision]

398
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,670
and developed this brand on your own?

399
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,750
I'm managing this,

400
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,670
and others are in charge of the design.

401
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,050
[Active Giant Star]

402
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,350
Good.

403
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,350
Good.

404
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,910
Although I haven't heard of it,

405
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,870
I believe

406
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,470
that you'll succeed.

407
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,310
In fact, it's considered a success

408
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,550
overseas.

409
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,670
It's quite famous abroad.

410
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,350
Nothing.

411
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,350
Uncle Tang,

412
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,430
I'm back this time

413
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,710
just to settle some work.

414
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,630
Okay.

415
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,230
I'll leave when I'm done.

416
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,990
So fast?

417
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,070
So

418
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,390
don't tell Tang Ping.

419
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,160
Why?

420
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,430
Why don't we tell Pingping?

421
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,270
What is it that you don't want to tell me?

422
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,710
Pingping. This...

423
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,830
Lu Fangning?

424
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,670
You're back?

425
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,230
Hello, Lu Fangning is back.

426
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,790
Who are you calling?

427
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,910
Cai Siyu.

428
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,950
She's introducing me to a role.

429
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,390
The most beautiful woman in the drama.

430
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,750
You've finally come back.

431
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,630
I missed you so much.

432
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,309
Long time no see.

433
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,510
I don't usually

434
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,630
come to

435
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,670
this kind of public area.

436
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,150
It's not that good to cause a commotion after all.

437
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,110
I'd thought of offering help

438
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,750
before someone left,

439
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,230
and I'm more capable of helping now.

440
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,470
But

441
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,710
don't ask how I can help.

442
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,430
I'm afraid that someone won't be able to stand it.

443
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,230
Wasn't someone

444
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,710
into romance fiction before?

445
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,790
Those she used to see

446
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,270
are all rubbish.

447
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,110
The one who is top-notch in this industry

448
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,830
is sitting here right now.

449
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,470
But someone doesn't have to be afraid.

450
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,390
Even if she has no money,

451
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,870
we won't give her the cold shoulder.

452
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,910
-Right, Ms. Cai?
-Of course.

453
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,910
Even though she's

454
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,150
not my boss anymore,

455
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,020
we're still friends.

456
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,750
Artiste Tang.

457
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,150
Yes, friends.

458
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,870
Correct.

459
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,190
Won't dislike me?

460
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,840
We're still friends?

461
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,550
Pingping,

462
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,470
I won't dislike you either.

463
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,230
After all, I only saw

464
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,510
your gossip news

465
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,390
when they popped up

466
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,430
occasionally.

467
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,510
I heard that you went to shoot a drama.

468
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,710
I also took a look.

469
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,180
You played the assistant

470
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,270
of a female supporting character.

471
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,630
I didn't see your name

472
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,630
at the subtitles appeared at the end

473
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,060
even when the song is over.

474
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,910
If you really want to act,

475
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,910
I still have

476
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,150
some resources

477
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,950
although I was not in China.

478
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,750
I can help you introduce

479
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,790
to shoot a few dramas.

480
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,830
Why are you laughing?

481
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,990
Top-notch in the industry?

482
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,270
What era is it now?

483
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,230
You're still writing this kind of tacky plot.

484
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,030
Do you have any common sense?

485
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,910
What else can happen

486
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,750
when they're drunk?

487
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,470
Nothing.

488
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,470
Ms. Lu, I was wrong.

489
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,830
Fangning, help me.

490
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,030
Help me.

491
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,460
Ms. Lu,

492
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,950
don't tell me that you actually

493
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,030
read the novel which made my name?

494
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,350
When I was bored overseas, I'd have a look.

495
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,630
Then you really watched my drama?

496
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,430
Abroad?

497
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,350
It's okay.

498
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,200
You usually

499
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,550
watch international news to make money.

500
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,110
Now you've watched romance dramas for me.

501
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,230
That means

502
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,270
I'm as important as

503
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,070
your career of making money?

504
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,110
-Love you, Ms. Lu.
-Love you.

505
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,440
Love you.

506
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,670
It's pretty good

507
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,150
to see

508
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,030
that you two are having quite a good time.

509
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,990
Ms. Lu.

510
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,230
How about you?

511
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,710
Why did you

512
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,030
leave without saying anything?

513
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,830
Why didn't you get in touch with us

514
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,420
in six years?

515
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,350
Yes, indeed.

516
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,190
Didn't you merely lose a company?

517
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,910
Anyone will have experienced it.

518
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,230
You didn't have to hide from us,

519
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,310
and for so long.

520
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,430
It's long enough

521
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,300
to have kids.

522
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,550
What?

523
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,430
What did you say?

524
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,390
Ms. Lu.

525
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,470
You left without saying anything at that time.

526
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,630
Later on, we learned

527
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,630
that you even divorced.

528
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,420
Why did you divorce Dr. Ling?

529
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,870
Was it really like what he said

530
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,830
that you two had a personality clash?

531
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
We...

532
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,030
It must be Dr. Ling's fault.

533
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,750
Lu Fangning is so great.

534
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,750
Forget it, don't ask.

535
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,870
Six years have passed.

536
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,820
Dr. Ling has even...

537
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,550
Even...

538
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,510
What is it?

539
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,430
Forget it.

540
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,870
Why do you still mention him?

541
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,670
Dr. Ling has even...

542
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,600
What happened?

543
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,740
Even...

544
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,750
Forget it.

545
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,150
Don't say anymore.

546
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,910
Shut up.

547
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,270
Okay.

548
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,430
In fact, this time around, I didn't tell anyone

549
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,430
that I've come back.

550
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,030
I also hope that you two

551
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,990
can keep it a secret for me.

552
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,390
Don't tell anyone.

553
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,710
Don't tell...

554
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,110
Don't tell Dr. Ling particularly.

555
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,350
I know.

556
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,750
We won't tell him for sure.

557
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,470
Don't worry.

558
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,420
Okay, I'm leaving.

559
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,630
Won't you stay a little longer?

560
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,390
I... I still have something to do.

561
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,710
I still have something to do.

562
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,030
Then are we seeing each other next time?

563
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,310
You let go of my hand first.

564
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,310
Sure.

565
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,750
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

566
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,670
When can I see her next time?

567
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,430
I didn't expect that seeing Lu Fangning

568
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,590
would make me so happy.

569
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll take a picture to celebrate.

["An Escape from the Boss"] [By Cai Siyu]

with the accumulation of experience.

762
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,810
This student,

763
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,050
do you have any questions?

764
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,410
Professor Ling,

765
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,250
I checked the information before.

766
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,560
For LPD surgery,

767
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,970
the mortality rate of the patient

768
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,810
in the next 90 days

769
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,250
is up to ten percent.

770
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,810
But for an ordinary open surgery,

771
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,450
the mortality rate is only two percent.

772
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,330
Since there's such a high mortality rate,

773
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,690
is it necessary for us

774
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,210
to develop this kind of technique?

775
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,890
This student is very serious.

776
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,690
But if you

777
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,430
had checked the information carefully,

778
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,890
you'd discover

779
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,730
that in different centers in the past,

780
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,250
for the postoperative research review

781
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:55,850
of the 1,029 cases

782
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,410
of laparoscopic

783
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,450
pancreaticoduodenectomy,

784
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,930
this data

785
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,010
was modified to

786
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,650
5.93 percent.

787
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,330
After more careful research,

788
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,090
it was discovered that the difference in mortality rate is very big

789
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,920
for different institutions

790
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,290
and different doctors.

791
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,840
In other words,

792
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,750
an experienced doctor

793
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,330
is able to ensure the safety of conducting the surgery.

794
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,530
Professor Ling,

795
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,330
how many times have you performed

796
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,410
such a surgery?

797
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,360
89 cases.

798
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,240
Then the mortality in your hands...?

799
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,290
Two cases.

800
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,760
It was because of postoperative complications.

801
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,970
I know that most of you here

802
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,370
are classmates.

803
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:43,970
You'll possibly become a doctor

804
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,010
in the future.

805
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,720
Throughout your

806
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,360
career,

807
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,610
you may be

808
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,880
asked the same question repeatedly.

809
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,560
A question that

810
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,010
the family members of the patients would ask.

811
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,130
That is

812
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,770
why we can save

813
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,280
another patient with the same condition,

814
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,050
but not their loved ones.

815
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,370
If I ask you,

816
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,330
how will you answer?

817
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,490
You'll slowly realize

818
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,120
that medicine has its limits.

819
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,330
No matter how modern medicine develops,

820
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,050
doctors can't do anything about

821
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,410
birth, old age, sickness, and death.

822
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,050
It's like a gardener who can't do anything to

823
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,930
spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

824
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,050
What a gardener can do

825
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,930
is to just make this flower

826
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,250
bloom more gorgeously

827
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,810
and longer.

828
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,330
But the flower will eventually wither.

829
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,480
This is the law of nature.

830
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,210
If we give up the whole garden

831
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,010
just because of the withering of a flower,

832
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,170
then the boundary of medicine

833
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,890
will appear here.

834
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,770
Appear at the moment.

835
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,520
Appear in front of you and me.

836
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,800
We can only regard all of this

837
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,010
as a process.

838
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,770
Regard the process of seeking an answer

839
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,250
as the answer to this question.

840
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,400
When we continue exploring

841
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,050
and inquiring,

842
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,530
the boundary will continue

843
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,850
move forward

844
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,010
throughout our research

845
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,210
and process of verifying.

846
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,210
Then the things with limitations

847
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,890
will also be filled with hope.

848
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,050
Medicine with a boundary

849
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,570
will also have a considerable future.

850
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,260
He's really handsome.

851
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,730
Yes, indeed.

852
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
He's really handsome. Is he here?

853
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,930
I saw him once last time.

854
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,140
-He's really handsome.
-Yes!

855
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,690
Does he have a girlfriend?

856
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,240
I don't know.

857
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,410
Maybe no.

858
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,200
I remember that there seemed to be one last time.

859
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,330
Really? His ex-girlfriend?

860
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,650
Do you know who his ex-girlfriend is?

861
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,930
I don't know.

862
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,530
She seems to be from this school.

863
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,600
What a pity.

864
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,770
Miss Lu.

865
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,890
Ling Rui.

866
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,089
Professor.

867
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,530
Professor Ling, do you have a girlfriend?

868
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,800
What?

869
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,780
[Lecture on General Foreign Medicine] [Speaker: Ling Rui]

870
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,290
Why didn't they even attach a photo?

871
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,770
This student.

872
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,400
You can't tear the poster.

873
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,050
Leave it to me, bro.

874
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,920
Look. We're...

875
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,570
Are you okay?

876
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,890
I'm sorry.

877
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,520
Thank you for your hard work today.

878
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,810
Student, which faculty are you in?

879
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,180
What do you mean?

880
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,900
It was very wonderful.

881
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,480
Thank you.

882
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,320
It was also very interesting.

883
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,430
♫ This is my first time wanting to see you, but I endured until dawn ♫

884
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,940
♫ This is my second time wanting to see you, but I controlled my emotion ♫

885
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,880
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

886
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,610
I'll do it.

887
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,090
Look.

888
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,570
It's nothing.

889
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,170
Are you okay?

890
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:06,890
Student.

891
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,330
I'm sorry.

892
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,170
You... Your food...

893
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,130
-You can't eat it anymore.
-It's okay.

894
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,450
I...

895
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,730
I'm so sorry.

896
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,650
You...

897
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,770
You go and buy another one.

898
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,480
And a bubble milk tea.

899
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,410
Buy a bubble milk tea.

900
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,770
And also buy a cake.

901
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,650
I'm not a student. I'm a sister.

902
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,530
A large hot Americano.

903
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,850
Okay, just a second.

904
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,160
You can redeem

905
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
an extra-large coffee

906
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,730
if you choose another item

907
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,770
above ten yuan.

908
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,920
Do you need one?

909
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,210
You can also buy one

910
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,890
medium fries

911
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,010
so that you can redeem

912
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,370
an extra-large coffee.

913
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,610
Of course, you can also buy one

914
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,330
large fries

915
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,010
because with this,

916
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,600
you can

917
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,520
collect two stamps at once.

918
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,890
With another two stamps,

919
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,690
you can be entitled to

920
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,730
an upgrade for free again next time.

921
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,450
It won't matter if you have coffee or fries.

922
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,480
Medium or large fries?

923
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,680
Do you need it, Miss?

924
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,930
Why is it so troublesome?

925
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,210
Forget it. I don't want it at all.

926
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,890
What about your large coffee?

927
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:30,770
I don't want it either.

928
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,490
Hello.

929
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,450
Two large hot Americano.

930
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,130
I don't need the rest. Thank you.

931
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
Okay, just a second.

932
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,810
A medium fries

933
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,050
with 100g cost 11 yuan.

934
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,610
The large one with 110g

935
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,520
cost 13 yuan.

936
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,370
Counting like this,

937
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,240
the medium portion

938
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,770
costs 0.11 yuan per gram,

939
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,640
while the large portion

940
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,850
costs 0.1181 yuan per gram.

941
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,640
Then it must be more cost-effective to buy medium fries.

942
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,080
But you can earn points if you buy a large fries.

943
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,330
Don't calculate anymore.

944
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,490
It's unclear.

945
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,040
Why is this world

946
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
so troublesome?

947
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,810
What is the point

948
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,010
of having so many useless promotions?

949
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,770
You still insisted to calculate when you think it's troublesome.

950
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,090
I don't know if you're lazy

951
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,770
or too serious.

952
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,290
You have a new trick.

953
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,880
It's indeed a good way to prevent other girls from pursuing you.

954
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,970
What do you know?

955
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,040
This method is more efficient.

956
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,970
Give it to me.

957
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,970
Why bother?

958
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,920
Since I'm back now,

959
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,450
why not let me help you?

960
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,600
It's completed in one step.

961
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,090
I thought you came back

962
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,410
to look for a job.

963
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,840
It won't cause delays, and there's no contradiction.

964
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,490
After all,

965
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,320
we'd been a campus couple

966
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,330
for five years.

967
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,490
We were a rumored campus couple.

968
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,610
Then we're now

969
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,130
new hospital colleagues.

970
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,690
What do you think?

971
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,450
Do you want me to help you

972
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,050
to appease

973
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,770
the agonizing pain caused by your ex-wife?

974
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,530
Why was there a coincidence?

975
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,130
Why was there a coincidence?

976
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,010
How come we bumped into each other so soon?

977
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:36,890
Why?

978
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,650
Why is he still so good-looking

979
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,840
when six years have passed?

980
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,690
Why I just...

981
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,890
I look quite okay, too.

982
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,520
Today, I...

983
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,370
I was still okay today?

984
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,770
Did he see me?

985
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
He saw me

986
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,690
but he pretended that he didn't?

987
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,850
He ignored me?

988
00:39:59,170 --> 00:39:59,960
That's right, too.

989
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,370
What do you want him to do?

990
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,050
To come and greet you and shake hands,

991
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,280
saying that we haven't been seeing each other for long?

992
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,440
Come to think about it.

993
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,130
You left without saying anything

994
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,360
six years ago.

995
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:08,850
If I were him,

996
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,690
I'd hate me to death.

997
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,320
"I hate you."

998
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,690
"I won't forgive you until the day I die."

999
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,170
Fine.

1000
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,850
In this case,

1001
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,090
I'll let him hate me forever.

1002
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,010
We'll sever our ties for good.

1003
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:33,930
Fangning.

1004
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,610
It's impossible.

1005
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,170
How could Ling Rui be

1006
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,610
such a dramatic person?

1007
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,570
Our Ling Rui

1008
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,490
is a person who is like an angel.

1009
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,080
Long time no see.

1010
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,050
Long time no see.

1011
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,770
Yes, that's just it.

1012
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,050
If he smiles at you,

1013
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,050
you'll just smile back.

1014
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,410
If he ignores you,

1015
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,440
then you'll do the same as well.

1016
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,250
That's right.

1017
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,850
If he talks to you properly,

1018
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,850
you two will just reconcile.

1019
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,490
Isn't it just a meeting?

1020
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,370
Lu Fangning.

1021
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,770
Don't be a coward.

1022
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,160
Don't be a coward.

1023
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,610
It was just an accident today.

1024
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,290
I'm probably not going to

1025
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,650
meet you again tomorrow.

1026
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,490
It's time to give you a bath.

1027
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,250
Come on.

1028
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:38,250
Youyou.

1029
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,280
Put on your shoes.

1030
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,010
-Go.
-Okay.

1031
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,610
Can you wear it?

1032
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,330
Are you sure?

1033
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,250
The shoelaces.

1034
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,290
Look.

1035
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,690
I've taught you so many times,

1036
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,970
but you still don't know how to tie.

1037
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,370
I'm only five years old.

1038
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,330
I already know how to cook, clean,

1039
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,930
sleep alone, and fold the blanket.

1040
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,650
These are only shoelaces.

1041
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,770
Mom,

1042
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,490
don't request

1043
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,530
too much from me.

1044
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,210
I think that except sleeping alone,

1045
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,810
you don't know anything else that you said.

1046
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,370
You're bragging.

1047
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,450
You're bragging.

1048
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,170
It's you.

1049
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,770
That's enough. Mom has to work today.

1050
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,690
I'll fetch you to

1051
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,890
little grandpa's house later.

1052
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,840
You must be obedient

1053
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,970
while you're in grandpa's house.

1054
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:34,810
Got it?

1055
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,330
It's strange.

1056
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,010
Isn't today the weekend?

1057
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,250
Why do you still have to work?

1058
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,410
I can only work on the weekends,

1059
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,250
do you know?

1060
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,800
But then little grandpa's house

1061
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,610
looks

1062
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,880
very boring.

1063
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,010
How come?

1064
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,930
Little grandpa

1065
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,370
is an urban elite.

1066
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,210
The news said that

1067
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,840
over 70 percent of urban elites

1068
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,250
have no energy or interest

1069
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,930
to enjoy their spare time.

1070
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,690
You should

1071
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,810
watch less news.

1072
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,490
Let's go.

1073
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,450
Let's go.

1074
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,250
Who is it?

1075
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,490
Little grandpa,

1076
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,330
mom said that she'll work today,

1077
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,250
so she asked me to come to your house to have fun.

1078
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,570
There's one

1079
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,170
little chameleon.

1080
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,250
Today is the weekend.

1081
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,330
I guess a visiting professor

1082
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,250
won't come either.

1083
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,650
I think it's very simple

1084
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,210
after you've explained.

1085
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,810
You can apply this...

1086
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:14,520
Thank you, teacher.

1087
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,050
Apply this here.

1088
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:16,690
Correct.

1089
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:17,610
This step.

1090
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,530
Ling...

1091
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,050
This step is like this.

1092
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,210
This question can even be solved like this?
