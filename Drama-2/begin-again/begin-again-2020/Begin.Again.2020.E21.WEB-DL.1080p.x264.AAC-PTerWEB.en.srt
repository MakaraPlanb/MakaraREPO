[Episode 21]

4
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
There's still no one.

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,110
Be patient and wait.

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Why is there still no one?

7
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,640
Tang Pingping,

8
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
can you be more natural?

9
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,029
Be quiet.

10
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,680
Don't be like a thief.

11
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,080
No matter what happens

12
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,320
later on,

13
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,320
you must take him

14
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
to the designated location I told you.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Okay.

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
I scared you again.

18
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
It's okay.

19
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm sorry that

20
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,630
I embarrassed you today.

21
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,600
You aren't angry, are you?

22
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,920
Why would I?

23
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Didn't I say that

24
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,680
we'll meet again?

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Don't worry.

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm still your big fan.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,920
That's good then.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
By the way,

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,279
these are for you to eat.

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,920
Do you like them?

31
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,240
For me?

32
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,440
Yes.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,640
Thank you!

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,200
Aiyah.

35
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,920
Aiyo.

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,920
What are you doing?

37
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,600
I...

38
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,120
It hurts.

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
You took candid shots!

40
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,200
Pervert!

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,520
What can a few photos indicate?

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,230
I did nothing.

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
You did nothing?

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you see it?

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
The CCTV is there.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,160
The police will tell you

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,200
whether you did it or not.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm in the wrong.

49
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
It's my first time.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
Please let me off the hook.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,240
Right now,

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,400
you should be thankful

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,480
as you can be corrected

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,760
before making a huge mistake.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm still a student.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
If I'm caught by police,

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,390
my life is over.

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
My future is gone.

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
This society always welcomes

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,390
the one who has turned over a new leaf.

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,960
It hurts.

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,800
Not bad.

63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,400
Aren't you just

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
going to show others

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,440
by dressing like this?

66
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,360
You finally said this.

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,039
It's a modern era now.

68
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,039
You still said something like this.

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,990
Let me tell you.

70
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,800
Wearing a skirt

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,719
is for my own happiness,

72
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,040
but not for others to see.

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,320
How is it?

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,680
Well said.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,960
You praised me?

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Lu Fangning,

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
praise me again.

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
What you just said

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,800
was taught by me.

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
So you know what?

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,160
Your greatest strength

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,670
is that you know to learn from me.

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
I don't need to learn from you.

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Then you use your own words

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,000
to scold him again.

86
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,040
Scold him.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,640
I need to see

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,359
whether he's willing to be scolded by me.

89
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,480
Stop there!

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,280
Who are you again?

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,840
Don't move.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,320
Dr. Ling.

93
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,160
Ling Rui?

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you all right?

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm fine.

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,760
Hit.

97
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
What are you doing?

98
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,080
Hold on.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,040
Hit now.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,800
Hit.

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,960
You pervert!

102
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm beating you to death.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,070
Pervert!

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,040
Scumbag!

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
Vile pervert!

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm beating you to death.

107
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,320
Here you are.

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,840
Drop dead!

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,760
Pervert.

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
Drop dead!

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
Pervert!

112
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Make sure you hit on him.

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,190
I'm hitting you to death.

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm hitting you to death.

115
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,720
Scumbag!

116
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,240
-Drop dead!
-Help!

117
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,320
We finally caught that pervert red-handed.

118
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,359
Lu Fangning.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
You're so smart.

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,720
He really is a habitual offender.

121
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,030
Darling.

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,080
You were so impressive just now.

123
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,230
That was because I heard before that...

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Forget it.

125
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,760
I got it wrong.

126
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,840
It's great that you're fine.

127
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Why would I be hurt?

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,390
But if

129
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,080
something happens to you,

130
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,360
I'll be worried to death.

131
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
You don't even know that

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,960
the hands of a surgeon

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,040
are very precious.

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I used feet just now.

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Yes, you're so smart and amazing!

136
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,160
Lu Fangning,

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,310
why are you so pretentious now?

138
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,000
You can surely

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,680
beat him just now.

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,800
Honey,

141
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,520
you said before that

142
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,040
you could handle it.

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
Did you refer to this?

144
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,960
For this matter,

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
I can do it for you.

146
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,670
Okay.

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
I still have to go to the medical room.

148
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,359
There's still something to deal with.

149
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
We're going to separate again.

150
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,910
What should I do?

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,120
I'll miss you.

152
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
We'll see each other later.

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
Come back early then.

154
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,720
I'll make a move now.

155
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,720
See you tonight.

156
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,990
Missing you!

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,510
Lu Fangning.

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
You've changed.

159
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm better than who I was before.

160
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,800
Why are you following me?

161
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,560
I'm scared of being alone.

162
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,640
Then go home and look for your dad.

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
I won't.

164
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,320
Lu Fangning.

165
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,590
Go to the bar with me tonight.

166
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,720
No, I don't want to.

167
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Do keep me company.

168
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
It shouldn't be a big problem.

169
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,440
But it'd be better for you

170
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,560
to go to a big hospital to check tomorrow.

171
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,800
Try not to move with the wound

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
tonight.

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,920
You're welcome.

175
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,160
Dr. Ling,

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
we took you so long for this.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,680
We're really sorry.

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,320
You haven't eaten yet, right?

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll go and make the arrangement.

180
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,400
There's no need.

181
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,359
I...

182
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,840
My wife is still waiting for me.

183
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
I understand.

184
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,440
Well,

185
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
thank you then.

186
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,360
We'll make a move first.

187
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,920
Okay.

188
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,730
Thank you.

189
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,710
-Thank you, Dr. Ling. Thank you.
-Okay.

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,280
Thank you.

191
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,000
Remember not to move with the wound.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,640
Okay.

193
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,440
Slow down.

194
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,360
Tang Ping.

195
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,000
Tang Pingping.

196
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,160
Tang Ping.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,350
Tang Ping.

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,880
Tang Pingping.

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,000
You've fallen asleep?

200
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,720
You...

201
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,040
What are you doing?

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,160
What's wrong with her?

203
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,400
She was scared today,

204
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
so perhaps she's feeling sad.

205
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,920
But she can even be drunk like this

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
by drinking this wine.

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,720
She really can't drink.

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,320
Tang Ping.

209
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,360
Tang Ping.

210
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,640
Don't move.

211
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,480
Let's go out.

212
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,640
Let's leave.

213
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Is she okay?

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Aiyah.

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,160
She's okay.

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Look. She's okay.

217
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,240
Look at me.

218
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
When Tang Ping was conscious during the day,

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,990
she was looking and staring at you

220
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,680
with bad intentions.

221
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
Who knows whether she'll take advantage of you

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,710
when she's drunk?

223
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,920
I can't let

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,160
my cutest Ling Rui

225
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,070
be taken advantage of by her.

226
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
You're also very cute.

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Then do you want

228
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
to give me some rewards

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,240
for being so cute?

230
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
What rewards?

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
It's the lobby at the back.

232
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,160
It's crowded.

233
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
It's fine.

234
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,280
Come over.

235
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,520
Come here.

236
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,160
Come here.

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,230
What are you two doing?

238
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,240
What are you doing?

239
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Why did you come out?

240
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640
Fangning,

241
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,830
where did you go?

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,360
Why did you leave

243
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,600
without saying anything?

244
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,480
I thought you'd never come back.

245
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,040
What nonsense are you spouting now?

246
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,280
What happened to you?

247
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,240
Are you drunk?

248
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Why are you crying?

249
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,160
-Tang Ping.
-You're nasty.

250
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm nasty?

251
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,830
You've been nasty since your childhood.

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
You clearly know that

253
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,880
since my childhood, I've always wanted

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
to be good friends with you.

255
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,320
Why have you been bullying me since my childhood?

256
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,870
You hate me, so I also hate you.

257
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,720
Do you know that

258
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
I really envy you?

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,990
You've been doing so well

260
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,640
in everything,

261
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,720
and everyone likes you.

262
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,080
But I can't do anything well,

263
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,520
and I've always been cheated.

264
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,600
Tang Ping.

265
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,160
Look at me.

266
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,280
Enough said.

267
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,440
What are you doing?

268
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,680
You drank too much?

269
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,880
Moreover,

270
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,200
why do you want to compare yourself with me?

271
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,200
Aren't you courting yourself humiliation?

272
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,800
I'm

273
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,030
such a great person,

274
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,760
right?

275
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,600
Okay, stop spouting nonsense.

276
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,920
By the way,

277
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,520
when I scolded that vile pervert

278
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,480
today,

279
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,360
I just imagined

280
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,270
myself like you.

281
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,720
So handsome!

282
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
I found out

283
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
for the first time that

284
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
cursing is such a cool thing.

285
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,120
I feel that it's so handsome.

286
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,600
I really like you so much,

287
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,760
Lu Fangning.

288
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,510
Enough said.

289
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,800
I actually

290
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
don't hate you either.

291
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,280
Tang Ping.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,360
Tang Ping.

293
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
That's enough.

294
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,310
Tang Ping.

295
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,000
None of you men

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
is good.

297
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,240
But you

298
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,270
are considered not bad.

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,790
You...

300
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,440
You...

301
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,760
Tang Ping.

302
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
You're drunk.

303
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,680
Enough said.

304
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,190
Stop making trouble.

305
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,400
Go in and sleep.

306
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,080
You're drunk.

307
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,040
Lu Fangning.

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,960
I

309
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,520
love you.

310
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,720
Tang Ping.

311
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,400
Tang Ping.

312
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,230
Tang Pingping.

313
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,600
Think about it. I'm Lu Fangning.

314
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Who have I served since my childhood?

315
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,990
She vomited, and I had to coax her to sleep.

316
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
That was awful.

317
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,040
Look.

318
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Look.

319
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm like a pig.

320
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm really unsatisfied.

321
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,320
Our romantic night

322
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
was ruined by this fool.

323
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,560
You're not allowed to leave me.

324
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,880
She needs you the most

325
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
right now.

326
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,480
I have to

327
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,800
temporarily lend you to her.

328
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
But I'm not willing to be lent.

329
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
It can't be helped.

330
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm just too lovely.

331
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
Right.

332
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,080
You're indeed too lovely.

333
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,840
So sometimes

334
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,880
it's also quite troublesome.

335
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,400
But

336
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,590
you only love me.

337
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,200
Right.

338
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,150
Fine.

339
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,680
I'll stay with her tonight.

340
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
It's just that

341
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,150
before lending myself to her,

342
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,720
I want her to get

343
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,640
a little punishment.

344
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,720
What punishment?

345
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,320
Come here.

346
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Come and sit here.

347
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,000
Why?

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,520
Darling.

349
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,680
Darling.

350
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,830
This is not that proper.

351
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,320
Just one kiss.

352
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,400
I don't allow that in front of me.

353
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,480
This is really not that good.

354
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,360
Yes.

355
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,280
Whose room is this?

356
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,960
Aiyah!

357
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,240
None of you men

358
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,400
is good.

359
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,760
Lu Fangning.

360
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,640
I

361
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,920
love you.

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,790
I must be crazy.

363
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,560
What did I say to Lu Fangning?

364
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,440
How can I meet her next time?

365
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,080
I want to go home.

366
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,040
I want to go home.

367
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,880
Going home.

368
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,220
[Greenhouse]

369
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,680
Miss Tang.

370
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,280
You're awake.

371
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I...

372
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,760
Ready to leave?

373
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,400
Ling Rui,

374
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,790
why is my apple...

375
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,280
You're awake.

376
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you want to have an apple?

377
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
I...

378
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm not eating.

379
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,520
-You don't like it?
-Don't come over.

380
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,480
Don't come over.

381
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't come over.

382
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,080
What's wrong?

383
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,160
It's that

384
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm already full

385
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
from your PDA.

386
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,080
I don't have to eat this apple then.

387
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,680
This apple

388
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
is really not well peeled.

389
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,310
Honey.

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,760
It's too dramatic.

391
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Well,

392
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,240
I'm not acting.

393
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,320
I was just being nice, asking

394
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
if you want to have breakfast?

395
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
What are you doing?

396
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,120
You stupid...

397
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
Silly girl.

398
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,110
Silly yet cute.

399
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,280
When you are outside alone

400
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,640
next time,

401
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,040
don't drink so much alcohol.

402
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,360
How dangerous it is for a little girl.

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,600
Okay.

404
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
You're...

405
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,760
Planning to leave?

406
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,150
You don't plan to continue

407
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,360
ruining my romantic time?

408
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,440
Aiyah.

409
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,080
After going back this time,

410
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,320
I want to live a good life,

411
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
work hard,

412
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,710
and make money properly.

413
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Hopefully

414
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,630
when you see me next time,

415
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,080
you'll scold me less.

416
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,960
Or

417
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,960
shall we take you to the station?

418
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,480
There's no need.

419
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm fine. Don't bother.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,640
Dr. Ling.

421
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,200
Dr. Ling.

422
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,800
-Something happened.
-What happened?

423
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,430
Hurry up and go to the medical station

424
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,960
to take a look.

425
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,040
Several students fought

426
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,000
and they're injured.

427
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,600
Okay, I got it.

428
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll go over at once.

429
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,200
Okay, hurry up.

430
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,480
Fangning.

431
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm fine.

432
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,320
Patients matter. Hurry up and go.

433
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Okay.

434
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
I'm sorry, Miss Tang.

435
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,520
How about I let Xiaoying take you there?

436
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,000
It's okay.

437
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,670
I have Lu Fangning to see me off.

438
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay, I'll leave first. Fangning.

439
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,960
-I'm leaving.
-Bye-bye.

440
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,880
Xiaoying.

441
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
Come and see Sister Tang Ping off.

442
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,720
Let go of me.

443
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,920
So annoying.

444
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,320
Go down the stairs slowly, Xiaoying.

445
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,760
You're so warmhearted.

446
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
What's the matter? Why are you shy?

447
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
Aiyah, don't be shy.

448
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,560
What's wrong?

449
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,430
Don't walk hand in hand with me.

450
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,670
Why?

451
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,560
Haven't we reconciled?

452
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,560
You don't hate me anymore, right?

453
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,560
That's enough.

454
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,960
Okay.

455
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,640
Stop teasing you.

456
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,670
I'll wait for you.

457
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Why will you wait for me?

458
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
Didn't you say that

459
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,040
you're seeing me next time?

460
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,400
Goodbye.

461
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,760
See you next time.

462
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,240
Then

463
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm leaving.

464
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,440
You can go now.

465
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,480
Leave now.

466
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,600
Leave now. What are you doing?

467
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,390
Bye-bye.

468
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,760
Bye-bye.

469
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,040
We must see each other again.

470
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Goodbye.

471
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,480
Bye-bye!

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Go now.

473
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,560
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

474
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,870
Brother Ling Rui's wife,

475
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
is this sister

476
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,030
just like you,

477
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,440
who also likes Brother Ling Rui very much?

478
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,270
What nonsense are you spouting?

479
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,000
But I think that

480
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,240
although she likes you so much,

481
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,440
she'd been messing around

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,830
between you and Ling Rui.

483
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,510
But it's obvious that

484
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,590
you only fancy Ling Rui.

485
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,960
After all,

486
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,640
Brother Ling Rui is so great.

487
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,120
Indeed.

488
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,440
As you can see,

489
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,550
I'm really quite lovely.

490
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,190
But

491
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,430
I only have Ling Rui in my heart.

492
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,000
Of course, Ling Rui is also very good.

493
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,560
But sister,

494
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,000
you don't have to be sad.

495
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,080
Why would I be sad?

496
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,950
In fact,

497
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,760
Brother Ling Rui

498
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
has had someone whom he's been into for a long time.

499
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,120
I know. It's me.

500
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,870
No.

501
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,640
It was really a long time ago.

502
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
I heard from my mother that Brother Ling Rui

503
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,550
has been into that girl

504
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,800
since high school.

505
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,960
Sister-in-law,

506
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,840
have you and Ling Rui

507
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,320
known each other for that long?

508
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,240
Well,

509
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,240
it's not that long.

510
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,880
Right?

511
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I heard that

512
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,520
Brother Ling Rui

513
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,560
has been keeping a coin.

514
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,840
It was given by the one

515
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,440
whom he's into.

516
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,550
This is a gift for you.

517
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,630
A coin?

518
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,040
With the motif

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,280
of an amusement park on it?

520
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,840
How did you know?

521
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,520
Because that's mine.

522
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,110
But didn't you say that

523
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,120
you and Brother Ling Rui

524
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,760
haven't known each other for that long?

525
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,790
You're a little kid.

526
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,200
Why do you have so many questions?

527
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
If you keep asking me,

528
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,990
I won't help you

529
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,800
to get Brother Ling Rui's

530
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,600
lucky item.

531
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,560
Really?

532
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,440
Sister-in-law,

533
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,560
do you really want to give it to me?

534
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,280
Sister-in-law, you're so nice.

535
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,630
Here is the place

536
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,710
where Ling Rui used to go to school.

537
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,640
The person he's into

538
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
should be his classmate.

539
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,480
Senior, I'm into you.

540
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,190
No. Thank you.

541
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:35,160
[Books bring eternal benefits to me]

542
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,270
Is your hand hurt?

543
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,520
Let me see.

544
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,880
Don't move.

545
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,350
Why did you fight?

546
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,120
He laughed at me.

547
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,280
They all laughed at me.

548
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
They said I picked up food

549
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,870
and clothes for a living.

550
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,280
Saying that I was a beggar,

551
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,440
picking up what others didn't want.

552
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,880
Are you then?

553
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,040
Of course not.

554
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,200
Why were you angry then?

555
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,160
My family is poor.

556
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,160
Even the tuition fee is paid by the teacher.

557
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,840
We share the same clothes.

558
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
Finally, I got new clothes,

559
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
which were left unwanted by my classmate.

560
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,560
I have to go to school every day,

561
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,400
wearing old clothes that others don't want.

562
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,480
What a shame.

563
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
I still have to go to the teacher in the afternoon

564
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,440
to take the lunch that others don't want.

565
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,760
They must be mocking me

566
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,400
in their hearts.

567
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,840
They must be laughing at me.

568
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,360
Forget it, how can you understand?

569
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,550
I understand.

570
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,120
I also had

571
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,920
the experience of wearing

572
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
classmates' old clothes to school.

573
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,920
I also had

574
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,560
the experience

575
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,360
of standing in the corridor

576
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
and having bread given by the teacher.

577
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,320
I had experienced all of these.

578
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,520
So what?

579
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,520
You're smart.

580
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
You had excellent results.

581
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,280
So I have to study hard

582
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,840
to be like you.

583
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,760
Did you mean so?

584
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,720
What I want to say

585
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,000
is that I can understand your feeling.

586
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes.

587
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
When I was in school,

588
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,710
my results were pretty good.

589
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,190
So maybe

590
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,120
I had to go to the podium frequently

591
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
to express my gratitude in public.

592
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,560
I need to thank

593
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,760
and bow.

594
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,280
To thank classmates and teachers for their help,

595
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,240
although some of them

596
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
didn't deserve it.

597
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,200
Didn't you have self-esteem?

598
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Compared to self-esteem,

599
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,800
I have something more important.

600
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm not asking you to abandon self-esteem

601
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,640
by telling you this.

602
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,680
I want you to keep it well instead.

603
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,120
If you're feeling angry

604
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,110
towards others due to this,

605
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,000
that's really giving up on yourself

606
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,080
and giving up dignity.

607
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm not as strong as you.

608
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
I'm not strong, too.

609
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll also be angry.

610
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,640
I'll also lose control.

611
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,550
Really?

612
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,160
Correct.

613
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
I'm just an ordinary person, too.

614
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,040
But fortunately,

615
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,040
at that time,

616
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,830
I met someone.

617
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,510
That person

618
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
once confessed her love

619
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,280
in front of me.

620
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,040
Although the way her using a coin

621
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,790
as a token of love

622
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,920
was childish,

623
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,240
it's been warming me up.

624
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
It's just like

625
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
a person who is about to drown

626
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,800
managing to grab a floating board.

627
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,910
She saved me.

628
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,080
And now,

629
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,680
I also hope to be your floating board.

630
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Floating board?

631
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,320
I thought that it was me.

632
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,640
It's the coin again.

633
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
I didn't expect that this coin

634
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,160
is so important to him.

635
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,840
It's lucky that

636
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,630
I always carry it with me.

637
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,350
Forget it.

638
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll reluctantly inherit you.

639
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,520
Where's the coin?

640
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm doomed.

641
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Drop dead!

642
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,640
Pervert!

643
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,000
Let's swap. Okay.

644
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,630
It's not a game coin.

645
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Whose coin is this?

646
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:52,730
[Nanshan Town Medical Center]

647
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
Come and get some sugar-coated haws.

648
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,720
I lost it again.

649
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,960
I really don't share an affinity

650
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,920
with this coin?

651
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,680
I even don't mind inheriting you.

652
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
You still dislike me?

653
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,400
Hey.

654
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,240
The school has always had a tradition.

655
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,520
The lower and upper grades

656
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,120
have to learn in a pair.

657
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,550
Hello, my name is Ling Rui.

658
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,000
What's your name?

659
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,910
The White Queen of the Golden Forest.

660
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Just call me Queen.

661
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,760
Hello, Queen.

662
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,760
Teacher Xu asked me

663
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,800
to come and help you with your homework.

664
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,710
No. I can't and I won't.

665
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,080
These inferior questions

666
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,240
don't fit my vibe at all.

667
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,440
I'll first write out

668
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,800
the thought processes of ​​answering the questions for you.

669
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,430
You...

670
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,640
You didn't say not to read.

671
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,800
Then I don't want to do homework here.

672
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,990
Where are you going to do it?

673
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,520
My territory.

674
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,040
Which place is it?

675
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,270
Forget it, come with me.

676
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,750
Let's go and play the next one.

677
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,830
Which one to play?

678
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:28,720
That one.

679
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,480
Let's play it after you've finished your homework.

680
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,160
I'll do it later.

681
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,840
You do it first.

682
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,880
Work on this.

683
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,800
With the level of Queen,

684
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,120
half an hour should be enough.

685
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm done.

686
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,400
Less than half an hour.

687
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,160
Let's go.

688
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Pack my schoolbag for me.

689
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,360
Look at me.

690
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,470
Let's continue doing it.

691
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,640
Come again if you like it.

692
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,960
Let's eat cotton candy.

693
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,920
I'm not eating.

694
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,320
You haven't finished your homework yet.

695
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,720
I treat you.

696
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,360
Nanny,

697
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
get me two cotton candies.

698
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,280
Okay.

699
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,030
Keep the change.

700
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,710
Keep the change.

701
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,520
Okay.

702
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,320
-Here.
-Thank you.

703
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,030
Thank you.

704
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,160
Let's go and do homework.

705
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,000
Be careful.

706
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,560
I'm done.

707
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,760
Little teacher,

708
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,680
don't you want to play?

709
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,560
I'm not playing.

710
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,200
Boring.

711
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,760
Hold the cotton candies properly.

712
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,110
It's the Queen's ride.

713
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:00,920
I'm coming.

714
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,560
Nanny,

715
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,000
can I borrow your camera?

716
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,640
Sure.

717
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,880
But I have no money.

718
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,760
You bought cotton candies

719
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,480
and paid me more than they cost

720
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,680
just now.

721
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,000
Just take it.

722
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,510
Remember to give it back to Nanny.

723
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,280
Do you know how to use it?

724
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,880
Yes, I do.

725
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,120
Good.

726
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,680
Thank you.

727
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,160
Be careful.

728
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,040
Little teacher,

729
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,480
show me my photos.

730
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
Am I pretty?

731
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,680
Am I?

732
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,200
-Am I?
-Yes.

733
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,880
You're actually quite good-looking.

734
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,560
You'll be my subject from now on.

735
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,880
Call me when anything happens.

736
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,200
I'm The White Queen of the Golden Forest,

737
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,600
Ningning.

738
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,920
The kid behind.

739
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,200
Yes, higher.

740
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,510
One, two, three.

741
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,480
Here's one photo.

742
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,840
Sit properly.

743
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,630
Let's take one more photo.

744
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,230
Hello.

745
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,640
I can't teach you anymore in the future.

747
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:25,960
Hello,

748
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
this is the city hospital.

749
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,040
You lost our photo

750
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,160
just like that.

751
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,590
When you came to me,

752
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,080
my dad just passed away.

753
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,160
His surgery

754
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,440
was delayed again and again.

755
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,520
I thought it must be because

756
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,560
we were poor.

757
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,360
So I could only witness

758
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,280
his situation

759
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,360
getting worse.

760
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,320
At last,

761
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,040
I almost broke down.

762
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,790
Little teacher.

763
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,120
Finally, I found you.

764
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,630
What's wrong with you?

765
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,310
Is someone bullying you?

766
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,640
I'll teach him a lesson.

767
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm the queen.

768
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,120
No one here is going to play with you.

769
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,440
What happened to you?

770
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,680
Tell me.

771
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,000
My family is rich.

772
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,160
My dad said that

773
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,910
in this world,

774
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,480
money can solve all the problems.

775
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,640
Look. I have money.

776
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,440
I'm giving you all of my money.

777
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,830
I don't want it.

778
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,080
What do you want?

779
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,480
I only have money.

780
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,400
What should I do?

781
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,680
How can I help you?

782
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,200
I can give you whatever you need.

783
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,440
You...

784
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,840
Why are you so kind to me?

785
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,600
Because you played with me in the amusement park

786
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
and looked at me laughing.

787
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,560
You have a great smile.

788
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,200
I don't want to see you like this.

789
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,360
I want you to laugh, too.

790
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,800
For this one,

791
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,080
I accepted it.

792
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,880
You can regard the money accepted

793
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,920
as the deposit.

794
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,440
I'll earn more money

795
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,680
when I grow up,

796
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,000
and I'll marry you, okay?

797
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,360
The White Queen of the Golden Forest.

798
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Little teacher.

799
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,280
Long time no see.

800
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,080
Long time no see.

801
00:45:59,180 --> 00:45:59,960
Unfortunately,

802
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,390
I lost

803
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,480
your marriage deposit.

804
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,150
Why is it with you?

805
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,560
All things that are lost

806
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,600
will be found.

807
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,080
It's like the fate

808
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,800
between us.

809
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:31,480
Fangning.

810
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,040
In your past,

811
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,720
I may not be special.

812
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,560
But you're very important

813
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,600
to me in my life.

814
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,240
It's you

815
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,040
who prevented me from

816
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,920
being in excruciating pain.

817
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,640
You made me realize

818
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,600
that someone would help me.

819
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,880
You made me realize

820
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,000
that I wasn't

821
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,720
a weak person,

822
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,600
and I could also bring hope to others.

823
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
If it was without you,

824
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,040
I might have done something

825
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,310
that I may regret later.

826
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,520
Afterward

827
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,600
I heard from Professor Luo

828
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,600
that for my dad's illness,

829
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,880
there was basically no chance for surgery.

830
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
It's them who tried their best

831
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,480
to extend his lifespan again and again.

832
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,160
So

833
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,400
I made up my mind to study medicine,

834
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,200
trying to overcome

835
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,280
this medical difficulty.

836
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,640
So that's why

837
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,720
you want to study abroad

838
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,600
so eagerly.

839
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,080
So it's because of this.

840
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,520
I thought

841
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
that I agreed with your marriage contract

842
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,680
was because I was grateful towards you.

843
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,000
But afterward, I found out

844
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,000
that I'd do only you

845
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,320
such a favor

846
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,480
in my life.
