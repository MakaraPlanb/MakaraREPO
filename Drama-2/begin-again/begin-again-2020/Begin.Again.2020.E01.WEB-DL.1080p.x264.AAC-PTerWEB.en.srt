[Episode 01]

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,600
Do you know

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,840
who the bride is today?

6
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,959
No idea.

7
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Lu Fangning.

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,640
The general manager of LM Deer Sing Group.

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
The daughter of the Lu family.

10
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,600
Having a favorable family background
and with a beautiful look,

11
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,080
she is competent, powerful

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
and dominant.

13
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,130
No one in Deer Sing Group

14
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,480
dares to go against her.

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,680
Lu Fangning

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,330
doesn't look like a woman.

Business partners.

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,529
Everyone who interacts with her

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
will all be conquered by her.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
There is no exception.

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Of course, my son-in-law

23
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,520
should be great.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,600
He can take a fancy to my daughter.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
He must be extraordinary.

26
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,320
Ling Rui,

27
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,490

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
Ms. Lu.

30
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,279
Ms. Lu.

31
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,039
I will report to you

32
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,120
today's work schedule.

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,610
Ms. Lu.

34
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,760
Today the opening price of Deer Sing is

35
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
35.65 yuan.

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
1.3 yuan higher

37
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
than we predicted yesterday.

38
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,920
The Finance Department

39
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,640
has finished auditing.

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,290
They found

41
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,760
a four million cash transfer record

42
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
from your brother, Mr. Lu Fangyu's

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,960
private account.

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,600
By the way,

45
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
this is the 38th time

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,359
your brother applies to meet you.

47
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,240
What would you like to do?

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,810
I won't see him.

49
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,080
Freeze his credit cards.

50
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,840
He will have three days

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
to return the money.

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
Yes. This is the earning statement
of the month.

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
The Finance Department

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,690
has completed it.

55
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,600
It showed a year-over-year increase

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
of 27%.

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
This is ahead of the industry's average.

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
If this trend continues,

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,090
the turnover at the end of the year

60
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,960
will be at least two times more than
that of the previous year

61
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,359
if everything goes well.

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,040
At 2.00 p.m., you have a conference call

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,320
with Fengmu Group, the supplier.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
In a while, you will have to attend

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
the board meeting

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,920
to discuss the R&D

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
of the new brand.

68
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,880
Above is

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,480
today's schedule.

70
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:05,359
If there are any changes,

71
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,080
I will report to you immediately.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,910
Ms. Lu.

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,560
Ms. Lu, one last thing...

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,360
Mr. Lu wonders

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,530
when are you free
to have a blind date this week?

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,040
When I went through A106

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
of the first floor,

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
I saw

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,640
an empty shelf

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
with nothing display on it.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
I will inform the person in charge

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
to arrange it again.

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
Can you explain

84
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
why does the household magazine shelf

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,970
opposite of the B209 store

86
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,880
on the second floor

87
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,600
has a fashion magazine

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
on it?

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,280
I will send someone to handle it.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,600
I saw a female employee of M311

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,640
sitting on our brown leather sofa

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
which cannot be sat on.

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,120
She was flirting with her client.

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,609
I will notify the HR

95
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,720
to fire her

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
and pursue the responsibility

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,080
of the staff who recruited her.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
Fire, fire, fire!

99
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
You only know to fire the staff.

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Do you think you are in a drama,

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,080
acting a potent boss?

102
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,850
Do you think you look handsome?

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,359
Just a warning will do, isn't it?

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

105
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
What did you say just now?

106
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,200
Mr. Lu asked you...

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,210
The previous one.

108
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,000
There's

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,680
a regular board meeting later.

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Why do we need to spend money again?

111
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
Why are you building another new brand?

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,000
Just tell me.

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,450
How does that make sense?

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
Mr. Lu is semi-retired.

115
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,880
Ms. Lu is so young,

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,690
and is eager to prove herself.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,560
After all, she is a girl.

118
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,800
It's natural for her to have short sight.

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Yes.

120
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,850
Just because she's a Lu?

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's so great about that?

122
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
It's great to have the surname Lu.

123
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,880
But, to take this seat,

124
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
one needs to be capable enough.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,930
However,

126
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,800
I don't have any tips

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
to share with you.

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
I'll just

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
give you a suggestion.

130
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,680
Do more, speak less.

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,080
Besides,

132
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
the broad director who spoke just now.

133
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
Please look at Deer Sing's profit

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,440
last year.

135
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,960
The turnover is three times more than

136
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,840
that of the year before.

137
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,960
To be specific,

138
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,320
285%.

139
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
I welcome anyone

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
to screw Deer Sing Group up in this way.

141
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
Everyone, please have a look at the data.

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
According to the basic data,

143
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
the mean age of Deer Sing Group's
main customers

144
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,120
is increasing.

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,600
Basically, every month,

146
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
we lose young customers.

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,690
Before other household brands

148
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,400
take away the youth market completely

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
and surpass

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Deer Sing Group's market share,

151
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,520
we must surpass ourselves.

152
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Infinity

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
is our new weapon

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
to take over

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
the youth market.

156
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,740
[Infinity]

157
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,170
Everyone,

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,850
I don't have to

159
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,560
prove myself.

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,080
I am a member of the Lu family.

161
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,000
I can do nothing

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
because my family has enough money.

163
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,240
But board directors,

164
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,160
if you want to double

165
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
your income next year,

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,120
this is the chance.

167
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
A week later,

168
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,760
we will be here again to vote for

169
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
the establishment of Infinity.

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
You are welcome

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,480
to bring along your brains...

172
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,960
Your love for Deer Sing in your brains.

173
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,320
The meeting is dismissed.

174
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
What does she know?

175
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
Narrow view.

176
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
Birds of a feather.

177
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Hypocrites.

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,160
Ms. Lu.

179
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
The market survey of Infinity

180
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,400
and the brand planning

181
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,730
have been ongoing for a year.

182
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,360
But the board members are against it.

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,640
I am afraid that we cannot make progress.

184
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,840
How many possibilities do we have?

185
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,720
According to the rules, we need
more than half of the votes

186
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,800
to get the proposal passed.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Now, we have 17 directors.

188
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,360
Mr. Li and Mr. Yang at the meeting,

189
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
and other three directors

190
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
have stood firm against this.

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Mr. Tang still holds a wait-and-see attitude.

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,119
Other directors haven't expressed
their stands.

193
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,200
Besides, Ms. Xiao who was absent

194
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,440
has a high status on the board.

195
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,759
Her vote is very important.

196
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,239
Recently, no one has clearly stood for

197
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,920
the setup of Infinity.

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,760
To speak generously,

199
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,040
there will be 16 votes against you.

200
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
There is one vote for me.

201
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,720
Your own vote.

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Why Xiao Yingzhi

203
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
has been absent for

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
the board meeting?

205
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Ms. Xiao is on maternity leave.

206
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,720
She just delivered last week.

207
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Let's go to the hospital.

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,440
Do we need to prepare any gifts?

209
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
Lu Fangning?

210
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,360
Yingzhi.

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
You have recovered so well!

212
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,040
How can you look prettier than

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,800
when you were

214
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
in the company?

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,480
You are really glowing.

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,760
Let me have a look.

217
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
You have recovered so well.

218
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh, baby.

219
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,000
The baby is so cute.

220
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
He looks just like you.

221
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,200
Yingzhi, what's his name?

222
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,880
Ms. Xiao, Ms. Lu.

223
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,840
Take your time.

224
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
I've got to go.

225
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,570
Go ahead.

226
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
Do you have dissociative personality disorder?

227
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,000
Ms. Xiao is so humorous.

228
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
I have sent the baby diapers,

229
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,680
and have come here

230
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,040
to pay you a sincere visit.

231
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
I won't bother you any longer.

232
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
I know you are here

233
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,440
for the voting.

234
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,640
But I can tell you now

235
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
that I'm not going to vote for it.

236
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,680
Ms. Lu,

237
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,840
Infinity is

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
a household brand

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,160
mainly for young people.

240
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
But, as far as I know,

241
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,810
Ms. Lu,

242
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
in your life,

243
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,080
you have nothing

244
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
other than your career.

245
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,360
How can you make me believe that

246
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
a person with no spice of life

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
can run

248
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,720
such a brand well?

249
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
For you,

250
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,640
what is life?

251
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,120
Do I have to give birth to a child,

252
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
feed him and raise him to have a life?

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,080
Don't you want to take a look, Ms. Lu?

254
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,650
I believe, in the near future,

255
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,560
you will not have

256
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
such opportunities.

257
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
Alright. Let me see

258
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
what is it on earth

259
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,280
that makes

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,320
our demonic woman to give up

261
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
the opportunities for earning money

262
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,880
so willingly?

263
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,960
He's so small.

264
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,760
Well.

265
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,520
Since you are here,

266
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,760
why don't you stay longer?

267
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,890
Also,

268
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,720
I can go out enjoy the scent of coffee.

269
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
Take good care of him.

270
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,480
Here.

271
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
Are you holding it or not?

272
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,960
It's okay if you don't want it.
But, why are you crying?

273
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,960
Don't cry!

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,360
It's not me who made you cry.

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I didn't scold you.

276
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
Don't cry!

277
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,360
It seems like

278
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I was bullying you.

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Xiao Yingzhi.

280
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,090
Xiao Yingzhi, sorry.

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
Your baby is crying.

282
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,400
Well.

283
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Stop crying!

284
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,880
This is not working.

285
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,560
Don't cry!

286
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,920
Well.

287
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,440
Let me try.

288
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,250
You can hold him like this.

289
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,000
Support his head with one hand.

290
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
Then, use the other hand

291
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
to support his bum and thighs.

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
The newborns

293
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,160
have a soft spine.

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
So, you must be careful.

295
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,400
Although babies were born,

296
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,320
they also enjoy sounds and embrace.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
You can calm him down

298
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,880
by letting him listen
to your voice and heartbeat.

299
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
Then, he will feel safe.

300
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
Do you want to touch him?

301
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,960
Babies also like

302
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,880
being touched.

303
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,650
Are you that terrifying, baby?

304
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,160
He smiled.

305
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,050
All right, so,

306
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,930
lie down

307
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,610
and have a rest.

308
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,120
He's so cute.

309
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
I was just passing by

310
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,040
when I heard the baby crying.

311
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
So, I decided to drop by.

312
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Thanks, doctor.

313
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
It's my job.

314
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Take your time. I shall leave first.

315
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,840
[Mr. Li]

316
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,680
You are here

317
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,040
just for this?

318
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,520
Who did it? Let me have a look.

319
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,920
Mr. Li,

320
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,050
Yingzhi has recovered well.

321
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't worry.

322
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,000
Gao Erfan's photography skills

323
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,160
have really improved.

324
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,640
Here.

325
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,880
Lu Fangning.

326
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,400
Lu Fangning.

327
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Lu Fangning.

328
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,640
Good photos. I will give you an increment.

329
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,000
Hello.

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
No need to make appointments for now.
Leave him alone first.

331
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,400
I will deal with the contract.

332
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,960
I am at...

333
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
Hello.

334
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,840
Which room am I in?

335
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
It doesn't matter.

336
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,360
So,

337
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,120
I will see you in the hall

338
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,000
of the hospital.

339
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Okay, bye.

340
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,720
I am finished. Please continue.

341
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,480
You are not leaving yet?

342
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,800
I am so sorry.

343
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,320
Well...

344
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,690
Today, I forgot my business card

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,840
when I came out.

346
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,850
Later,

347
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,890
we can get to

348
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,680
know each other properly.

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,840
Miss,

350
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,720
do you know that

351
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,120
this is my office?

352
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
Doctor,

353
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,080
have you ever thought that

354
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,040
maybe it's our fate

355
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,520
that guides me into your office?

356
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,730
How?

357
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,720
Phone number? WeChat?

358
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,800
I can accept both.

359
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,000
Have you seen Director Ling?

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
I just saw him entering his office.

361
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,400
Alright.

362
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Follow me.

363
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,519
Ling Rui,

364
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
here is the working schedule

365
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,160
for the next week.

366
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you want to have a look?

367
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,799
I will look at it later. Leave it here.

368
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,760
No one is here. Why did you pull the curtain?

369
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,279
Open it.

370
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,200
I... I am changing.

371
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,920
Stop staring.

372
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
No, I need you to sign here.

373
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,640
Open the curtain now.

374
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
I will sign it later. Later!

375
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,860
[Ling Rui]

376
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,240
I am changing my trousers. Don't move!

377
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,560
Come on.

378
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,320
Hurry up.

379
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Hurry up!

380
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,370
I am taking off my trousers. Don't open it!

381
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,050
Come on.

382
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,240
Let me have a look.

383
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,880
There's nothing to see.

384
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,760
Just a glance!

385
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,440
Just let me have a look.

386
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,160
There's nothing to see.

387
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,930
-No!
-Just once!

388
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,440
Just let me have a look.

389
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,410
Are you hiding someone here?

390
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:53,920
Just let me have a look.

391
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,400
Let me have a look.

392
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
Let me have a look.

393
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,240
-Let me have a look.
-Peng Bo.

394
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,680
Okay.

395
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
You are mean.

396
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,530
I am leaving.

397
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,360
Hi.

398
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
I... I am leaving.

399
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,560
Con... Continue.

400
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,730
He's gone.

401
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,280
You're blushing.

402
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,360
Why are you so shy?

403
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,440
I don't even feel shy.

404
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,600
By the way,

405
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,520
I was talking about your abs.

406
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
I was saying that

407
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,040
your abs are hard.

408
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,240
Thanks.

409
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,960
I should be the one to say thanks.

410
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
This is an office.

411
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,280
You shouldn't enter without permission.

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
I didn't.

413
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,760
There was an emergency.

414
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,560
An emergency?

415
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Nothing. It's over now.

416
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,520
After all, for the things just now,

417
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
you can just regard them as

418
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,440
me losing control of myself

419
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
and coveting for beautiful things.

420
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,480
That's all.

421
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
That's a compliment.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Anyway,

423
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,200
I will apologize

424
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,160
for bothering you.

425
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,720
I accept your apology.

426
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
But, please don't do this anymore.

427
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
If you meet someone else,

428
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,600
you may get bullied.

429
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,440
Girls should know

430
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,720
how to protect themselves.

431
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,450
Thanks.

432
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,610
Same to the boys.

433
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
Dr. Ling,

434
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,400
you look really good.

435
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,520
You buttoned wrongly.

436
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Ms. Lu.

437
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,400
-Gao Erfan.
-Yes!

438
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,560
Have you ever seen an angel?

439
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,480
Do I look like someone

440
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,690
who'll get bullied easily?

441
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
You have done well today.

442
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,280
You said about raising my pay just now.

443
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,040
By how much?

444
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
Next, we'll have to convince

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,760
the old man.

446
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
You can have a half-day off.

447
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,800
Thanks, Ms. Lu.

448
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,090
I heard that last month,

449
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,000
for no reason,

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,720
you wanted to change the spokesperson
of the company.

451
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,880
The month before last month,

452
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
many people saw

453
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,320
the partners of our company

454
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,280
walked out of your office,

455
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,720
looking really embarrassed.

456
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,440
Let me ask you.

457
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,360
Where are your manners?

458
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,040
What do you really want?

459
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,210
Your wife has delivered misinformation.

460
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,720
The spokesperson of the company is a female.

461
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,730
The partner is also a female.

462
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,480
I am a female too.

463
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,080
I will not

464
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,000
be rude to them.

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
But to you, it's different.

466
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,400
Ms. Lu is a female?

467
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,080
If you don't remind me,
I wouldn't have known that.

468
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,240
My mother gave birth to me.

469
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
You didn't raise me.

470
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,330
You might really have no idea.

471
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,730
Alright.

472
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
I won't say too much.

473
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Prepare yourself.

474
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,200
Get ready to get married.

475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,960
I won't get married.

476
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
Why?

477
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,480
You're not young.

478
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
You are a woman.
If you don't want to get married,

479
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
what are you going to do?

480
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
I am smart and wealthy.

481
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,240
Why should I get married?

482
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,000
Does marriage do any good to me?

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,880
Mom.

484
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,080
Don't eavesdrop.

485
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,920
Smart and wealthy.

486
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,000
Is this why you don't want to get married?

487
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,800
You are a woman.

488
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,720
If you don't get married or bear a child,

489
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
your life as a woman

490
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,120
will not be complete.

491
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,530
Get it?

492
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,520
When you set the sales target

493
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
of the company,

494
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
you didn't say that.

495
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
You are so eloquent.

496
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,200
Remember.

497
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,720
Within a year,

498
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,000
if you can get married

499
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,600
and bear a child,

500
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
then it's okay.

501
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,290
If you can't do that,

502
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,360
even if the entire board

503
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
approve of Infinity,

504
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,840
I have the

505
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,600
veto power

506
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,960
to ban Infinity with just one vote.

507
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
You're the one

508
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,120
who has no right to ban Infinity.

509
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Fangning.

510
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Sister.

511
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,680
Are you having dinner at home?

512
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,880
I will cook for you.

513
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,800
I don't want to eat your cooking.

514
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,760
It's terrible.

515
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,960
Look at what you have done.

516
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,440
Sister.

517
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
Don't leave in such a hurry!

518
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,840
Wenbin,

519
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
did you hear what your good daughter

520
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,920
say to me?

521
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
She has no respect even to me,

522
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,920
much less to you,

523
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,040
the Chairman's wife,

524
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,160
and the lawful stepmother.

525
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,640
You can stay where you like.

526
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,360
Sister.

527
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,880
I cannot afford to pay back

528
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,760
of four million yuan.

529
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,480
Seeing that

530
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm your brother,

531
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,200
give me some extension, please?

532
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,600
Sister, I didn't use the money

533
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,920
to do anything bad.

534
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I only lend it out.

535
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Please, give me one month.

536
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,480
One month.

537
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,000
Five days.

538
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,720
I will give you five more days.

539
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
If you still cannot pay it,

540
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,440
for the rest of your life,

541
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,880
you'll not get your credit card back.

542
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:17,760
Sister.

543
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,040
Sister.

544
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
Mr. Lu is semi-retired.

545
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,600
Ms. Lu is so young,

546
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,480
and is eager to prove herself.

547
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,080
After all, she is a girl.

548
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,400
It's natural for her to have short sight.

549
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,010
In your life,

550
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,040
you have nothing,

551
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,960
other than your career.

552
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,080
How can you make me believe that

553
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,490
a person with no spice of life

554
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,840
can run

555
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,640
such a brand well?

556
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,920
Remember.

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Within a year,

558
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,800
if you can get married

559
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,450
and bear a child,

560
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,160
then it's okay.

561
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,880
If you can't do that,

562
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,760
even if the entire board

563
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
approve of Infinity,

564
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,240
I have the

565
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
veto power.

566
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,440
To ban Infinity with just one vote.

567
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,390
[Gao Erfan]

568
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,200
Ms. Lu,

569
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,120
Chairman

570
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,330
just announced to the board

571
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,280
that they would suspend

572
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,720
the establishment of Infinity.

573
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,680
Okay.

574
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,800
Okay.

575
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
In fact, my wishes

576
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
are really simple.

577
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,880
Before 30 years old,

578
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,840
I want to get married,

579
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
have a baby

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
and

581
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,280
my own household brand.

582
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
Old fox, I promise you

583
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,610
to get married and have a child in a year.

584
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,080
But, you'd better keep your words.

585
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,130
Don't play any trick

586
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,000
to hinder me.

587
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,880
Although I agree to

588
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,560
your terms,

589
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,800
it doesn't mean that

590
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,920
I agree that

591
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,320
a woman should act like a woman.

592
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,960
Marriage and family are never reasons

593
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,400
to trap a woman.

594
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,600
Listen to me carefully.

595
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,040
You and my destiny

596
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,640
are no match for me.

597
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,480
You can place his head here.

598
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,760
Arms, here.

599
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,040
It's not that hard.

600
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,920
I will have my own baby.

601
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,920
Mr. Right...

602
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,480
Ms. Lu,

603
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,640
this is the blind date list

604
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,330
prepared for you.

605
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,400
What do you think of this one?

606
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,240
Ugly.

607
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
What about this one?

608
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,200
Uncultured.

609
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,040
He's good.

610
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,240
Spoilt.

611
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,880
These are young and talented men

612
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
who match

613
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,200
your intelligence and age.

614
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,160
I think your Chinese is not good.

615
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,040
You don't know
what's a young and talented man.

616
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Intelligence and age?

617
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
At least let me know your standard.

618
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
So, I can have a direction

619
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
in finding men who match your standard.

620
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,720
Anyhow, none of these are acceptable.

621
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,720
How do I find other candidates?

622
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,440
Do you like someone like me?

623
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,720
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

624
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,130
You don't have to do this.

625
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,560
Hello, everyone.

626
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,960
It's been a while.

627
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,370
I miss you too.

628
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,400
Don't you always say that

629
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm very athletic?

630
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,570
Today, I'll show you

631
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,720
the results

632
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,120
of my daily practices.

633
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,120
This is where

634
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,240
I usually practice.

635
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,560
It's quite tiring.

636
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,280
But, the coach said that I have potential.

637
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,010
So, cheer for me!

638
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Raise your hands.

639
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,000
Focus.

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Coach.

641
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,920
Am I fighting

642
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,960
against the female coach today?

643
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
I've informed her.

644
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,570
She's on leave today.

645
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,640
Perhaps

646
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,760
you can practice with her?

647
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,200
Lu Fangning?

648
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,960
Ready, go.

649
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,520
Please save me some face, Fangning.

650
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
My fans are watching.

651
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
Let me win one round.

652
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,890
Whatever happened before

653
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,480
shall be forgotten.

654
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,720
Come on.

655
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,760
She broke my arm.

656
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,160
Lu Fangning, you broke my arm.

657
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,840
Stop filming.

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,240
It hurts.

659
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,440
Dial 120.

660
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,450
Yes.

661
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Lu Fangning,

662
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,970
if you dare to leave me with the ambulance,

663
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,160
I will tell my father to

664
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
vote against you

665
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,960
during the board meeting.

666
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,010
Send me to the hospital now.

667
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
The nearest one.

668
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,600
I want to go to the hospital.

669
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,520
Hospital...

670
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,760
Gao Erfan, send her in.

671
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,450
I need to deal with something.

672
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,200
Yes, Ms. Lu.

673
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,130
Where are you going?

674
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,760
Gao Erfan.

675
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,120
-Ms. Tang.
-Don't move.

676
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,280
Stay there!

677
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,530
Stay there!

678
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,080
You're responsible for this.

679
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
What did I do to you

680
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,720
to be responsible for this?

681
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,170
My arm is fractured.

682
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,680
If you dare to leave,

683
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
I will tell my father not to vote for you.

684
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,360
You're so noisy.

685
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,280
You!

686
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,920
Lu Fangning, wait a moment.

687
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,160
Push it.

688
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,760
What's the matter?

689
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,120
Your legs are broken too?

690
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
I don't care. Push it.

691
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,440
I think

692
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,760
you hurt your brain too.

693
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,680
Are you going to push it?

694
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,200
If you don't,

695
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600
I will tell my father not to vote for you

696
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,280
I know. I know.

697
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,720
Your father, your father...

698
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,600
You keep talking about

699
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,880
your father.

700
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,520
Well, maybe I can bring you

701
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
to the Pediatric Department.

702
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,000
How about that?

703
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,680
You!

704
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
I know.

705
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,400
Ms. Tang Pingping,

706
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,440
I'll bring you to register and pay the bills.

707
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
Is that enough?

708
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,480
That should be the way.

709
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,050
-Hold this.
-Okay.

710
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
-Are we done?
-Yes.

711
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,040
Thanks.

712
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,680
Let me have a look.

713
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,280
This is so painful.

714
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,880
Miss, I haven't touched you.

715
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,920
I am just about to check and see

716
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,120
if you need an X-ray.

717
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,400
I don't want you to do the check-up.

718
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Are you an intern?

719
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,080
I want the professional ones!

720
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I want your director.

721
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,880
I want your director
to do the check-up for me.

722
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
Miss, if you keep raising a ruckus,

723
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,600
I'll have to call the security

724
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,370
to bring you out.

725
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,930
I want to see the doctor. I am sick.

726
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,810
I am making reasonable requirements.

727
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,400
How can you say that I am making a fuss?

728
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,160
Miss.

729
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,610
You are unreasonable.

730
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,760
Miss.

731
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,530
This is the emergency room.

732
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,840
Don't hinder

733
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,720
the doctor's job.

734
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,760
I didn't.

735
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
Please apologize to this doctor.

736
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,120
I am sorry.

737
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,000
Stand up.

738
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,800
Don't hog the medical resources.

739
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,680
Thanks, Director Ling.

740
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,760
Do you still need treatment?

741
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,720
Where is your next-of-kin?

742
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,560
Are they here?

743
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,960
There.

744
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,609
Excuse me, doctors.

745
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,600
This child

746
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,080
has an intellectual disability.

747
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm sorry she troubled you.

748
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,960
It's alright. I can see that.

749
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,120
Where were you?

750
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,399
I have something to do.

751
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,439
You have to be responsible for this!

752
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,680
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

753
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,920
Where is he?

754
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,840
He is gone in just a blink of an eye.

755
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,680
You are injured.

756
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Dr. Ling.

757
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,840
It's alright.

758
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,400
It's probably a scratch

759
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,640
left by a mad man.

760
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,840
I'll just apply some ointment.

761
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,360
Be careful.

762
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,490
It hurts!

763
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,160
It hurts so bad.

764
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,400
Can you help me?

765
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,850
Follow me.

766
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,960
Endure it.

767
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,680
It hurts.

768
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,770
I am disinfecting your wound.
Endure it for a while.

769
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,560
I have managed it.

770
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,330
If there is nothing else,

771
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,040
you can leave now.

772
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,040
Dr. Ling,

773
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,320
will you marry me?

774
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,930
What?

775
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
I mean

776
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,160
do you have a girlfriend?

777
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,400
This is my privacy.

778
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,720
I am afraid that I can't reveal it.

779
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,080
That means you don't have one.

780
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,760
That's strange.

781
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,800
You have a good look, a good body,

782
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,720
and mild temperament.

783
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,850
On top of that, you're a surgeon.

784
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,240
You should be quite popular.

785
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
If there's nothing else,

786
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,560
please leave.

787
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
I have to work. Thanks.

788
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,410
It doesn't matter. I'll find out.

789
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,180
Thanks, Ling Rui.

790
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,120
Dr. Ling.

791
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,880
Gao Erfan, look into Ling Rui's background.

792
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,320
Now.
