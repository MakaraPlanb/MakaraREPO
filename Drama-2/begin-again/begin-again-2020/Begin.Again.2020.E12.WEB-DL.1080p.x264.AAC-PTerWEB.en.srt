[Episode 12]

4
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,209
Ms. Lu,

5
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,489
are we just eating bread for dinner?

6
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,900
Yes.

7
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,330
Eat up.

8
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,170
Don't choke on the bread.

9
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,570
Thank you.

10
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,210
Ms. Lu,

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,820
would you like to eat something else?

12
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,650
Ms. Lu, you...

13
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,330
What's wrong?

14
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,340
Are these bread so delicious

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,020
that it moved you to tears?

16
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,090
It tastes normal.

17
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,810
Even this kind of bread tastes bad

18
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,810
when you eat too much of it.

19
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,450
How awful Ling Rui must felt

20
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,770
when he had to keep eating those bread?

21
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,650
Come on.

22
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,730
Don't stop, keep eating.

23
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,850
We have to choose

24
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,970
the best bread.

25
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,529
I'll buy it for Ling Rui

26
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,500
when he comes back

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,690
from his business trip.

28
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,820
You're trying to force Dr. Ling

29
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,010
to recall his past misery
to accentuate his current happiness?

30
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,610
How can that be?

31
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm replacing

32
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,860
his previous bad memories

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,940
with delightful flavors.

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,330
No, Ms. Lu.

35
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,370
In life,

36
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,140
there is countless great food.

37
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,380
Eating bread

38
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,810
is definitely not Dr. Ling's

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,490
dream.

40
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,779
You've gotten smarter.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,890
How can eating bread

42
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,370
be a person's

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,170
lifelong dream?

44
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,210
I'm going to write

45
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,690
a wealth plan that generates
a million yuan income a year.

46
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,700
Ms. Lu,

47
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,290
can you write one for me first?

48
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,420
That'd be too slow.

49
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,540
Shall I give him some shares?

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,490
My fortune?

51
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,210
I'll let Gao Erfan do some checking.

52
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,500
No, no.

53
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,380
If you do that to Dr. Ling,

54
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
he'll be scared.

55
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,340
Girl, you're naive.

56
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,330
I'm trying to give him

57
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,100
a strong sense of security.

58
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,610
Previously,

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,780
I always thought that.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,460
Ling Rui was a warm person.

61
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,810
But it turns out that

62
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,820
he had been through such painful days.

63
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,340
Ms. Lu,

64
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,330
are you sick?

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,810
What are you doing?

66
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,380
No, no.

67
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,970
I mean,

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,690
you love Dr. Ling so much.

69
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,490
Love?

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,140
Don't tell me that

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,650
you don't feel anything.

72
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,370
Ms. Lu,

73
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,210
do you know what you're doing?

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,770
I'm...

75
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm just...

76
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,930
taking care of

77
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,580
the father of my future baby.

78
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,930
Only when my baby's father is in a good mood,

79
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,770
can the baby

80
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,780
be in a good mood.

81
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,690
I'm considering it from

82
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,460
a genetic point of view.

83
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,250
Let me put it this way.

84
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,260
Even if you're lying to Dr. Ling that

85
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,450
you don't want a baby.

86
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,690
But what about then?

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,060
Having a baby

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,500
is not what Dr. Ling wants.

89
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,180
Will you force him?

90
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,330
Ms. Lu,

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,210
have you ever been in a relationship?

92
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,020
Don't tell me you have been single since birth?

93
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,500
What?

94
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,250
Single since birth? What do you mean?

95
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,220
It means that

96
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,410
you've never been in love

97
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,940
ever since you were born.

98
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,660
How is that possible?

99
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,380
Tell me about it.

100
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,460
How many times have you been in a relationship?

101
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,010
Or I wouldn't believe you.

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,260
This many?

103
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,050
One.

104
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,290
Strictly speaking, it's one point five.

105
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,970
Why is there a decimal point?

106
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,180
It's the kind of situation

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,859
where he thought he's in a relationship with me.

108
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,740
But I was actually taking him as a subject.

109
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,420
His family sells soy sauce.

110
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,210
Okay, okay, this doesn't count.

111
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,810
What about the remaining one?

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,220
That was a

113
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,260
serious relationship.

114
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Later on,

115
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,090
because of some reason,

116
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,250
we broke up,

117
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,730
I was even a little sad.

118
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,060
At that time,

119
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,650
he confessed his love to me

120
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,860
and gave me a box of chocolates.

121
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,100
I gave him a gift back.

122
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,930
What did you give him?

123
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,260
I don't know if you've bought one before.

124
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,410
Those stickers,

125
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,180
the puffy ones.

126
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,420
Not the normal kinds.

127
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,570
I remembered it was quite expensive.

128
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,610
Five yuan for one sticker sheet.

129
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,770
Did you buy one before?

130
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,900
I did.

131
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,210
How old were you?

132
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,580
Seven or eight.

133
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,370
I can't really remember.
It happened when I was in Grade 3.

134
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,890
That can't be counted as a relationship.

135
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,370
It doesn't count?

136
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,250
What is love then?

137
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,420
Love is when I...

138
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,609
He...

139
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,810
You're back.

140
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm cooking.

141
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,690
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

142
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,690
♫ Even the sky won't stop crying ♫

143
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,530
What's the matter?

144
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,609
You're really back?

145
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,970
How come you are back?

146
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,570
They were conducting air traffic control today.

147
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,660
The flight was canceled.

148
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,540
We had conference calls

149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,450
the whole day.

150
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,770
You are cooking.

151
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,010
I bought some vegetables

152
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,460
on my way back.

153
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,210
How's your day today?

154
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,050
How was work?

155
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,930
Pretty good.

156
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,570
We exchanged many new technologies

157
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,370
with specialists in pancreatic diseases.

158
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,540
I heard that in Germany,

159
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,130
they have new adjuvant therapies

160
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,650
and there have been successful cases.

161
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,490
I'm so glad.

162
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,170
Will you feel bored

163
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,330
if I talk about these?

164
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,490
No, I won't.

165
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,410
I like it.

166
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,490
What else did you do?

167
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,810
I had lunch with my colleagues.

168
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,370
In the afternoon,

169
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,020
we had a brief exchange.

170
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,730
Nothing else.

171
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,330
How about you?

172
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,530
I...

173
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,460
I was busy making money.

174
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,540
Nothing much.

175
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,730
You must be tired

176
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,810
after having a long day.

177
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,369
You don't have to cook.

178
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,369
Let's dine out.

179
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,140
It will be my treat.

180
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,780
Do you want Japanese or French cuisine?

181
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,690
Well...

182
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,340
If you don't like it,

183
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,020
you can treat me, too.

184
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm fine with whatever you like.

185
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,530
I like the feeling of

186
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,690
eating with my family.

187
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,940
I'd like to cook for them.

188
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,930
I won't get tired of that.

189
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,010
Well then, I like it too.

190
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,060
What's the matter with you today?

191
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,730
Why do you keep looking at me?

192
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,260
You cried?

193
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,730
No.

194
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,370
Probably because that

195
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,170
I haven't rested well these two days.

196
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,180
I suppose so.

197
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,060
No one would dare to bully you.

198
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,050
Except for you.

199
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,690
Nothing.

200
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,170
Ling Rui.

201
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,650
Today,

202
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,020
I really, really

203
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,340
want to hug you today.

204
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,860
Can I hug you?

205
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:12,980
Sure.

206
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,020
I have to get some ingredients.

207
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,370
Okay.

208
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,660
Fangning,

209
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,850
why are you acting

210
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,690
like a child today?

211
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,570
Come on.

212
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,530
I can't cook like this.

213
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,970
It's fine.

214
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,610
Go on.

215
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,890
Fangning, come on.

216
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,860
Come.

217
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,170
Here.

218
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,290
Stand still.

219
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,620
Stand against the wall.

220
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,050
Don't move.

221
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,850
What's wrong?

222
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,210
What are you doing?

223
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,180
What's wrong?

224
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,290
Put your back against it.

225
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,210
Don't let it fall off.

226
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,100
Hold these.

227
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,370
Grab tight.

228
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,690
Don't move.

229
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,050
Dinner will be ready soon.

230
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,530
Just wait a bit more.

231
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,930
Be good.

232
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,650
If... If you do this,

233
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,460
I can't move.

234
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,170
That's the point.

235
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,650
Or there's no way I can cook.

236
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,180
Well then...

237
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,170
What can be called as

238
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,610
love?

239
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,250
Love is when you care

240
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,300
if the person is happy or not.

241
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,770
All your emotions

242
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,010
are influenced by him.

243
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,770
Is he really not a fool?

244
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,290
I don't want to force him

245
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,250
to do what he doesn't want to.

246
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,500
You want to help him realize all his wishes.

247
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,570
You want to give him your most important things.

248
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,250
All of it.

249
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,450
Ling Rui,

250
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,450
I would like to officially inform you that

251
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,580
I want us

252
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,730
to start...

253
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,100
I'll open the door.

254
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,250
That's fine.

255
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,180
I'll go.

256
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,370
Who's that?

257
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,490
Who?

258
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,930
Lu Fangning,

259
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,730
you are just forcing him!

260
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,940
Tang Pingping,

261
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,580
why are you making a scene here at my house?

262
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,540
I didn't expect that

263
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,890
you would use their family debt

264
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,170
to force him to marry you.

265
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,780
I'm warning you.

266
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,050
Slander is also a crime.

267
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,300
I did not slander.

268
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,140
I found out about everything.

269
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,410
Your marriage with him

270
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,930
was fake from the beginning.

271
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,130
You're not saying anything?

272
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,170
You're admitting it?

273
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,930
Shut up.

274
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,300
You forced him with money.

275
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,290
You don't love him at all.

276
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,130
Who gives you the right

277
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,050
to speculate

278
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,050
my feelings?

279
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,820
Tang Pingping,

280
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,340
listen carefully.

281
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,970
How did Ling Rui and I meet

282
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,170
is none of your business.

283
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,540
Besides, I'm telling you.

284
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,130
My feelings for him are real.

285
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,010
As long as he's happy,

286
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,220
I'll be happy.

287
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
If he is not,

288
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,850
I'll try my best to make him happy.

289
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,010
I won't let him do anything

290
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,090
that he doesn't like.

291
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,810
On the contrary,

292
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,140
I will give him

293
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,250
my most precious things.

294
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,860
For the first time since I was a child,

295
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,970
I now understand

296
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,020
what it is like to truly love a person.

297
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,300
That's right.

298
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,050
Yes.

299
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,260
I love him.

300
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,290
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

301
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,130
♫ Listen to this carefully,
this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

302
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,460
I finally said it.

303
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,210
It feels so good.

304
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,370
Dr. Ling...

305
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,250
Ms. Tang,

306
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,740
Fangning and I have a happy marriage.

307
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,180
Thank you for your concern.

308
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,300
Sorry for hurting your eyes.

309
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,290
Are you satisfied now?

310
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,730
Now,

311
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,010
please...

312
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,090
get out of our house.

313
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,010
Your hand.

314
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,850
I hate you!

315
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,730
Close the door.

316
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,730
Darn it.

317
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,410
Lu Fangning,

318
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,690
just wait and see.

319
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,410
I will definitely

320
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,340
get Ling Rui back!

321
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,450
I won't lose to you.

322
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,490
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

323
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,330
It's cold.

324
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,820
How dare you chase me out?

325
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,770
One day,

326
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,140
it will be your turn, Lu Fangning!

327
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,620
Hmph!

328
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:48,810
Hmph!

329
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,010
You...

330
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,730
don't hate vegetables anymore?

331
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,570
I'll buy more vegetables tomorrow.

332
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,500
No.

333
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,930
Anything is fine.

334
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,970
I'm fine with anything.

335
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,450
Ling Rui,

336
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,260
don't you...

337
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,250
have anything to say?

338
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,180
Like what?

339
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,450
About my confession

340
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,650
to you tonight,

341
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,540
don't you have anything to say?

342
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,140
Isn't that

343
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,380
an excuse

344
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,330
to make Tang Ping give up?

345
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,570
I have thousands of other reasons

346
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,740
to make her give up.

347
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,260
Why would I bother to say all those things?

348
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,890
Perhaps

349
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,570
that is the most convenient one.

350
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,580
Ling Rui, look at me.

351
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,819
Look at me.

352
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,100
In all seriousness,

353
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,450
I'll tell you once again.

354
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:25,569
I love you.

355
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,410
You've said that many times.

356
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,019
This time...

357
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,660
I really love you.

358
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,730
I mean it. It's true.

359
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,330
No,

360
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,290
you were just being impulsive

361
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,700
to upset Tang Ping.

362
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,180
I don't know

363
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,170
what happened to you today.

364
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,050
But love

365
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,330
is not something so casual.

366
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,250
I'm full. I'll go back to my room.

367
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,850
Tell me when you're done.

368
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,250
I'll clean up.

369
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,410
You are so stupid.

370
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,460
Who wants to have a baby with you?

371
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,090
You get what you deserve.

372
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,690
This time,

373
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,370
I really love you.

374
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,100
I mean it.

375
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,250
It's true.

376
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,590
[The CEO's Sweetheart]

377
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,460
I've tried everything.

378
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,930
What do you want me to do?

379
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,970
Ling Rui,

380
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,010
I love you.

381
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,690
Ling Rui,

382
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,570
I love you.

383
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,650
Ling Rui works in the hospital every day.

384
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,250
I think he's probably

385
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,370
fed up with a white coat.

386
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,300
No.

387
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,570
This is good.

388
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,410
I'm not wearing anything under this.

389
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,290
It looks sexy.

390
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,930
Ling Rui.

391
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,770
No.

392
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,290
It will bring back

393
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,420
all the bad memories to him.

394
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,660
Why?

395
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,330
Why do I have to dress up like this?

396
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,410
[Even if she said she was not being impulsive]

397
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,770
[or because she wanted to win,]

398
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,610
[but it's because]

399
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,260
[everything feels new when she's with me.]

400
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,290
[It will fade away soon.]

401
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,130
The wealth plan that generates
a million yuan income a year?

402
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,330
Half of your fortune?

403
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,730
All of your fortune?

404
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,340
Aren't you the one

405
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,930
who suggested them, Ms. Lu?

406
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,260
It worked before.

407
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,650
How come it doesn't now?

408
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,090
That's right.

409
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,250
It worked before.

410
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,850
How come it doesn't now?

411
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,370
Did you get rejected

412
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,250
by Dr. Ling?

413
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,290
I mean...

414
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,860
Ms. Lu, your love for Dr. Ling

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,250
has gotten deeper.

416
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,890
The more you care about him,

417
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,700
the more insecure you feel.

418
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,450
Insecure...

419
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,140
I never thought that one day,

420
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,130
this word

421
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,500
will be related to me.

422
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,770
You know what?

423
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,660
Even if I gave Ling Rui

424
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,410
the wealth plan

425
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,730
and all my fortune,

426
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,770
Ling Rui won't accept it.

427
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,460
Why?

428
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,850
He has such a great personality.

429
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,650
His job is to heal the wounded
and rescue the dying.

430
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,570
After he gets off work,

431
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,050
he continues to do that.

432
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,380
He saves more people

433
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,290
and treats more wounds.

434
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,370
More importantly, it's for free.

435
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,450
So,

436
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,890
compared with Ling Rui,

437
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,450
I'm nothing.

438
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,340
From now on,

439
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,780
I want to be like him.

440
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,730
Be a warm person,

441
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,140
a noble person,

442
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,690
a perfect match for him.

443
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,410
A woman who really matches him.

444
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,090
I want to be

445
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,530
an angel.

446
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,780
Ms. Lu,

447
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,890
you are an angel.

448
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,690
Do you lack money?

449
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,130
Do you want the watch?

450
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,060
I see you haven't

451
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,770
had a watch.

452
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,010
-This watch is expensive.
-No, Ms. Lu.

453
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:16,900
Dad.

454
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,100
Come on.

455
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,730
Daddy.

456
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,020
How much do you want?

457
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,020
80,000 yuan?

458
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,050
No.

459
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,370
8,000 yuan? No problem.

460
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,460
No.

461
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,530
IOU.

462
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,730
I, Tang Ping will borrow four million yuan

463
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,450
from my father, Tang Dawei.

464
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,450
I will definitely pay off the debt.

465
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,650
Debit holder, Tang Ping.

466
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,100
Right.

467
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,290
Pingping.

468
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,340
Tell me honestly.

469
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,530
Did you do something

470
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,730
very bad?

471
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,850
I didn't break the law.

472
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,730
That's right.

473
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,970
You are not capable of doing that.

474
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,690
But,

475
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,170
you're not that capable,

476
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,530
someone else can be.

477
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,690
Tell me the truth.

478
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,100
Did someone deceive you?

479
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,540
Did they brainwash you?

480
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,660
No.

481
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,690
What are you talking about?

482
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,250
Are you lending me or not?

483
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,650
If you are not, I'll go to uncle Lu.

484
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,020
You didn't break the law?

485
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,890
No.

486
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,770
You must have been deceived then.

487
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,050
I told you earlier

488
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,970
that you're not clever.

489
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,100
You don't believe me.

490
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,450
Did some jerk

491
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,620
ask you for four million yuan?

492
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,570
Is it?

493
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,250
Jerk?

494
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,780
Yes.

495
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,730
Tell me, what kind of man

496
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,850
would simply ask a girl

497
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,250
for four million yuan?

498
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,770
Doesn't that make him a jerk?

499
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,140
Lu Fangning gave Dr. Ling

500
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,050
four million yuan.

501
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,370
That makes Dr. Ling a jerk?

502
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,650
If I told Uncle Lu

503
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,930
and everyone the truth,

504
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,690
they will think that

505
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,970
Dr. Ling is a jerk.

506
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,090
I can't say anything.

507
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,410
Are you lending me or not?

508
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,850
No.

509
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,010
Are you lending me or not?

510
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,620
No!

511
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,050
Yes or no?

512
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,690
Where is that jerk?

513
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,490
Ask him to come here.

514
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,610
I'll give it to him.

515
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,610
I'll give him four hundred slaps!

516
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,130
There's no one like that, no!

517
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,380
It's not like that!

518
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,290
What is it then?

519
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,100
I want to get plastic surgery!

520
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,330
To look like Lu Fangning.

521
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,420
All right?

522
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,530
Plastic surgery?

523
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,930
To look like Lu Fangning?

524
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,860
Any amount of money will do.

525
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,970
You are giving the goods to me now?

526
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,650
Can I resell it?

527
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,330
I need money urgently, you know.

528
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,900
I just want to resell the goods.

529
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,970
Can I do that?

530
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,220
I have to go now.

531
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,450
Dr. Ling.

532
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,170
Ms. Tang.

533
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,420
About what happened last night,

534
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,330
I hope...

535
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't worry.

536
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,970
I won't tell anyone.

537
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,050
For your reputation.

538
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,090
For your fame

539
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,100
and your future.

540
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,810
I won't say anything.

541
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,490
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

542
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,130
For letting me and Fangning

543
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,050
take care of our personal affairs.

544
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,330
From now on,

545
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,660
let's get down to business.

546
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,300
Dr. Ling,

547
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,780
I know your present situation.

548
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,570
You can't be with me.

549
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,410
Not to mention...

550
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,250
you can't even

551
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,570
show your true feelings.

552
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,050
But you'll be able to do it after a year.

553
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,250
A year later,

554
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,860
you'll divorce Lu Fangning.

555
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,610
By that time,

556
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,530
I'll be the first candidate

557
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,810
to be your girlfriend.

558
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,770
Ms. Tang.

559
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,890
All right, I know.

560
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,980
You don't have to

561
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,860
promise me anything now.

562
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,650
I'll be waiting for you.

563
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,890
Because...

564
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,330
I

565
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,570
love

566
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,290
you.

567
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,690
I

568
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,660
love

569
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,570
you.

570
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,090
Ms. Tang,

571
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,900
you don't have to wait for me.

572
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,850
Neither will we, in the future,

573
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,090
have any kind of relationship.

574
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,650
Of course, you would want your father

575
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,780
to be healthy.

576
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,890
So,

577
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,010

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,020
In the end, just remember

769
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,090
to tell Ling Rui that

770
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,450
I did these all on purpose.

771
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,050
The purpose is

772
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,530
to raise more money

773
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,100
for the kids in this hospital.

774
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,090
She's trying to fight with me.

775
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,660
I'll let her have it.

776
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,140
Congratulations, this gentleman.

781
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,609

All right.

So the third painting...

796
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:41,410
Is this what you mean?

797
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,169
Right.

798
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,730
Is right here.

799
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,930
This painting

800
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,100
was created by

801
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,740
an 8-year-old kid.

Congratulations to this beautiful young lady.

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,629
As for the next painting,

806
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:52,510
it's interesting.

807
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,859
Van Gogh's sunflowers.

808
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:54,320
4,000.

809
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,240
6,000.

00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,960
Deal!

811
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,260
Okay, the following one.

00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,350
This painting

813
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,530
was created by a 6-year-old kid.

814
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,330

00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:02,470

She got another painting.

821
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,560
Beautiful young lady...

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,970
All right, the next painting.

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,870
the last painting of this auction.

825
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,050
The creator of this painting

826
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,100
is Xinbao.

827
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,150
He's also here with us.

828
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,740
Let's give him a round of applause, all right?

829
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,680
Well done!

830
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,850
Okay, Xinbao.

831
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,070
About this painting,

832
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,120
I'd like to ask

833
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,090
what is the title of this painting?

834
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,240
It's

835
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,200
My

836
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,460
Dear

837
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,970
Dr. Ling.

838
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,430
An angel.

839
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,790
Holy light.

840
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,560
Ling Rui.

841
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,840
Get this painting for me.

842
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,640
Xinbao.

843
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,770
How much are you going to start

844
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,860
for this painting?

845
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,670

846
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,600
All right. Staring bid, 100 yuan.

00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,540

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,760

851
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,940
8,000 yuan.

852
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,320
-The young lady offered 8,000 yuan.
-Double it.

853
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,580
16,000.

854
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,250
16,000.

855
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,640
Are you happy now, Xinbao?

856
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,150
20,000.

857
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,460
Stop competing with me.

858
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,260
Fangning, what should I do?

859
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,640
50,000.

860
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,230
I...

861
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,520
I said 50,000.

862
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,880
60,000.

863
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,840
80,000.

864
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,190
100,000.

865
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,030
200,000.

866
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,030
500,000!

867
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,130
Stop, stop!

868
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,550
Can you both give it a rest?

869
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,860
I can draw one for you, my sister-in-law.

870
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,070
Let me draw one for you.

871
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,040
I'll draw one for you, too.

872
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,880
How's that?

873
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,690
I'm sure all of you can feel

874
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,210
their generosity.

875
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,550
Xinbao, do you feel it?

876
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,940
Yes.

877
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,240
Right. Of course,

878
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,540
the way we show love

879
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,970
may not just through

880
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,190
this auction.

881
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,870
I'm sure there will be

882
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,620
other ways

883
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,670
and opportunities

884
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,640
waiting for both of you.

885
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,600
You're right.

886
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,780
Therefore,

887
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,830
I hereby announce that

888
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,930
I've decided to fund

889
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,980
one-year medical expenses

890
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,580
for ten poor children

891
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,960
in this hospital.

892
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,540
I'll fund 20 children!

893
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,510
30 children.

894
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,120
Dr. Ling.

895
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,710
Xinbao.

896
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,270
I would like to have this painting, too.

897
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,370
But...

898
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,380
I only have 2,000 yuan.

899
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,560
Can I have it?

900
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,310
Xinbao,

901
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,030
what is your decision?

902
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,930
Okay.

903
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,820
I drew a portrait of Dr. Ling.

904
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,800
So I'll sell it to Dr. Ling.

905
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,120
2,000 yuan, deal. Congratulations!

906
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,010
Now, let's have

907
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,270
all the successful bidders

908
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,700
come up on stage for a group photo.

909
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,400
Why do we have this session?

910
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,800
What's wrong with this session?

911
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,980
Don't worry, my sister-in-law.

912
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,320
Don't worry.

913
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,830
I'll make sure to tell everything

914
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,670
to Ling Rui.

915
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,630
Okay, let's give them a big hand.

916
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,380
Listen.

917
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,350
I can paint, too. I sell it for 500 yuan.

918
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,570
I'll give you 1,000 yuan to shut up.

919
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,540
Bye, Dr. Ling.

920
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,560
Fangning.

921
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,870
Bye.

922
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,720
It's okay.

923
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,870
I'll get back to work.

924
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,630
You should go as well.

925
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,940
Ling Rui, actually I...

926
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,030
I'm very busy.

927
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,250
Let's talk about it when we're at home.

928
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,980
No, we'll talk about it next time.

929
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,460
That's it.

930
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,170
I'm returning to my ward.

931
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,770
That's it?

932
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,360
Forget it, okay?

933
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,290
Why?

934
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,070
Because I don't like it.

935
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,660
I don't like that

936
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,050
you could say those three words so easily.

937
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,480
I don't like that you are competing

938
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,780
over such things.

939
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,750
So let's just drop it, okay?

940
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,220
Why would you think so?

941
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,940
Who told you that?

942
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,070
Who told you I was being insincere?

943
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,040
Tang Ping?

944
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,050
Why did you choose to believe her

945
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,720
but not me?

946
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,150
I don't believe her.

947
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,080
I believe what I know about you.

948
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,880
Who are you

949
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,090
to judge me?

950
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,820
I've never done that

951
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,030
to anyone else.

952
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,380
I was not acting recklessly

953
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,550
or competing with anyone.

954
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,810
What can I do

955
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,240
to make you believe me?

956
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,420
Should I sponsor more patients for your sake?

957
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,760
Is that okay?

958
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,370
I'm... I'm sorry.

959
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,270
Did I say something wrong again?

960
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,010
Ling Rui,

961
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,190
I did all of these

962
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,370
because I want to

963
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,500
get closer to you.

964
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,730
I hope you can truly

965
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,610
fall in love with me.

966
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,000
I admit what I did to you before

967
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,800
was on the spur of the moment.

968
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,530
But when these spontaneous moments

969
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,080
come together,

970
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,560
it then becomes an indisputable fact that

971
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,920
I love...

972
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,850
Believe me.

973
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,910
When you're no longer impulsive

974
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,710
and competitive,

975
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,220
you won't feel the same anymore.

976
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,100
Don't say anything

977
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,360
that you're not sure of.

978
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,380
That's all I'm going to say.

979
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm leaving.

980
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,170
Our brand

981
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,770
is the leading brand
in the home furnishing industry.

982
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,900
We have the ability to

983
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,580
lead the main trends of the market.

984
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,770
Compared to our brand,

985
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,400
our competitors use crude materials

986
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,410
and apply irrational structures.

987
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,290
In contrast,

988
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,010
Infinity

989
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,480
is the lightest and strongest.

990
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,960
Adjourn.

991
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,970
That's it for my love life?

992
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,540
It wilted before it even started.

993
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,150
Where's my next episode?

994
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,050
Where is the next episode?

995
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,480
The next episode is coming.

996
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,160
Director Lu.

997
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,570
Lin Qi.

998
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,250
Director Lu.

999
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,460
Siyu.

1000
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,620
Siyu.

1001
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,180
You've got something to say?

1002
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,890
Carry on with your work then.

1003
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:11,990
Go on.

1004
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,580
The proposal that you just gave me

1005
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,710
is not like what you said.

1006
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,390
Have a look at it.

1007
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,530
Sure, I'll check it.

1008
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,590
I'll hand it to you in a while.

1009
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,760
Yes, please do.

1010
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:28,920
I'm sorry.
