Throughout all these years,

she has always insisted on
founding Infinity.

21

Okay, go on.

Was that a criticism?

200
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,280
I was threatening you.

201
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
And,

202
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,810
you always put ads

203
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,880
on our entertainment section.

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,680
Who says the effect would be better

205
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
with more views?

206
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,240
Celebrity gossip is so interesting.

207
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,130
Who will have the time

208
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,480
to see a mattress ad
overlapped on a celebrity's face?

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,170
Even if I click it by accident,

210
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,690
and the official page
of your company pops up.

211
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,400
Where are the products?

212

Where should I find it?

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,850
Reading gossips is more fun.

it's much better than

your present job.

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,880
As for the secret,

234
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,320
you have to

235
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,160
erase that

236
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,280
from your brain.

358
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,570
to receive a radical treatment

359
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,470
through surgery.

We can't make judgments now.

362
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,200
But if it's spleen lesions,

363
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,990
he should get diagnosed

364
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,280
and receive treatment as soon as possible.

365
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,290
I'll take your advice.
We'll do the surgery.

366
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,400
Okay.

367
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,960
I'll make you an admission notice.

368
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,320

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,170
are you still willing

370
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,000
to do the surgery for my father?

371
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,000
Of course.

372
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
He is the patient. I'm a doctor.

373
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,120
It's my job to save a patient's life.

374
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,200
Alright, you've got
the patient ID card, right?

375
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,400
Go pay the fees.

376
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,040
How much should I give you

377
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,170
personally?

378
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Are you a fool?

379
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,010
How could you say this in front of me?

380

Go pay the fees.

385
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,680
Good for you.

386
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,960
Separate work from private interests.

387
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,930
Nice.

388
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,040
[Send to: Ling Rui]

389
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,050
Will you

390
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,280
come back tonight?

391
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,400
The condition of the patient at bed 22

392
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,600
is quite special.

393
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
His liver is normal

394
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,290
in size and shape.

395
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
But you see, it has a smooth
and neat contour,

396
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,920
as well as a clear membrane.

397
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,360
So be sure to observe closely

398
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,010
and pay attention to his temperature.

399
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Keep an eye on him.

400
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
Dr. Peng, who is this woman?

401
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,760
She seems to have an unusual relationship

402
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,040
with Director Ling?

403
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,280
Another crazy fan of him.

404
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,410
Haven't you got used to this?

405
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
How many fans does he have?

406
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,080
This is not the same.

407
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040
How?

408
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,120
She is

409
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,040
more stubborn,

410
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,330
and may directly affect

411
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,170
our director.

412
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
Affect our director?

413
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
They have a personal relationship?

414
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,090
Anyway,

415
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,920
this is

416
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,280
where we work, right?

417
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,800
Don't let others pry into

418
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,600
our Director Ling's

419
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,210
personal life,

420
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:35,960
got it?

421
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,000
I got it.

422
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,480
Fangyu,

423
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,040
why are you playing with your phone again?

424
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,770
Your mom said that

425
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,810
you got this sickness

426
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,650
because you played with your phone
too much.

427
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,650
-Dad.
-You're can't be cured.

428
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,170
Dad, I'm not sick at all.

429
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,010
What are you talking about?

430
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,400
I won't ask you.

431
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
You won't tell me the truth.

432
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,410
I won't ask you.

433
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,960
I'll ask Ling Rui.

434
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,290
I felt like there is someone absent.

435
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,090
Where is Ling Rui?

436
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Fangning, where is Ling Rui?

437
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,280
I have to say something.

438
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,250
Did you have a fight

439
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,000
with Ling Rui again?

440
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,040
Listen,

441
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,720
you can't do that.

442
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
You're now

443
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
married.

444
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,770
If you go on acting like this,

445
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,880
no matter how good a man he is,

446
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,560
your life would go wrong one day.

447
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,240
Ling Rui is such a good man.

448
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,290
He is a doctor.

449
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,570
Right?

450
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,520
Brother-in-law.

451
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,690
Dad,

452
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,890
you're looking for me?

453
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,410
You're at home?

454
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,920
I just got back.

455
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,880
Fangning said
you wouldn't come back tonight.

456
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,880
I wasn't going to come back.

457
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,450
But temporarily decided
to pick up some clothes.

458
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm leaving again later.

459
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,530
Have dinner first.

460
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,810
I really can't.

461
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,290
I still got work in the hospital.

462
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,640
Dad, I'll go talk to Fangning.

463
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,600
Take your meals regularly.

464
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,610
After I'm done with the work,

465
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,840
I'll make it up to you.

466
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,950
Okay.

467
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,560
Dad, aunt, enjoy the meal.

468
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,650
I'm leaving.

469
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,670
Okay.

470
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,890
Ling Rui,

471
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,240
don't miss your meals no matter
how busy you are.

472
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,200
Also, come back early.

473
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Okay.

474
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,840
Go ahead.

475
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,470
[Nurse Station]

476
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,520
Um...

477
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,480
Nice contact lenses.

478
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,600
I am not wearing contact lenses.

479
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,680
Then you really have beautiful eyes.

480
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,040
You are?

481
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,170
I'm...

482
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,040
Patient's family member.

483
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,360
Are you here to see Director Ling?

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,730
Yes.

485
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,040
No, no.

486
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,160
What Director Ling?

487
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,960
Look, these are

488
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,200
food I bought

489
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
for the doctors and nurses.

490
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

491
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,010
You're welcome.

492
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,730
Alright, I see.

493
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
No one is allowed to eat this.

494
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
Let me see.

495
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,800
Wow.

496
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
Yang Jin, you freak.

497
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
How can you fight with us

498
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,130
for this heart-shaped cake?

499
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,970
That's right.

500
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,320
This is for Director Ling.

501
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,400
Be smart.

502
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,400
Freak.

503
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,240
He didn't answer my message,

504
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,210
but came back all of a sudden.

505
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,520
He came back,

506
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,680
but didn't stay the night.

507
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,360
Guidelines of a happy marriage?

508
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,080
But, where is my husband!

509
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,680
Sister,

510
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,760
I heard nothing just now.

511
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,800
Did you knock at the door?

512
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,640
Come in.

513
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,610
Your hearing is good.

514
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,840
Why don't you quit the job in the mall

515
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,770
and be a telephone operator?

516
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,010
Sister, I think my job is good.

517
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,440
I don't want to be an operator.

518
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,200
By the way,

519
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,410
I just called

520
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,200
the hospital.

521
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,040
Actually,

522
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
brother-in-law isn't on duty tonight.

523
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
I think he just said that because

524
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,960
he didn't want to

525
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,890
make things awkward for you.

526
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
It was his fault anyway.

527
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,930
Sister.

528
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
Why don't you be proactive this time?

529
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,890
I heard from brother-in-law

530
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,930
that there is a nice restaurant

531
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,560
nearby the hospital.

532
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,200
Why don't you

533
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,770
deliver the food there in person

534
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,920
to impress him?

535
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,190
Sister,

536
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,080
I'm also a man.

537
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,400
I know what men like.

538
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,120
Lu Fangyu,

539
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,230
I can let you

540
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,920
get out right now,

541
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,710
you know?

542
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,600
-I know, I know.
-Get out.

543
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,440
Now.

544
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,960
Get out!

545
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,280
Okay, as you wish.

546
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,410
Sister, I'm your brother.

547
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,560
I'll definitely help you!

548
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,570
Get lost!

549
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,640
A man who said

550
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
he would obey the contract

551
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,910
hasn't come home
for two days in a row.

552
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,360
Should I stay at home,

553
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,730
waiting for him to break the contract?

554
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,720
Of course, no.

555
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,070
I have the duty to

556
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
remind him

557
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,170
and help him.

558
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Tang Ping?

559
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,040
Why are you here?

560
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,570
Dr. Ling

561
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,250
specially arranged the surgery

562
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,840
for my father right away

563
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,210
after he heard that my father was sick.

564
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,560
And, he stressed that

565
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,170
he'd do it personally.

566
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,170
He knew that

567
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,610
I don't like being around

568
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,840
too many people.

569
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,040
So,

570
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,080
he arranged

571
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
a single ward for my father.

572
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,810
So sweet.

573
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,410
What are you doing?

574
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,370
This is a hospital.

575
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,720
Behave yourself.

576
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Listen, Tang Pingping.

577
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,210
Our Ling Rui is a doctor

578
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,330
who is considerate and responsible.

579
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,240
It's his duty

580
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,810
to take care of his patients

581
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,200
and their families.

582
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,040
That's nothing.

583
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,880
Single ward?

584
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,040
Let alone Ling Rui,

585
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,720
even Uncle Tang won't request that.

586
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,490
But you are quite good at

587
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,560
wasting national resources

588
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,760
without contributing.

589
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,120
-You...
-Alright.

590
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,130
Since I'm here,

591
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,280
just bring me to visit Uncle Tang.

592
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,570
No, let go of me!

593
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
Didn't you hear from them?

594
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,040
Both the man and the woman
are not married.

595
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,480
People in this hospital

596
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,280
don't know

597
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,050
he's married.

598
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,240
You say,

599
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,720
why didn't he tell others?

600
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,650
He doesn't want any trouble
when you get a divorce later, right?

601
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,530
Dr. Yang.

602
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,480
Tell her who I am.

603
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,200
The family member
of the patient of bed 2.

604
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,970
Be more specific.

605
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,010
A special family member of Director Ling.

606
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,520
Fangning, why are you here?

607
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,450
Sure enough, he isn't wearing the ring.

608
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
One-year term.

609
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,800
You remember that very clearly.

610
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,850
What do you mean?

611
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,360
You always say

612
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,280
that you will

613
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
obey the contract.

614
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,320
You accepted

615
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,050
another woman's cake

616
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,090
and be kind to another woman.

617
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,410
Is this how you

618
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,250
obey the contract?

619
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,000
Fangning,

620
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
can we have a talk calmly?

621
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
Am I talking to the air

622
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,600
right now?

623
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,600
Do you know that

624
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,240
when I'm alone at home,

625
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,920
all the people asked me

626
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
where you went

627
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,200
and when would you come back?

628
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,290
What can I tell them?

629
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,080
How come a newlywed husband

630
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,810
gets tied up

631
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,880
and can't come home?

632
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,290
I'm just worried that

633
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,330
we would be caught in a lie.

634
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,320
What about today?

635
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,890
I told everyone

636
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,530
you wouldn't come back,

637
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,480
and you showed up suddenly,

638
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,640
that embarrassed me.

639
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,250
Do you know that?

640
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,930
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

641
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
It's my fault.

642
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,450
That's all?

643
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,040
Ling Rui, let me ask you.

644
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,760
At the present time, do you ever

645
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,840
keep it in mind that

646
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,000
you're already married?

647
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,560
Do I have to?

648
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,360
Of course!

649
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,960
Newlyweds don't just say that

650
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,040
they love each other

651
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,280
and hold hands!

652
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,010
Look at us,

653
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,720
we don't look like

654
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,560
a newlywed couple at all!

655
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm telling you,

656
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,240
if our lies are exposed,

657
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,010
it's your fault.
You're breaking the contract!

658
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,840
My fault?

659
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,600
I can finally work in

660
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,640
a splendid office building.

661
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,640
They are really elites,

662
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,720
looking so fancy.

663
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,800
But why should I

664
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,360
dress like this for work?

665
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,600
My feet ache.

666
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Cai Siyu, you can do this.

667
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,960
Come on.

668
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,240
I'm coming.

669
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,160
There, falling, careful.

670
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,040
Good luck.

671
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,640
Missy,

672
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,400
are you from the "rookie village"?

673
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,040
You are not proficient
in your "equipment".

674
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,210
Mind your mouth, okay?

675
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
Don't hit on me.

676
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,490
I didn't.

677
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
Let me help you?

678
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,600
No need.

679
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,080
We're colleagues, let me help you.

680
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,240
Don't touch me.

681
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,170
Don't touch me!

682
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,610
-You...
-Shut up.

683
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,280
Director Lu.

684
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm sorry.

685
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,400
You saw that.

686
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,770
She pushed me.

687
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,120
-She pushed me.
-Director Lu?

688
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,600
What are you talking about?

689
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,040
Why would I push you
if you didn't touch me?

690
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,280
I meant well.

691
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,360
Director Lu, I'm sorry.

692
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,440
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,560
Well... I'll go bring the cleaner over.

694
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,640
You!

695
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,760
Cai Siyu?

696
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,360
Director Lu.

697
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,830
Why are they together?

698
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,280
Cai Siyu.

699
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,190
What are you doing?

700
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,200
Why are you two together?

701
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,040
Oh my.

702
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,890
Did Ms. Lu misunderstand?

703
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,070
Simon.

704
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,750
-What's wrong with you?
-Ms. Lu, I...

705
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,440
I didn't do that.

706
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,650
Alright. Quit it.

707
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,330
You embarrassed the director
on your first day.

708
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,400
No bonus this month.

709
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,760
Let's go, Simon.

710
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,090
Go get it changed.

711
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,879
Tissue.

712
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,930
Ms. Lu...

713
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,879
I had my bonus canceled on my first day,

714
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,530
what should I do next?

715
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,520
Cai Siyu,

716
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,070
do you know why

717
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,250
I asked you to stay?

718
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,520
I don't really know.

719
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,570
The employee was sent by Ms. Lu.

720
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,149
How come it's you,

721
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:01,399
a rookie?

722
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,649
You dared spill coffee

723
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:04,649
all over Director Lu

724
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:05,530
on your first day at work?

725
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,920
No, I didn't do that.

726
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,360
You didn't, then I did?

727
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,840
How dare you slander me!

728
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,730
I did that, I did.

729
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,480
Stand up.

730
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,680
Have a seat.

731
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,080
You have a good attitude.

732
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll just let you go.

733
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Anyway, you'll be in

734
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,330
my Planning Department.

735
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,480
I'll back you in the future.

736
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you so much.

737
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,330
Hold on.

738
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,200
My last name is Lin. I'm Lin Qi.

739
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,600
You can call me

740
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,470
Leader Lin.

741
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,040
Hello, Leader Lin.

742
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,410
You can come to me

743
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,760
if you have any problem

744
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
about the company

745
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,280
in the future.

746
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,400
But,

747
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,080
you may not have the chance to do that.

748
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,200
You just pissed Director Lu off.

749
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,610
I assume you will not stay here
for a long time.

750
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,600
Is Director Lu

751
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,110
terrifying?

752
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,600
Terrifying?

753
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,370
More than that.

754
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,440
He is a legend, okay?

755
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,770
Legend?

756
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah.

757
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,530
What legend?

758
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,600
First,

759
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,120
there are two subordinates

760
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,000
who've worked with him for over a decade.

761
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,680
They've been sticking by him

762
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,730
no matter at home or abroad.

763
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,280
A leader's glamor.

764
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,440
He must be broad-minded then?

765
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,570
Not necessarily.

766
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,930
Second, although his last name is Lu,

767
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
he is not

768
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,890
relevant to the Lu Family.

769
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,120
He was adopted by Chairman Lu.

770
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,030
But he has helped our chairman,

771
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,200
and done many things that

772
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,330
our chairman wanted to do

773
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,410
but dared not do.

774
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,160
The mystery of his lot,
complicated and mysterious.

775
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,080
Exactly the standards of a male lead.

776
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
What else?

777
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Just listen to me.

778
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,800
Third,

779
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,170
ten years ago,

780
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,600
he suddenly broke up

781
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,240
with his fiance

782
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,570
who was about to marry him.

783
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,760
No one knew what happened

784
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
and why.

785
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,600
Later,

786
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,610
Lu Yiyao went to Sweden for ten years

787
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,370
and never came back.

788
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,770
He was

789
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,330
traveling the world for love.

790
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,090
A rare love fool.

791
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,680
Anything else?

792
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,510
No more?

793
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,880
Except for the two subordinates
and the fiance,

794
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,450
no more juicy gossips

795
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,970
about Director Lu?

796
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,720
What's wrong with your eyes?

797
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,320
Well, Director Lu, I...

798
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,600
You're fooling me again.

799
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,960
Well done.

800
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,970
Come on.

801
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,490
What else do you want to know?

802
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,880
I can tell you in person.
