Shouldn't he stop me by now?

5
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,150
Why doesn't he stop me?

6
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,739
Come on!

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,590
All right.

Really?

9
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,270
This is really happening.

10
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,860

You're back.

22
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,620
I've thought about it,

23
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,029
and I think I need to

24
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:54,270
express my gratitude to you.

25
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,710
Thank you.

26
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,740
Thank me?

27
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,029
The issue with the material

28
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,380
has been resolved.

29
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,550
Qin Yujiang helped me with this.

30
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,029
And I also know that

31
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,380
you met her

32
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,260
at the factory.

33
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,470
Actually,

34
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,150
I didn't help much.

35
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,100
Ms. Qin figured it out on her own.

36
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,510
I figured it out too.

37
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,830
I criticized her

38
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,910
and said that she

39
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,830
lost her principles for love.

40
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,310
But it turned out that

41
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,590
I did the same.

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,950
Ling Rui.

43
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Before this,

44
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,060
I've been so bossy and selfish.

45
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,220
You were right.

46
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,270
When a person lies too many times,

47
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,950
she will start to believe them herself.

48
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,870
That gave you

49
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,070
a lot of burdens, right?

50
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,790
I'm tired.

51
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,740
I won't do this anymore.

52
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm going to sort

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,660
everything out.

54
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,550
And I'm not going to let you

55
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,380
feel uncomfortable ever again.

56
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,790
I hope that

57
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,140
you won't think of me as

58
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,859
a terrible person.

59
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,230
That's it.

60
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,310
Goodnight.

from now on.

63

Is she coming out for breakfast?

64
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,300
Good morning.

65
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,910
Morning.

66
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,060
I made breakfast.

67
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
Would you like some?

68
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,390
I'll just have coffee in the morning.

69
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,260
You made for two?

70
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,500
Then I'll eat it.

71
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,070
Okay.

72
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:00,740
It tastes good.

73
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,910

You are welcome.

75
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,140
By the way,

76
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,540
I'll transfer the living expenses

77
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,980
to you on time.

78
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,260
Living expenses?

79
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,630
Didn't you say that

80
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,710
we should share

81
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,100
the cost of living?

82
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,710
I've thought about it.
I'm not good at

83
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,990
casting accounts.

84
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,270
You're better at it.

85
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,540
It's better for both of us

86
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,020
to divide the costs.

87
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,940
I don't have a good appetite in the morning.

88
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,780
I'm done.

89
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,910
I'll go to work now.

90

Where are you going?

91
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,859
Well, I mean

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,430
it's not even time

93
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,380
for work, isn't it?

94
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,300
I have an early meeting. Bye.

95
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,060

I'll clean the place up then.

Once we have a decision on that,

106
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,619
it's going to be announced

107

115
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,580
Just probably a little expensive.

17 or 18 endorsements.

Seeing this face

119
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,700
reminds me of shampoo,

120
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
skin cream, burgers, fried chicken,

121
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,950

but his last endorsement was

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,750
golden thermal underwear.

126
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,030

It looks red.

Don't worry.

136
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,190
It's a minor injury.

Gathering information to find

All right.

151
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,820
I'll talk to the marketing department

152

to get in touch with him.

153
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Actually, I think that

154
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,260
for these new stars in development,

155
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,190
their prices

156
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,670

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,860
are basically the same.

158
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,340
It's not enough to just look at the numbers.

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,870
We have to meet him in person.

160
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100

I know you two are close.

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,470
I...

187
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,900
I just thought...

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,030
I just didn't expect that

189
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,540

Why are you wearing a ring?

357
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,510
A doctor won't do something like this.

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,500
No offense.

359
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,020
It's just that I think surgeons

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,350
have a lot of surgeries,

361
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,030
so it's very inconvenient to wear a ring.

362
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,190
And it's not a hospital here,

363
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,700
why should you wear a white coat?

364
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,710
Afraid that anyone could not tell

365
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,710
that you're a doctor?

366
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,030
It feels a little intentional.

367
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,750
Pardon me.

371
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,430
I mean, it was so good that

372
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,750
I almost cried.

373
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,790
You bet, he's very good.

374
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,990
Thanks for the suggestions, Ms. Lu.

375
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,070
Ms. Lu seems to know surgeons

376
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,300
very well.

377
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,870

379
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,510
Do I?

380
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,060
I guess so.

381
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
But for surgeons,

382
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,220
their hands are important.

383
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,750
How about this?

384
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,790
Let me take a look at your hand.

385
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,860
Ms. Lu, well.

386
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,750
You haven't tried

387
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,860
our coffee here, right?

388
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,580
Let's go.

389
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,060
-I'll get you some coffee.
-Let's go.

390
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,580
Actually,

391
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,030
as a fan of that book,

392
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,030
I kind of didn't like it

393
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,110
when I heard that

394
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,620
you

395
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,180
were going to play this role.

396
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,980
But after watching you act,

397
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,350
Ms. Tang.

398
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,400
I think it's great.

399
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,830
The event will be held here tomorrow.

400
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,880
Let me give you a tour of the set

401
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,190
to see which angle

402
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,470
would be better for your live show.

403
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,510
All right.

404
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,500
The slap just now

405
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,030
was a real slap?

406
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,980
Does it hurt?

407
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,060
It's a real slap.

408
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,030
Well, not very painful.

409
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,230
Oh, you...

410
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,390
Lu Fangning?

411
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,580
What is she doing with the idol?

412
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
It's long?

413
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,500
Just cut a little bit.

414
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,270
You've finally revealed yourself.

415
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,910
Ms. Tang.

416
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,660
Shall we

417
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,350
go to see

418
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,260
the next location?

419
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,700
No, I want to watch this.

420
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Ms. Tang.

421
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,310
The breach of the contract
would cost you 100,000 yuan.

422
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,900
All right.

423
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,980
No problem.

424
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,060
However,

425
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,390
why don't you go wait over there?

426
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,670
I'll be right there in a minute, okay?

427
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,020
Okay, sure.

428
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,550
I think he's really good.

429
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,980
Besides,

430
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,340
I think he's a good working partner.

431
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,390
He's so nice.

432
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,860
And he is

433
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,630
very humorous at the set,

434
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,950
always making us laugh.

435
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,260
So what are you going to shoot next?

436
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,870
The next scene...

437
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,030
I don't think it's okay for me to tell you.

438
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,870
I'll send it to Ling Rui.

439
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,620
Let him see what you are really like.

440
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,990
Is she coming back for dinner?

441
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,830
Should I buy some food?

442
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,310
What am I hesitating about?

443
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm going to sort

444
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,270
everything out.

445
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,860
And I'm not going to let you

446
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,190
feel uncomfortable.

447
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,780
That's what she means about

448
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,100
sorting out everything

449
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,270
and not giving me any trouble?

450
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,230
[She looks happy.]

451
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,070
This is your script?

452
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,020
You're taking your job pretty seriously.

453
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,780
However,

454
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,750
the scene that you just did,

455
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,420
what does it mean?

456
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,260
The doctor's trying to piss off his CEO brother,

457
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,390
so he intentionally got close to

458
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,820
the woman that the CEO likes.

459
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,470
What does that mean? What the hell?

460
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,020
But the title of the show is

461
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,340
Doctor, CEO and Me.

462
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,300
The doctor and the CEO

463
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,190
are meant to be together.

464
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,300
What exactly have they

465
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,860
changed in the script?

466
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,900
Why does it feel so different

467
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,740
from the original novel?

468
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,380
You can't read that.

469
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,790
-No.
-Let me have a look.

470
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,060
Ms. Lu, you really can't.

471
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,220
I'm Lu Fangning.

472
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,260
I won't tell anyone.

473
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,220
No one can look at that.

474
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,740
Lu Fangning!

475
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Just a glance, okay?

476
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,820
I'm just going to have a glance.

477
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,620
-Just a glance.
-No.

478
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,540
Lu Fangning.

479
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,940
What are you doing here?

480
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,150
What are you doing here?

481
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,500
I'm here to buy groceries.

482
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,710
Here?

483
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,230
The vegetables here are fresher.

484
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,630
This is...

485
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,910
He's just passing by.

486
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,790
You don't have to worry.

487
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,940
He'll be gone in a minute.

488
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,110
You can leave now.

489
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,710
I still have something important

490
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,260
to discuss with him.

491
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,540
Now that I'm here,

492
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,180
I'll just wait for you to go home together.

493
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,060
Why?

494
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,620
Did you know how much fuel

495
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,940
you can save by

496
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,340
driving one car instead of two?

497
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,940
And how much does energy conservation

498
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,630
could benefit the environment.

499
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,710
It's time for each and every one of us

500
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,500
to get involved

501
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,940
into this action

502
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,750
to curb global warming,

503
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,110
and to contribute to humanity.

504
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,190
This gentleman here

505
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,940
seems very environmentally conscious.

506
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,540
Please continue.

507
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,420
I won't disturb you.

508
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,940
How are we supposed to talk

509
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,980
with you sitting here?

510
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,230
What do you want to talk about

511
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,740
that I can't listen to?

512
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,750
No, no. No such things.

513
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,860
[Why is he here?]

514
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,020
[To keep an eye on me?]

515
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,310
[To control me?]

516
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,380
[At least you can't talk about]

517
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,820
[something inappropriate if I'm here.]

518
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,710
If you really

519
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,620
have nothing to do,

520
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,590
you can go to the hospital.

521
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,020
The patients need your help.

522
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,750
There're doctors on call.

523
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,870
You're a doctor?

524
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,950
I played a doctor.

525
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,430
I'm playing a surgeon.

526
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,260
Only the white coat makes

527
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,150
you like a surgeon.

528
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,590
If I could just act like you,

529
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,470
that would be nice.

530
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,070
That's impossible.

531
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,660
By the way,

532
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,070
there are some

533
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,950
technical terms here

534
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,630
that I haven't figured out.
Please have a look.

535
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,500
It's just saying that...

536
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,180
Hello, sir.

537
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,460
I'm the casting director for the show.

538
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,590
Are you interested in acting

539
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,300
or being a guest star

540
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,940
in our drama?

541
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,740
I can pay you

542
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,950
the maximum wage.

543
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,940
Please tell me

544
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,620
what this means first.

545
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,030
You guys, that's enough.

546
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,620
This is my husband,

547
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,380
not an actor.

548
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,580
What are you laughing at?

549
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,100
No, I can't be like this.

550
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
I need to maintain my cold image.

551
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,990
Calm down and ignore him.

552
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,900
Bai Jing.

553
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,750
Didn't you say

554
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,230
you wanted to play the doctor well?

555
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,590
Would you like to come to my house?

556
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,630
What?

557
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,590
Bai Jing.

558
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,580
This is a house

559
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,780
of a surgeon.

560
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,990
Take a look around.

561
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,300
Make yourself at home.

562
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,510
Slippers are on the floor.

563
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,260
Come here.

564
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,670
Bai Jing, take a look around.

565
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,260
What's up?

566
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,230
Why did you bring him home?

567
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,910
Why can't I bring him home?

568
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,590
I'm helping him to play a doctor.

569
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,140
What's wrong with helping people?

570
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,620
Does playing a doctor

571
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,990
have anything to do with you?

572
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,550
Because he might be...

573
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,230
No, he would definitely be

574
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,510
the face of

575
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,580
Infinity.

576
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,940
Him?

577
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,980
The face of your brand?

578
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,230
All right.

579
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,050
[Block 2, Unit 107]

580
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
Even if that's true,

581
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,230
you can see him in the office

582
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,580
or in the ads.

583
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,390
Why do you have to bring him home?

584
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,140
Because he's young and handsome.

585
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,470
Don't you think our house

586
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,150
looks much better

587
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,660
with him here?

588
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,380
This house looks glorious because of him.

589
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,340
Excuse me...

590
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,300
-Don't speak.
-Shut up.

591
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,550
I'm sorry.

592
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,860
Kid.

593
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,870
What do you want to eat? I'll cook.

594
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,510
No, no, don't bother.

595
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,540
Let him do it.

596
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,980
He loves to cook.

597
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,350
Go ahead.

598
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,940
Let me guess what you would cook.

599
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,350
Greens again, right?

600
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,030
Well, that's all you can cook.

601
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,220
Why didn't you buy more meat?

602
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,390
Don't just cook me and Bai Jing greens.

603
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,900
Ms. Lu.

604
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,630
Is it inconvenient

605
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,700
for me to be here?

606
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,620
Of course not.

607
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,980
What's wrong with me?

608
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,660
She just brought a business partner home.

609
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,820
What's the big deal?

610
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,030
Yeah.

611
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,990
Just a business partner.

612
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,830
Young?

613
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,780
Handsome?

614
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,750
Cheerful?

615
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,300
Is what I'm wearing today

616
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,740
a little too dark?

617
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,590
That's why I look more mature?

618
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,260
How about changing into white?

619
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,420
White

620
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,830
is my color.

621
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,900
So, is it tough when you are shooting?

622
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,990
No.

623
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,820
Not as tough as Dr. Ling's job, I assume.

624
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,020
By the way,

625
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,060
does he read

626
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,420
all the books in your house?

627
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,700
He likes to read all the time.

628
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,910
Oh,

629
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,630
it's a nice day today.

630
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,020
By the way,

631
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,740
can you tell me

632
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,780
what the ending is like?

633
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,430
I promise I won't tell anyone.

634
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:36,830
I swear.

635
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
I really can't.

636
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,860
A lot of people have asked me about this.

637
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,740
This flower hasn't been

638
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,260
watered recently.

639
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,070
Please tell me.

640
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,980
It's almost dead.

641
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,420
I'm Lu Fangning, after all.

642
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,260
Who am I going to tell?

643
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,470
Just a little bit.

644
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,860
Ms. Lu, I really can't.

645
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,190
We signed an NDA.

646
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,140
I really can't talk about it.

647
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,820
What was his reaction just now?

648
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,950
Jealousy?

649
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,630
No, no, no.

650
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,140
How could he be jealous?

651
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Then...

652
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,830
If you can't

653
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,020
tell me any spoiler,

654
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,630
then why don't you tell me that

655
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
in the end,

656
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,580
who will you end up with?

657
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,380
This table is dirty.

658
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,260
You can certainly tell me that, right?

659
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,910
Let me wipe it.

660
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Ms. Lu, you don't know.

661
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,110
No scriptwriter dares

662
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,980
to write a bad ending nowadays.

663
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,300
They have to give it a happy ending

664
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,380
even if it doesn't make sense.

665
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,590
Oh.

666
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,500
Something fell on the floor.

667
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,020
It's broken. What should I do?

668
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,190
Boring.

669
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,660
I am going to do the cooking.

670
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,460
Go ahead.

671
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,230
Let's go sit inside.

672
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,990
Give me two bottles of water.

673
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,670
There's no water.

674
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,300
It's right over there.

675
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,950
It's expired.

676
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,660
Childish.

677
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,580
Just ignore him.

678
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,420
Have some water, please.

679
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,100
Thank you.

680
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,950
Ms. Lu.

681
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,550
Maybe I shall leave.

682
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,300
No, sit here.

683
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,990
Dr. Ling is still wearing

684
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,180
white at home.

685
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,950
He looks sparkling.

686
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,270
It's hard to imitate that.

687
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,790
Of course it is.

688
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,220
You have an advantage.

689
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,860
What?

690
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,140
You got good taste.

691
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,110
By the way, Bai Jing,

692
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,190
how tall are you?

693
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,110
I'm 180.

694
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,190
180 cm?

695
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,270
I love boys who are 180 cm tall.

696
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,230
I think it's the perfect height.

697
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,100
A little higher

698
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,670
would make someone look a little clumsy.

699
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,190
You like 180 cm,

700
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,060
but not 186 cm?

701
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,740
Your uncle is even three centimeters

702
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,870
taller than me.

703
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,750
Why didn't you call him clumsy?

704
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,510
I just recalled that

705
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,620
I remember

706
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,140
I had a bag of chips once,

707
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,180
which was very good.

708
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,310
It's endorsed by you.

709
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,990
What is it called?

710
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,380
If you like it,

711
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,350
I'll ask my manager

712
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,100
to send you a box of it.

713
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,340
No need.

714
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,150
I'll buy two boxes.

715
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,350
I'll buy ten boxes, to support you.

716
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,270
No, that's not necessary.

717
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,260
So young, handsome

718
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,820
and you know how to make money.

719
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
You're really good.

720
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,430
I save lives.

721
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,190
My spirit is nobler.

722
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,190
I'm in a good mood today.

723
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,070
After the meal,

724
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,310
have a drink with me.

725
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,820
Drink wine?

726
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,940
Do you drink?

727
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,140
You don't know,

728
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,580
there's someone in this house

729
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,260
who really can't drink.

730
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,780
If he takes just a little sip,

731
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,430
he would pass out in no time.

732
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,660
That's so weak.

733
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,980
Who says I can't drink?

734
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,500
I am just trying to

735
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,300
keep a regular lifestyle.

736
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,420
I just go to bed early.

737
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,180
How about video games?

738
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,820
I'm actually really into video games.

739
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,740
But as you can see,

740
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,630
there are so many books in this house.

741
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,540
Someone just

742
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,150
reads books all the time.

743
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,700
And when he drinks,

744
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,740
he would recite

745
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,860
the terms of medical books.

746
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,540
I don't even know what that means. It's so boring.

747
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,980
And someone just

748
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,350
likes reading about parenting

749
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,630
secretly.

750
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,140
Well, why don't you give me

751
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,950
a baby to practice?

752
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Coward.

753
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,060
You're different, Bai Jing.

754
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,190
You look like

755
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,060
a real man.

756
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,220
You look very brave.

757
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,860
A real man.

758
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,670
Are you saying I'm not a man?

759
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,710
Come here, Bai Jing.

760
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,350
Let's compare.

761
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,500
Let's see who is the real man.

762
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,030
What are you doing?

763
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,460
-Let go.
-Come on.

764
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:22,900
Let go.

765
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,510
Don't bully the kid.

766
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,550
I...

767
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,830
I bully him?

768
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,710
You're bullying me.

769
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,060
You're not a kid.

770
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,940
Put the knife down.

771
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,300
I won't.

772
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,620
See?

773
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,740
That's human nature.

774
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,100
No matter how professional a surgeon is,

775
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,550
he would also get out of control.

776
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,220
I mean, look

777
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,940
how annoyed he is right now.

778
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,910
I am not out of control.

779
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,510
Did you see it?

780
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,660
Use it in the show.

781
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,460
Out of control, me?

782
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,220
I'm not out of control.

783
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,590
-You're not out of control?
-I'm going to go to the bathroom.

784
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,630
You're not out of control?

785
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
I'm not out of control.

786
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,060
Your face is flushed with anger!

787
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,990
I'm not!

788
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,790
You're getting agitated.

789
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,740
And you're flushing.

790
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,150
Your neck has even became shorter.

791
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,660
How the hell would my neck...

792
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,740
I got a swan neck.

793
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,980
You look like a little frog to me.

794
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,950
Quack, quack.

795
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,340
You're like a donkey.

796
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,270
Blah blah blah.

797
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,270
Then why did you marry

798
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,980
a donkey?

799
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,260
You're married to a little frog.

800
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,860
Come and get me, Ziwen!

801
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,990
What's up?

802
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,990
I've got work to do here.

803
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,670
No.

804
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,420
I need you to come to get me.

805
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,940
Just think of it as a way

806
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,380
to gain more life experience.

807
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,190
You can't offend your sponsor.

808
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,700
-Come on. I...
-I'm hanging up.

809
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,070
Goodbye.

810
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,380
Don't know who

811
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,940
just tried to

812
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,100
get under my covers.

813
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,510
I...

814
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,910
I was delirious.

815
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,900
So you're sane now?

816
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,940
A kid.

817
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,060
I'm just a kid.

818
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,230
I'm going to go home now.

819
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,740
Stop.

820
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,740
Get out of my way.

821
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,900
We haven't had a meal together yet.

822
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,940
Where are you going?

823
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,740
Thank you both.

824
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,100
I learned a valuable lesson.

825
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,750
Lesson?

826
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,540
What lesson?

827
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,380
What have you learned?

828
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,590
Love makes people crazy.

829
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,590
Bye.

830
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,220
You're leaving?

831
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
I've got to go now.

832
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,540
You are not staying for a meal?

833
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,140
No!

834
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,620
All right.

835
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,260
See you later.

836
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,870
Goodbye...

837
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,540
Are you jealous?

838
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,510
Why would I be jealous?

839
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,900
If you want some vinegar,
[*Eating vinegar, a metaphor of jealousy]

840
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,900
I can make you sour and sweet ribs,

841
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,510
sour fish, and sour cabbage.

842
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,550
Which one do you want?

843
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,940
I don't know how to make either of them.

844
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,110
All I can make is poached vegetables.

845
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,950
Take your time.

846
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,030
Have some more.

847
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,980
Get your knife.

848
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,460
No.

849
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,630
I'm just going to cook.

850
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,460
I didn't hear that.

851
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,060
By the way,

852
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,100
donkeys don't bark like that.

853
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,550
Exactly.

854
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,190
That's more like it.

855
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,660
Immature.

856
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,150
That really pissed me off.

857
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,339
A loving girlfriend like me

858
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,149
is the rarest thing in the world.

859
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,580
What's taking him so long?

860
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,899
Did he run into the bad guys again?

861
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,260
Siyu.

862
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:12,980
Sorry.

863
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,510
I'm getting a little too excited.

864
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,340
How's your bruise healing?

865
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,260
Are you all right?

866
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,460
I'm fine.

867
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,220
Sorry that I'm late.

868
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,460
It's all right.

869
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,740
I'm just glad you're safe.

870
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,860
Here.

871
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
This is for you.

872
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,020
For me?

873
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,030
I specifically looked into it.

874
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,380
This is Eustoma grandiflorum.

875
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,350
It represents "true and unchanging love."

876
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,740
It's a perfect souvenir for

877
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,700
our first official date.

878
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,350
Siyu.

879
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,310
You called me Siyu.

880
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,980
Give me your hand.

881
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,710
Your hand.

882
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,700
Let's go.

883
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,390
I'll introduce you

884
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,780
to my favorite food.

885
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,260
This tastes so good.

886
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,790
Would you like to try it?

887
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,260
Let me.

888
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,150
This dessert is called

889
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,070
"Let's date".

890
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,580
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

891
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Someone who was

892
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,940
so far away from me

893
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,350
is actually sitting across from me

894
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,990
and eating with me right now.

895
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,900
Are you thinking

896
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,180
too badly of yourself?

897
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,950
Director Lu, you have such good taste

898
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,060
and such high standards,

899
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,180
I can't degrade you.

900
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,660
You won't.

901
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,860
Don't think like that.

902
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,340
You're actually very cute.

903
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,860
So I'm just cute.

904
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,780
I know that

905
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,390
you invited me to dinner out of the blue

906
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,740
and accepted my confession,

907
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,180
that's something very rare,

908
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,700
and there must be a reason.

909
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,980
Besides,

910
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,620
I don't think

911
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,950
it's because of the reason I imagined.

912
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,020
Even though I love reading novels

913
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,830
and daydreaming,

914
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm not stupid.

915
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,900
But that's okay.

916
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,500
I could have a moment

917
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,870
where dreams come true,

918
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,060
I'm happy enough.

919
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,190
And

920
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,510
I'm going to

921
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,020
try to make you

922
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,230
like me a little more

923
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,300
and love me a little more every day.

924
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,150
Even if I failed eventually,

925
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,230
I have been the main character

926
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,470

Let me take a peek at my "husband" before work.

Look at this picture of him

939
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,460
and his suit.

940

That's my man, Bai Jing.

941
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,860
Who do you think he looks like?

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,500
Does he look like that foreign actor...

944

What are you doing here?

945
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,580
It's not even working hours yet.

946

fans?

948
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,340
How is this?

949

Are you amazed at how handsome he is?

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,190
What's so handsome about him?

951
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,230
What?

952
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,660
He is totally handsome, all right?

953
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,140
I think you're just jealous.

954
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,870
Bai Jing

955
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,350
has thousands of fans.

956
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:31,750
If a guy like him

957
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,060
could be my husband,

958
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,740
I can do anything.

959
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,150
No, you can't.

960
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,110
This guy looks like

961
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,470
someone who can't make a hit.

962
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,500
What did he just say?

963
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,310
He can't make it?

964
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,100
What did he mean?

965
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,830
I've got to

966
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,430
-reason with him.
-It's okay.

967
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,380
What does he mean?

968
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,620
-It's okay, Maomao.
-Our Bai Jing is already famous.

969
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,060
All right?

970
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,620
-All right.
-Relax.

971
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,500
Do you want some vinegar?

972
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,780
Vinegar?

973
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,020
I'm not jealous.

974
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,110
I'm asking if you want

975
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,100
some vinegar in the noodles.

976
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,900
No.

977
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,700
Thanks.

978
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,350
What report are you reading?

979
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,340
You didn't even get what I was asking.

980
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,350
Is he handsome?
