[Begin Again]

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 32]

4
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,170
Why isn't he here yet?

5
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,210
He should be here by now.

6
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,730
Didn't he say he was free on weekends?

7
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,050
If he doesn't come,

8
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,650
how can I get inspiration?

9
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,170
A great man can stoop or stand.

10
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,770
All great writers do that.

11
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,770
What can I do

12
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,890
when my muse is gone?

13
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,210
I'll go to him myself.

14
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,890
Who is it?

15
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,240
Wait a minute.

16
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,970
Why are you here?

17
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,530
[Muse's house.]

18
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,610
[A place of happiness.]

19
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,770
[Let me feel it well.]

20
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,490
Normcore style.

21
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,849
As expected.

22
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,010
You...

23
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,090
Why are you here?

24
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,890
You never came,

25
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,130
so I come here instead.

26
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,290
You mean,

27
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,250
I didn't go to your house,

28
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,090
so you were sad.

29
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,730
Then, you came to mine instead.

30
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,490
Lu Yiyao, why is it

31
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,530
you can't understand

32
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,609
human language?

33
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,480
What I meant was...

34
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,130
It was...

35
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,690
the spirit of

36
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,290
not giving up halfway.

37
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,530
You haven't got the answer to

38
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,810
your question yet.

39
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,609
I was worried that one day

40
00:04:58,609 --> 00:04:59,250
if you have a whim for it,

41
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,330
you might bother me again.

42
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,930
I have some time today.

43
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,450
I'm here to answer it.

44
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,530
You don't feel well?

45
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,770
I'm fine.

46
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,650
I'm fine, I knew it.

47
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,050
You can't be so weak.

48
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,450
[Succinct, clean, monotonous,]

49
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,810
[very overbearing.]

50
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,330
[Not bad, not bad.]

51
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,290
Cai Siyu,

52
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,290
what are you doing here?

53
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm here…

54
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,970
Why are you standing here?

55
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,250
Sit down.

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,890
Your behavior

57
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,410
will make me misunderstand.

58
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,130
I will think that

59
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,690
you don't want to see me.

60
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,010
Come on, sit down.

61
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,130
I…

62
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,609
Cai Siyu!

63
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:57,450
What's wrong with me?

64
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,330
That's enough!

65
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,450
What's wrong with you? You're…

66
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,250
Do not touch my waist.

67
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,770
Did you hurt your waist?

68
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,090
The waist is a very important part.

69
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,770
I know.

70
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,520
Thank you.

71
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,530
Then, how did you get hurt?

72
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,610
Gym?

73
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,780
Plumbing?

74
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,650
I'm old.

75
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,370
I have the muscular strain, okay?

76
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,130
Okay, okay.

77
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,810
You are sick.

78
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,130
You're sick!

79
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,810
Calm down. Relax.

80
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,730
I didn't know you had hurt your waist.

81
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,090
I won't touch you.

82
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,010
I won't.

83
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,200
[He didn't come]

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,010
[because he wasn't feeling well.]

85
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,240
[I feel pity for him.]

86
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,370
[Then I'll forgive you.]

87
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,010
Lu Yiyao,

88
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:46,970
did you see a doctor?

89
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:49,850
Yes.

90
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,810
[An old man staying at home alone.]

91
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,130
[He wouldn't die of loneliness, right?]

92
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,970
[You are my muse.]

93
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,970
[A sick muse is also a muse.]

94
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,690
[I'm here now.]

95
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,850
[You'll get my pity.]

96
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,450
Don't worry.

97
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,850
I'll take care of you.

98
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,370
Don't you have to work?

99
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,090
What about your book?

100
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,090
It's okay. Have a look.

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,570
I've brought my laptop with me.

102
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,290
You should be hungry by now.

103
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,530
I'll cook for you.

104
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,250
Never mind.

105
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,730
It's okay.

106
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,410
I'm good at cooking.

107
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,210
Just sit here.

108
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,130
Don't move.

109
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,050
It won't take long.

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,490
Your meal is ready.

111
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,050
Meal?

112
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,690
A meal for the patient.

113
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,250
What's the smell?

114
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,850
Charred fragrance.

115
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,090
It improves appetite and promotes digestion.

116
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,850
I'm not hungry. I don't want to eat.

117
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,970
Of course you have to eat.

118
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,609
If you don't eat, you won't get better.

119
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,890
I told you, no.

120
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,570
Eat them yourself.

121
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,450
You're an old man,

122
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,090
why do you act like a child?

123
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,850
I won't eat them anyway.

124
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,050
Then I'll feed you.

125
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,490
[Spoonfeeding is]

126
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,930
[very common in novels.]

127
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,970
Great.

128
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,490
Open up.

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,770
It's hot!

130
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,810
Come here.

131
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,770
Old man,

132
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,580
why can't you just behave?

133
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,330
I've had enough.

134
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,010
No, it took great effort

135
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,090
to make them.

136
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,690
You can't waste food.

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,490
Come on.

138
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,850
How is it?

139
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,730
Sweet, very sweet.

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,130
Oh my!

141
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,250
You're really good

142
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,210
with your fancy words.

143
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,690
What I meant was the texture.

144
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,410
I mean, it's too sweet.

145
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,130
It's too much.

146
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,850
There is water over there.

147
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,730
Get it for me.

148
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,770
Tell me,

149
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,410
why did you

150
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,730
put so much sugar in the congee?

151
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,690
I thought

152
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,890
you're sick now.

153
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,730
You couldn't taste the flavor.

154
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
So, I added some sugar to it for you.

155
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,770
When I was sick as a child,

156
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,450
my mom made me sweet congee.

157
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,890
Don't you think you added too much sugar?

158
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,370
I bet you added the whole jar into it.

159
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,130
It was an accident.

160
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,250
Look at my delicate hands.

161
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,740
They are more suitable for typing.

162
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,850
Eat up.

163
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,610
Try the pickles.

164
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,280
[Cai Siyu]

165
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,490
[Chapter One: In a brightly lit and spacious room, a woman sits on the couch.]

166
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,880
[The color brings out the fairness of her skin. She looks confident.]

167
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,810
[He still eats alone.]

168
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,850
[He goes to work and goes home alone.]

169
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,450
[Very few people would dare]

170
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,690
[to approach him.]

171
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,690
[She can think of]

172
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,570
[how cold and lonely his world is.]

173
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,250
[There is nothing she can do.]

174
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,970
[She can only dash around]

175
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,800
[to break into his world.]

176
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,690
[Mr. Lu,]

177
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,730
I like you.

178
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,570
Can you be my boyfriend?

179
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,170
[They broke up.]

180
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,210
[She knew that]

181
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,170
[he had never loved her.]

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,620
[So, she scolded him for being a jerk.]

183
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,610
[In fact, he wasn't one.]

184
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,890
[In her heart,]

185
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,170
[he is a brave man.]

[one needs more courage]

189
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,250
[than what it takes to embrace love.]

190
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,690
I told you I didn't mind.

191
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,410
I just don't care!

192
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,690
[She prays for one thing only.]

193
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,170
[She only prays that]

194
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,170
[the poor man]

195
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,370
[can smile more]

196
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,970
[and stop living this pitiful life.]

197
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,290
[So, she wants to leave him]

198
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:21,890
[without hesitation.]

199
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,650
[She wants to be freed of the urge]

200
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,170
[to embrace him once more.]

201
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,290
[Although he's]

202
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,010
[an obnoxious old man,]

203
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,330
[he's still handsome.]

204
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,570
[Lu Yiyao, you...]

205
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,290
I was asleep.

206
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,450
What about just now?

207
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,130
Just now...

208
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
I must have been sleepwalking.

209
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,330
Sleepwalking?

210
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,490
When you sleepwalk, you turn into a thug?

211
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,370
You're sick, okay? You need treatments.

212
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Get up!

213
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,530
My waist!

214
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,530
Make it clear!

215
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,130
Explain!

216
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,450
Siyu,

217
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,210
will you give me another chance?

218
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,970
[What's going on now?]

219
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,610
[I was taking care of the sick CEO,]

220
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,210
[and now he's flirting with me.]

221
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,170
This time,

222
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,370
I don't care about anyone else.

223
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,610
I don't need any answers either.

224
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,730
I just want...

225
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,440
I just want to

226
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,610
stay with you.

227
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,570
[Illusions. These are all illusions!]

228
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,330
[I can't believe him.]

229
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,450
Ouch!

230
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,130
Did it hurt?

231
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,330
Are you awake now?

232
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,330
Listen,

233
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,770
I don't like you anymore.

234
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,810
You don't have to answer right away.

235
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,370
I just...

236
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,450
I just want you

237
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,850
to give me one more chance.

238
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,210
Let me try it again.

239
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,170
I don't want to try it.

240
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,490
Are you still mad at me

241
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,280
because of what happened that time?

242
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,410
Hear me out. Before…

243
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,130
Lu Yiyao,

244
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,530
don't be so full of yourself, okay?

245
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,810
I'm full of myself?

246
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,050
Fine.

247
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,370
Tell me,

248
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,770
of the novels you're writing now,

249
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,090
which male protagonist

250
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,730
isn't based on me?

251
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,730
You read my books?

252
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,050
No, no.

253
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,730
I'm asking you,

254
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,050
the male protagonist

255
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,130
in this novel

256
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,180
you're writing now,

257
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,640
isn't he just like me?

258
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,690
Male protagonists of romance novels

259
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,610
are all the same.

260
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,050
They are all like this?

261
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,610
Then I should read more of these.

262
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,570
Anyway,

263
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,890
I just saw a detail.

264
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,210
It sounded just like me.

265
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,330
Perhaps I should read it out to you?

266
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,570
Lu Yiyao, you...

267
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,850
Yes, I admit it.

268
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,730
When I think of you,

269
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,850
I feel particularly inspired.

270
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,020
I feel immersed in the story.

271
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,450
I wrote every novel

272
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,930
based on parts of your image.

273
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,130
So what?

274
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,840
I just

275
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,130
make use of you.

276
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,360
Make use of?

277
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,410
Use me if you want.

278
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,690
I won't make a fuss about it with you.

279
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,650
Use the real me as your material.

280
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,920
I don't need that.

281
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,680
Isn't it better to look at the real person and then imagine?

282
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,970
No.

283
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:17,330
A living man

284
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,400
is standing in front of you.

285
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,200
But you prefer an imaginary one.

286
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,809
Yes.

287
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,809
Is the imaginary man

288
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,010
better than a real man?

289
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,330
Why are you so wordy?

290
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,970
The imaginary man is certainly better.

291
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,289
The man in my imagination

292
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,400
won't lie to me,

293
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
won't toy with my feeling,

294
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
or make me upset.

295
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,809
He worries about me,

296
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:34,920
but I don't need to worry about him.

297
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,650
He will do everything

298
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,569
that I order him to do.

299
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:37,930
When I ask him to sleep, he will…

300
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,770
Anyway, he can do anything.

301
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,290
I can't understand it.

302
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,370
I don't need men like you

303
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,530
to understand it.

304
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,330
Listen carefully.

305
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,690
I live

306
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,850
a happy life alone.

307
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,370
Men are troublesome!

308
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,690
My waist!

309
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,370
Take it easy.

310
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,410
-Get out of the way.
-My waist!

311
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,450
Cai Siyu!

312
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,370
Cai Siyu,

313
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,330
can you please keep your composure?

314
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,740
You can't be fooled by these tricks

315
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,570
he used six years ago.

316
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,650
No.

317
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,210
I need a distraction.

318
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,930
I need to…

319
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,770
I need to…

320
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,650
I need to work out in the gym

321
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,160
and get all sweaty.

322
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,610
Press down your center of gravity. Straighten your back.

323
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,810
Come on.

324
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,530
Old man,

325
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,290
this isn't the place for you.

326
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,650
Why?

327
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,240
I work out every day, okay?

328
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,090
It won't work.

329
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,050
I...

330
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,170
I'll watch some movies.

331
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,130
I'll date myself.

332
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,130
Cai Siyu,

333
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,210
you are so familiar with

334
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,010
these tricks.

335
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,690
Why can't you keep a level head?

336
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,410
It's no good.

337
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,770
I need to talk to someone.

338
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,450
Why are you here?

339
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,250
Youyou's not here.

340
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,010
Nobody will discuss novels with you.

341
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,970
Wait.

342
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,770
Ms. Lu,

343
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,090
my conception

344
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,370
is particularly complex this time.

345
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,890
I must discuss it with someone of your level,

346
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,570
someone who has your experience

347
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,650
in love.

348
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,710
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

349
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,410
Your waist injury

350
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,690
is not that serious.

351
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,650
But you must rest well.

352
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,970
Remember to apply for the medicine.

353
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,370
Avoid vigorous exercises.

354
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,900
It will heal gradually.

355
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,170
You're not young. Take care.

356
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,090
Thank you, doctor.

357
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,970
That's all.

358
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,970
You may leave now.

359
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,690
Am I old?

360
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,610
My skin is quite good.

361
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,530
He said I was old. Really...

362
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,210
Simon,

363
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,490
what brought you here?

364
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,610
I...

365
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,250
I came to see a doctor.

366
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,210
Are you okay?

367
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,370
I'm fine. I had an X-ray.

368
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,170
I accidentally bumped into something recently.

369
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,090
I had some minor injury.

370
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,530
I'm glad you're alright.

371
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,210
Pay attention to your health.

372
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,010
If you need anything,

373
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,490
contact me anytime.

374
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,290
Okay.

375
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,490
I'm going to work now.

376
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,410
Wait.

377
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,210
Are you free after work?

378
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,090
Come on.

379
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,010
Ling Rui,

380
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,400
what do women

381
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,610
think nowadays?

382
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,460
Tell me, what's going on

383
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,650
in this man's mind?

384
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,010
Lu Yiyao used me.

385
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,730
Now he's turning over a new leaf

386
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,490
to win my back.

387
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,050
I won't let myself be fooled!

388
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,450
I will not forgive him!

389
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,890
A jerk should always be nailed to

390
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,090
the pillar of shame!

391
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,850
The past is the past.

392
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,170
The present is now.

393
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,930
I've already apologized to her.

394
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,850
I've admitted my mistakes

395
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,930
so sincerely.

396
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,890
Why can't she let go

397
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,810
of the past?

398
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,930
She's unpredictable.

399
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,690
It's getting on my nerve.

400
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,330
He even kissed me!

401
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,130
Did he really think

402
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,450
he was an overbearing boss?

403
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,530
He was disrespectful.

404
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,890
It was sexual harassment.

405
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,010
I must call the police.

406
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,970
It's obvious that she likes me.

407
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,450
But she doesn't admit it.

408
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,730
She lives

409
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,930
in her imagination every day.

410
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,650
She is unwilling to face the reality.

411
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,890
What's going on

412
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,130
in her mind right now?

413
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,330
What is he thinking right now?

414
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,690
Actually...

415
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,530
Actually, I don't know either.

416
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,730
It's okay, Ms. Lu.

417
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,810
This issue is indeed complicated.

418
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,330
It's normal if you don't know. Come on.

419
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,770
But, Cai Siyu,

420
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,090
let me ask you a question.

421
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,650
In terms of the forced kiss,

422
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,130
are you sure you didn't get the wrong meaning?

423
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,410
It depends on the look of that person.

424
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,170
Well, that guy

425
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,610
is quite handsome.

426
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,330
Did Dr. Ling do the same thing to you?

427
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,730
You and Dr. Ling, are you back together?

428
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,930
You reconciled with him?

429
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,090
Yes, we are back together now.

430
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,770
But is this a happy ending?

431
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,370
What happened to you guys?

432
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,090
Your problem seems more complicated than mine.

433
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,690
Here's the thing.

434
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,730
He's very gentle sometimes.

435
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,250
He's very thoughtful.

436
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,130
But sometimes,

437
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,090
he's very distant and bossy.

438
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,810
In short, he's not quite the same

439
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,570
as he used to be.

440
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,210
When he was with me,

441
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,370
he said we were meant for each other.

442
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,170
What does that mean?

443
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:46,970
Meant for each other?

444
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,700
Does he mean

445
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,970
we are meant for each other

446
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,890
because I gave birth to his son?

447
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,250
Or did he just say it casually?

448
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,330
Does Ling Rui want to

449
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,130
take revenge on me, or punish me?

450
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,490
If Dr. Ling did hate you,

451
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,490
it would be understandable.

452
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,850
After all, you were cruel enough

453
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,090
not to tell him anything six years ago.

454
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,250
Yes, I got it.

455
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,650
A jerk should always be nailed to

456
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,610
the pillar of shame.

457
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,370
A jerk like me must suffer the same fate.

458
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,220
But what could I do?

459
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,290
At that time,

460
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,650
I was young, impulsive, and carefree.

461
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,810
Besides,

462
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,890
he didn't tell me

463
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,690
he wouldn't leave for Germany.

464
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,690
Are you saying Dr. Ling refused

465
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,570
to go to Germany

466
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,090
six years ago because of you?

467
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,650
At that time,

468
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,690
I was informed of his decision.

469
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,770
Going to Germany for further study

470
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,810
was very important

471
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,930
for him.

472
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,370
It was his dream.

473
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,410
After I found out,

474
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,370
it bothered me

475
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,930
so greatly.

476
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,780
Poor thing.

477
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,970
It's okay.

478
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,090
Even Dr. Ling was a jerk.

479
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,650
So, in that case,

480
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,130
the husbands on my computer

481
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,450
never give me any worries.

482
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,410
Even if there were some tricks,

483
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,370
I'd be the mastermind.

484
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,330
And they are also…

485
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,930
Where is my laptop?

486
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,370
Where is my laptop?

487
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,490
Lu Yiyao.

488
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,850
Actually, I don't know either.

489
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,210
You don't know?

490
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,170
Come on.

491
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,890
How are you guys doing now?

492
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,490
We're back together.

493
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,250
Back together?

494
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,570
You just let her off so easily.

495
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,160
I had thought about

496
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,810
taking a stance.

497
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,850
I wanted her to realize she was wrong.

498
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,850
But on second thought,

499
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,930
it didn't matter.

500
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,240
Anyway, she has her way

501
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,650
of keeping me soft.

502
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,490
So, I admitted my defeat.

503
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,010
Can you please

504
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,130
not make me laugh again?

505
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,450
It's not about winning the argument.

506
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,330
I want to admit my defeat too.

507
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,210
But no one

508
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,450
gives me a chance.

509
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,810
It's okay.

510
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,610
You two have a happy ending.

511
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,370
That's good.

512
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,570
But am I

513
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,840
doing the right thing?

514
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,770
What did you do wrong?

515
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,250
I didn't even give her

516
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,490
a chance to say no.

517
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,490
I haven't told her

518
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,690
I was still in love with her.

519
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,610
I was afraid

520
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,140
she would

521
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,370
reject me.

522
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,690
So I made her stay

523
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,970
by any means necessary.

524
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,020
I was scared she might

525
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,330
secretly disappear from my life again.

526
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,010
However,

527
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,210
every time when I see her

528
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,730
act with cautions while I'm around,

529
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,410
I can't help but be angry again.

530
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,170
I'm angry at her,

531
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,010
and at myself.

532
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,850
So,

533
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,370
you asked the wrong person.

534
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,690
Come on, let's go.

535
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,850
Where are we going?

536
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,930
We haven't finished the beer yet.

537
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,770
Not yet.

538
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,450
You've had enough.

539
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,690
You can't drink anymore.

540
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,370
We can still order.

541
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,040
Boss, more beer.

542
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,370
Don't listen to him.

543
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,610
Stop drinking. You can't drink anymore.

544
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,370
You're drunk. Let's go home.

545
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,890
I can have more!

546
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,490
I'm telling you,

547
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,330
I sleep with others whenever I get drunk.

548
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,010
I need to overcome this bad habit.

549
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,410
I said,

550
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,650
I didn't want to go to bed.

551
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,690
You can't sleep here.

552
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,890
Let's go. Go home.

553
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,810
Have you paid for the bill?

554
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,210
Yes, I have.

555
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,570
Won't you consider getting it back

556
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,210
once Simon is home?

557
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,890
I've told you everything

558
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,590
[1806]

559
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,650
that had happened between us.

560
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,690
I really don't want to

561
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,780
meet him again.

562
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,930
I'll leave once I've got it.

563
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,290
It won't take long.

564
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,690
My baby.

565
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,010
All right, be quick.

566
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,490
Okay. That's all.

567
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,450
Let's go, Ms. Lu.

568
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,170
Are you okay?

569
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,730
-Fangning.
-Ling Rui.

570
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,970
-You...
-You...

571
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,210
Why are you at my house?

572
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,770
Why can't I be here?

573
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,620
I came to get my computer,

574
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,930
my moneymaker,

575
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,610
my treasure.

576
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,170
Here is the person you love.

577
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,210
Not there.

578
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,530
Hands off.

579
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,690
Do you deserve this title?

580
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,050
Of course you don't.

581
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,610
Jerk.

582
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,690
Jerk?

583
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,210
Why do you keep dwelling on the past?

584
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,130
I'm not as petty and narrow-minded

585
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,170
as you are.

586
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,810
You would starve if you lived in your fantasy.

587
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,610
Sure.

588
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,530
I can survive.

589
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,370
Women are unreasonable.

590
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,050
It's because

591
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,810
no man is good in real life.

592
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,810
Say it again.

593
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,770
I'll say it again if you want to hear it.

594
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,770
Every man

595
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,210
is a jerk!

596
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,370
You just

597
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,210
scolded Ling Rui too.

598
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,490
Wonderful!

599
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,330
Did I scold you?

600
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,930
Even if I did, so what?

601
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,170
I'm not wrong.

602
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,370
He is always so unpredictable.

603
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,290
Our Ms. Lu,

604
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,370
a cool and brave woman,

605
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,530
is living under his torment!

606
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,210
I'm not. I'm fine.

607
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,130
Stop using Ling Rui

608
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,450
as an excuse.

609
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,290
What about her?

610
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,850
She left without a word six years ago.

611
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,850
She even kept the son

612
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,410
she had given birth to a secret.

613
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,850
What's wrong with him being upset?

614
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,130
I'm fine too.

615
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,450
What's so great about Dr. Ling?

616
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,050
He didn't say anything and

617
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:54,650
refused to go to

618
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,130
Germany?

619
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,410
He took action before informing.

620
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,170
What's the difference between that

621
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,050
and what Ms. Lu has done?

622
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,890
Didn't he know

623
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,250
it would be a huge burden in her heart

624
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,930
once she knew about it?

625
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,330
Ling Rui had stayed with Fangning

626
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,650
when she had a hard time.

627
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,730
What he did was for her good.

628
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,370
That was your wishful thinking.

629
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,610
No one asked him to do so.

630
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,130
Ms. Lu donated so much money

631
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,330
to that institute.

632
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,520
Because she didn't want Dr. Ling

633
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,730
to sacrifice everything for her.

634
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,970
She did it for his good!

635
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,010
Women are just as terrible

636
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,850
with their wishful thinking.

637
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,240
Okay, let's not talk about the past.

638
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,290
Let's talk about the present.

639
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,530
We talk about it every day.

640
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,450
It's always the same thing.

641
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,490
It's always an apology.

642
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,970
What's the point of apologizing?

643
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,250
Why didn't she ask

644
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,050
Ling Rui whether

645
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,370
he still felt the same for her?

646
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,730
She was jealous,

647
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,450
then she pushed him away.

648
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,540
She is paranoid and hesitant.

649
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,170
Ling Rui was worried

650
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,770
she would leave, then he feared

651
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,520
she would be

652
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,650
reluctant to stay.

653
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,570
Why couldn't she

654
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,650
make things more subtle?

655
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,210
I...

656
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,890
As expected, only men understand men.

657
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,570
You don't understand women's

658
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,330
sensitive and fragile hearts at all.

659
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,850
Our Ms. Lu did this

660
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,530
because she didn't want Dr. Ling

661
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,770
to stay with her unwillingly

662
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,610
for the sake of the kid

663
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,090
and affect his life! Fool!

664
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,370
Fine. Fine.

665
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,250
I'll argue about

666
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,050
these trivial matters.

667
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,930
If you said so,

668
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,690
why not just make it clear?

669
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,810
Ling Rui just wants to hear one thing.

670
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,330
Why doesn't he say it first?

671
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,650
Ms. Lu also wants to hear

672
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,080
those three words?

673
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,610
Enough.

674
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,010
That's enough.

675
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,090
[Is Ms. Lu going to end my life?]

676
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,330
Cai Siyu.

677
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,250
If you have something to say, say it to my face.

678
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,650
I told her to say

679
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,690
what she said earlier.

680
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,010
We've made everything clear just now.

681
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,170
You two should have a good chat.

682
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,690
Sim...

683
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,690
Simon.

684
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,410
Would you like some coffee?

685
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,770
Would you like some water?

686
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,970
-I don't want any.
-I'm not thirsty either.

687
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,650
-Sit down.
-We should sit down first.

688
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,900
Take a seat.

689
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,650
-This isn't our home.
-This isn't our home.

690
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,210
Slow down. Slow down.

691
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,730
You almost gave me a heart attack.

692
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,330
It was horrible.

693
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,530
Well,

694
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,130
thank you.

695
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,770
You're welcome.

696
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,760
I was glad to help.

697
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,050
Just now I...

698
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,930
Well,

699
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,330
these are different matters.

700
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,420
I know.

701
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,570
Okay, then I'll send you home.

702
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,170
[What should I do?] [Should I let him send me home?]

703
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,280
[Will I fall into his trap again?]

704
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,649
I planned it all.

705
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,609
Don't blame her.

706
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,410
It's okay.

707
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,280
Go upstairs.

708
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,089
Where to?

709
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,970
Simon,

710
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:33,760
this is your home.

711
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,970
My home.

712
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
Okay, then I'll send her home first.

713
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Never mind.

714
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,770
I'll go back by myself.

715
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,129
You are drunk, so you can't drive.

716
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,320
Well, let's go home and rest well.

717
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,970
Good night, bye.

718
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,210
Good night.

719
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,250
Well,

720
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,050
we should

721
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,410
go home.

722
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,050
It seems like

723
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,330
there's something

724
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,050
we haven't finished.

725
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:29,970
We should pick Youyou up!

726
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,130
Yeah. We should pick him up. Let's go!

727
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,330
[We talk about it every day.]

728
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,650
[It's always the same thing.]

729
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,650
[It's always an apology.]

730
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,170
[What's the point of apologizing?]

731
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,130
Why didn't she ask

732
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,770
Ling Rui whether

733
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,450
he still felt the same

734
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,730
for her?

735
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,210
She was jealous,

736
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,970
then she pushed him away.

737
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,970
She is paranoid and hesitant.

738
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,170
[Why couldn't she]

739
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,570
[make things more subtle?]

740
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,450
Did I cause the misunderstanding?

741
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,180
It's impossible.

742
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,490
It's rare for me to

743
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,770
be so considerate and willing

744
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,290
to sacrifice my own interests.

745
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,050
Mom,

746
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,130
when you're done,

747
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,650
can you help me to brush mine?

748
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,450
Thank you.

749
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,370
Mom,

750
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,650
your teeth.

751
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,330
[Since we said so,]

752
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,050
[let's make it clear.]

753
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,210
[Ling Rui just wants to hear one thing.]

754
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,010
What does he want to hear from me?

755
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,530
They should have made it clear.

756
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,970
They almost got to the point,

757
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,570
why did I tell them to shut up?

758
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,530
Unbelievable.

759
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,890
[Fangning hasn't made her stance.]

760
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,770
[So this is what she was concerned about.]

761
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,970
[Now that I think about it,]

762
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,770
[what I did was a little inconsiderate.]

763
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,970
[I was wrong six years ago.]

764
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,610
[I'm still wrong even now.]

765
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,010
Dad,

766
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,050
help me brush my teeth.

767
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,170
Dad,

768
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,730
are you also ignoring me?

769
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,890
[I'm a man.]

770
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,010
[In any case,]

771
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,490
[I need to apologize first.]

772
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,610
I'm sorry.

773
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,530
It's okay, Dad.

774
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,610
I won't blame you.

775
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,290
It seems like

776
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,610
I need to find a good time.

777
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,370
I'm...

778
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,650
I'm making the bed. I'm done.

779
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,050
One for each of us.

780
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,850
Yeah.

781
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,530
Well.

782
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,290
Fangning.

783
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,130
Actually,

784
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,290
just one.

785
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,760
What?

786
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,530
One...one blanket is enough.

787
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,410
What do you mean?

788
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,250
One blanket is enough.

789
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,650
What? What do you mean

790
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,490
one blanket is enough?

791
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,290
Why?

792
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,330
Why for what?

793
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,060
Why is one blanket enough?

794
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,290
Because...

795
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,970
It's cold.

796
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,130
-It's not cold. It's warm.
-It's not cold.

797
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,600
I think

798
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,210
it's getting a little warm.

799
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,530
Well,

800
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,610
then I...

801
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,690
I will take this blanket away.

802
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,770
Okay.

803
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,330
Let's go to bed.

804
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:13,970
Okay.

805
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,290
It's weird.

806
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,970
Mom and dad aren't acting normally.

807
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,730
One brushed her teeth repeatedly.

808
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,530
One cleaned the house repeatedly.

809
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,730
Life is tough for me.

810
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,730
[Is this the right time?]

811
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,770
[What is it]

812
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,130
[that he wants to hear?]

813
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,410
Ling Rui,

814
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,250
you're still awake?

815
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,570
How about you?

816
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,850
Are you tired after the long day?

817
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,050
I am...

818
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,490
Youyou.

819
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,570
Youyou.

820
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,330
Mom, Dad,

821
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,770
you've been bonding for several days.

822
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,130
I also want to join you

823
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,330
for the bonding.

824
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,770
-Okay.
-Come on.

825
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,170
Come.

826
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,650
Come.

827
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,250
Come.

828
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,170
Come on.

829
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,610
Okay, now sleep tight.

830
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,730
Okay, let's sleep.

831
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,090
Come on.

832
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,970
Breakfast is ready.

833
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,730
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

834
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,600
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

835
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,810
-Good morning, mom and dad.
-Good morning.

836
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,440
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

837
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,180
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

838
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,660
What a great breakfast today!

839
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,770
Try it out.

840
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,730
I like it very much.

841
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,570
Youyou,

842
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,930
after breakfast,

843
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,250
we'll clean the dishes

844
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,330
and go to

845
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,770
Grandma's house, okay?

846
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,730
Okay.

847
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,490
Fangning,

848
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,330
how about

849
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,210
having lunch together later?

850
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,050
I need to have a word with you.

851
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,130
I also have something to tell you.

852
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:28,970
Hello?

853
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,810
Okay, okay, I'll be there at once.

854
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,610
Youyou,

855
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,250
have an onion ring.

856
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,290
What's wrong?

857
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,010
Mr. Cao called me.

858
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,610
He wanted to see me and it sounded urgent.

859
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,170
Maybe it's

860
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,290
about moving in.

861
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,610
Things should be fine.

862
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,570
I'll get prepared.

863
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,050
By the way,

864
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,570
I ran into Gao Erfan

865
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,770
in the park yesterday.

866
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,650
I think he knows

867
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,010
you've returned to open a store.

868
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,970
I'll be careful.

869
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,050
I must get going.

870
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,090
Finish your breakfast.

871
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm going to change my clothes.

872
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,830
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

873
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,050
When we're free later,

874
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,370
I'll run this

875
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,330
by you again.

876
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,210
Okay.

877
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,530
Don't worry about the rest.

878
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,380
Back to your work.

879
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,090
Hello, Miss Pingping?

880
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,250
Hello?

881
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,170
Let's meet up.

882
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,690
I want you to meet someone.

883
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,650
A man.

884
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,730
He is important

885
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,600
to both you

886
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,970
and me.

887
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,570
A man?

888
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,370
An important person that I must meet?

889
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,450
Miss Pingping,

890
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,810
are you in love?

891
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,970
As your big fan,

892
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,970
for the sake of your acting career,

893
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,490
I will definitely make the final check.

894
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,690
No problem.

895
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,050
She is introducing her boyfriend

896
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,210
to her boyfriend?

897
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,810
Then why does she think of me?

898
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,410
Hello.

899
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,090
Go ask Lu Fangning instead.

900
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,690
Do you want to

901
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,730
tell Lu Fangning about us?

902
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,290
I've badmouthed her

903
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,050
the other day.

904
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,370
Is she going to

905
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,330
rat me out?

906
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,370
Okay.

907
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,250
I'll be there.

908
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,250
Great.

909
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,290
A boyfriend check.

910
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,450
A boyfriend check.

911
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,290
My two boyfriends.
