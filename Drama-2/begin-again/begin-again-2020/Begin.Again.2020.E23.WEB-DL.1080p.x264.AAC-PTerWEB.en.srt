[Episode 23]

4
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,929
Morning.

5
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,010
Morning.

6
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,200
It seems like it's not early anymore.

7
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,560
To me, you're not late.

8
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm leaving. Thank you, Director Lu.

9
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,250
Aargh!

10
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,760
Last night...

11
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,120
I...

12
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,370
We...

13
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,450
We...

14
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,520
We...

15
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
We were drunk?

16
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
We drank a little too much.

17
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,400
Yes, it was a little too much.

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,450
But...

19
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,240
How did we end up at a hotel?

20
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,770
Why do you ask me about this?

21
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,250
How do I know what was going on?

22
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,680
I was drunk anyway.

23
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,890
I don't remember anything after falling asleep.

24
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,240
Anyway...

25
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,290
I fell asleep, too.

26
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,720
Who knows if you

27
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
sleepwalked?

28
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,170
I...

29
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
Lu Yiyao, enough said.

30
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm leaving if you still act like this.

31
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,570
I just want to figure out,

32
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,920
did anything happen

33
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,330
between us

34
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,530
last night?

35
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,250
No

36
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,730
or yes?

37
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't you know in your heart

38
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,650
if something happened or not?

39
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,650
Lu Yiyao, you...

40
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,440
Lu Yiyao.

41
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,120
If you asked me like this again,

42
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
then I wouldn't care about being disgraceful.

43
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,840
I'll tell the whole world

44
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,930
everything that we did.

45
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,010
Let's see if I dare to do so.

46
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,480
As you said, LM Deer Sing Group has indeed

47
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,810
encountered a huge crisis.

48
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,240
But if this hadn't happened,

49
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,170
I'd never have considered

50
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,240
your investment.

51
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,480
Ms. Lu is always so straightforward.

52
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,450
I believe that Mr. Zheng, you would understand

53
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,890
even if I didn't say this out.

54
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,810
You can just regard this as buying

55
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,490
an opportunity to make money with LM Deer Sing Group.

56
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Okay.

57
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,650
I will.

58
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,650
Ms. Lu,

59
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,600
then I'll make a move now.

60
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,680
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

61
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,400
Mr. Zheng, let me show you the way out.

62
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,120
Mr. Zheng.

63
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
I hope that I'll have the opportunity

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,410
to learn from you.

65
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,920
Of course.

66
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay, goodbye.

67
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,560
Hello, everyone!

68
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,800
My darlings.

69
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,280
Today, I'm here

70
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,090
at the LM Deer Sing Home Furnishing Store again.

71
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,609
Let's check out

72
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,410
what will be introduced today.

73
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,920
This couch is really...

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
It's really very comfortable.

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,609
It's even more comfortable than the one at my home.

76
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
The smell is also very refreshing.

77
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,530
There's no smell of formaldehyde.

78
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,120
Smelling like formaldehyde? That's a lie.

79
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,530
Don't you believe

80
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,640
those online marketing accounts

81
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,520
hyping there.

82
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
I think that...

83
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,250
This couch

84
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,050
smells as good as

85
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,040
chocolate.

86
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,040
I love it so much.

87
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,210
What should I do?

88
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,050
Guys,

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,130
add it to your cart now, okay?

90
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,850
Such a fool.

91
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,530
I want to take it home.

92
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,480
I love it.

93
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,490
A chocolate-flavored couch.

94
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
What kind of description is this?

95
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,050
Isn't she hostile to Ms. Lu?

96
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,530
How come she

97
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,720
speaks in LM Deer Sing Group's favor now?

98
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,040
She's offering help in its hour of need?

99
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,000
This lady is quite interesting.

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,650
She looks pretty cute.

101
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,570
Peng Bo.

102
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,290
Help me stop Professor Luo.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,890
Stop him.

104
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,090
Ling Rui.

105
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,550
-Ling Rui.
-Professor, are you looking for me?

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,600
[Doctor's office]

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
Why am I looking for you? Where's Ling Rui?

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,520
Ling Rui is not here.

109
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,640
I see.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,730
Don't think that

111
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,800
after avoiding Mr. Luo, you'll be all right.

112
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,640
You've yet to talk

113
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,250
to your wife, right?

114
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,810
Say something, bro.

115
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,930
You're not talking again.

116
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,560
Say something.

117
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,600
What do you think of this report?

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,009
Just do it according to

119
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,009
what I told you before.

120
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,530
Didn't I explain to you clearly?

121
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,570
Got it.

122
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,759
Understood.

123
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,129
Professor Luo.

124
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,440
You may leave now.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,560
You're here to collect your medicine?

126
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes.

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
You can just come to me next time.

128
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,410
You're also in charge of the pharmacy now?

129
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,160
No.

130
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I mean that if your son

131
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,480
is too busy to accompany you next time,

132
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,210
I'll take care of you

133
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,730
when you need something.

134
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
Don't say this.

135
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
How dare I trouble you,

136
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,250
Professor Luo?

137
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,400
You shouldn't have.

138
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,840
I don't know

139
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,810
what Ling Rui

140
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,760
is up to nowadays.

141
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,370
Has he bought a flight ticket?

142
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,770
Has he booked a hotel?

143
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,960
He didn't even tell me

144
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,130
when he'll leave.

145
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,520
Where is he going?

146
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,930
He's going to Germany to further his studies.

147
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,160
He's already got the offer letter.

148
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Didn't he tell you?

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,050
He even got the offer letter?

150
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,680
Ling Rui...

151
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,090
There's nothing here.

152
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,920
What is exactly

153
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,650
all this?

154
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,450
Mom.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,320
Didn't you ask me to come home to cook?

156
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,930
Where are my aunts?

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,640
It's none of your business

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
to care about their whereabouts.

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,440
You didn't tell me anything.

160
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,320
Mom.

161
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,800
Let me tell you a piece of good news.

162
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,250
I got an offer letter

163
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,130
from the German Institute.

164
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,850
I...

165
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,570
Does Fangning know about it?

166
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,570
How can I just leave

167
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
when LM Deer Sing Group is in this state now?

168
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
I don't know how to tell her about this.

169
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,520
What a pity

170
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,210
if you're not going.

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't worry.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
I've asked a friend

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,280
to contact the person

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,450
who is in charge of this in Germany

175
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,640
to see if it can be

176
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
deferred, via

177
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,800
a video call.

178
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
If there's a turnaround for LM Deer Sing Group,

179
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,890
then everything

180
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,770
is going to be fine, right?

181
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm not forcing you

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,250
to make any decision.

183
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,080
I just want to remind you.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
Don't make

185
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,200
Mom.

186
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,090
a decision that'll make you regret it.

187
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,920
-Mom.
-That's such an incredible opportunity.

188
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,290
Don't worry.

189
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,480
I cherish this opportunity very much.

190
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,600
I won't miss it.

191
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,200
[Done. You can thank me now.]

192
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,650
[Thank you.]

193
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,130
Okay.

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Okay.

195
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,330
No problem.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Okay.

197
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,570
I know it.

198
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,240
Thank you.

199
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,160
Goodbye.

200
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,570
There's good news?

201
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,240
Mr. Zheng has already

202
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,040
agreed to invest.

203
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
They'll confirm the details

204
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
of the contract with me immediately.

205
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,970
I want to let Gao Erfan do the follow-up.

206
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,770
We can hold a board meeting

207
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,850
this afternoon.

208
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,410
Do we still need to wait

209
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,720
to sign the contract?

210
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,850
We can't wait any longer.

211
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
LM Deer Sing Group will suffer more losses

212
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,290
if we continue waiting.

213
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,490
The LM Deer Sing Group today

214
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,480
can't wait anymore.

215
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,410
Okay.

216
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,480
Simon.

217
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,720
Simon.

218
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Are you okay?

219
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,960
I know that

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,880
many things happened in the company of late.

221
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,250
You might be feeling very stressed.

222
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,400
You need to lift your spirits

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
particularly during this period of time.

224
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,610
Keep it up.

225
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,000
Keep it up.

226
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,690
Convening a board meeting?

227
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,600
Why are we having

228
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,280
the meeting now?

229
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,520
It's better to make things clear

230
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,890
by holding a press conference.

231
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,440
They should hurry up

232
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,000
and deny LM Deer Sing Group's responsibility for that.

233
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Mr. Li.

234
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,040
Mr. Yang, let me answer the call.

235
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,010
You go in first.

236
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,970
Hello.

237
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,730
Okay, I got it.

238
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,750
[LM Deer Sing Group]

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,810
Did I hear it right, Fangning?

240
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
You mean that

241
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,170
LM Deer Sing Group will compensate for

242
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,250
all those unqualified products,

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
even for those that

244
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
we're not sure if there's any problem?

245
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,330
As long as any customer requests a refund,

246
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,680
LM Deer Sing Group will agree?

247
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,120
Yes.

248
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,160
Don't you think you did too much

249
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,610
for the public relations crisis?

250
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,250
These are the problems

251
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,600
of the brands which were brought into LM Deer Sing Store.

252
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,880
Why does LM Deer Sing Group need to be held responsible

253
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,850
for all the losses?

254
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,400
Right?

255
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,470
Yes.

256
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,730
-Yes, it's unreasonable.
-Yes.

257
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,560
Why should we be held responsible for the refunds?

258
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,320
Every board director here

259
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,120
has been with LM Deer Sing Group for so long.

260
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,040
You know for sure that

261
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,320
the problems are with the brands,

262
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
but not us.

263
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,840
But customers

264
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,770
won't think so.

265
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,010
They'll just think that

266
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,320
LM Deer Sing Home Furnishing Store

267
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,840
can't even guarantee

268
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,040
the quality of its products

269
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,160
although it keeps boasting that they're eco-friendly.

270
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,130
If we can't win

271
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,130
our consumers back,

272
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,370
they'll never

273
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,760
step into LM Deer Sing Store again.

274
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,080
It'll also bring

275
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,970
a very serious impact

276
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,210
to our own brands.

277
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,760
I understand what you mean.

278
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,840
But isn't it too extreme

279
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,320
to handle it in your way?

280
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,130
It's way too extreme.

281
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,490
I know, and I understand.

282
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,810
But regaining consumers' trust

283
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,680
is essentially an

284
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,930
insurmountable challenge.

285
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,120
Everybody,

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,130
LM Deer Sing Group's stock price has been plummeting

287
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,440
since yesterday.

288
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,450
If we don't adopt an extreme method

289
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,490
immediately

290
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,970
to regain LM Deer Sing Group's credibility,

291
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,970
everything will be too late

292
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,960
when the stock price

293
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,890
has bottomed.

294
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,850
It can't drop anymore.

295
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
I

296
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,210
just have one question.

297
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,890
The refunds that we are paying

298
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,450
on behalf of the factories

299
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,840
are a massive amount of money.

300
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,960
May I ask,

301
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,000
where does the money come from?

302
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,460
If you want to use

303
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,910
LM Deer Sing Group's circulating capital

304
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,860
to fill the void,

305
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,440
then how are we going

306
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,330
to keep LM Deer Sing Group running in the future?

307
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,160
I still remember that recently,

308
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,860
our company has a bank loan

309
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,770
which needs to be repaid.

310
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,250
I have calculated.

311
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,190
The projects that are currently

312
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,840
run by our company

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,740
won't be

314
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,850
affected at all.

315
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,330
As for the bank loan,

316
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,650
I've found

317
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,600
a new investor.

318
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,650
Is it?

319
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,040
Is it reliable?

320
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,600
Fangning,

321
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,040
if your investment doesn't work,

322
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
then just let it be.

323
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,970
I happen to have a few investors here

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
who have always wanted to invest in LM Deer Sing Group.

325
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,250
You can discuss

326
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,000
this with them right away.

327
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,650
I've also contacted the brands' manufacturers.

328
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,490
They're willing to

329
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,400
make refunds for

330
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,440
the defective products.

331
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,120
They're also in favor

332
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,600
of our payment plan.

333
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,080
As long as they have enough

334
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,250
funds to make the refunds,

335
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,130
LM Deer Sing Group's advance payment

336
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,170
can be recollected.

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,890
Everyone,

338
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,090
now is the critical moment

339
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,370
to rebuild LM Deer Sing Group's reputation.

340
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,530
We want everyone to understand that

341
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,040
LM Deer Sing Group

342
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,600
doesn't care about the gains nor losses at a particular period of time

343
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,920
because LM Deer Sing Group

344
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,370
will definitely sustain

345
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,640
and grow for good.

346
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,920
-It makes sense.
-What he said makes sense.

347
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,760
Yes.

348
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,040
I agree with General Manager Lu's suggestion.

349
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,650
Since Ms. Lu

350
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,650
has already given her assurance,

351
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,280
then

352
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,720
I don't have any questions now.

353
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,130
I support Lu Fangning's decision.

354
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,320
I stand by her.

355
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,890
That's the only way.

356
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,490
We'll wait until the stock price rises.

357
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,220
[LM Deer Sing Group officially announced today that]

358
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,730
[it'll accept returns for Hanping and Leqi's]

359
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,660

[by making an appointment.]

369
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,960
[LM Deer Sing Group will suffer a massive loss]

370
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,560
[The way of handling refunds]

371
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,430
[due to this action.]

372
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,690
A massive loss.

373
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,870
[A massive loss.]

374
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,019
The strategy of making refunds

375
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:16,900
has already had an effect.

376
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,830
Public opinion is slowly in favor of LM Deer Sing Group.

377
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,850
The customer flow at LM Deer Sing Store

378
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,900
has also gradually increased.

379
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,200
The first challenge has been overcome.

380
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,309
As we expected,

381
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,700
the cash flow for refunds

382
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,750

573
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,590
to celebrate your birthday with you.

574
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,550
But if you didn't

575
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,520
ask her to go back...

576
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,610
You tell me.

577
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,060
Why would she die?

578
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,110
You should be

579
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,880
feeling guilty

580
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,050
and agonized over her death forever.

581
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,940
And bearing in mind at all times

582
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,410
that you killed her.

583
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,490
If it wasn't because

584
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,690
of your selfishness and naivety,

585
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,030
we'd have lived

586
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,850
our own lives

587
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,880
a long time ago.

588
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,140
But now...

589
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,460
You thought you founded

590
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,470
Infinity

591
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
and that was an act of atonement?

592
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,530
Listen, you don't deserve to do so.

593
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,430
You

594
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,440
don't deserve

595
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,740
to fulfill Lu Yue's wish for her.

596
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,200
So

597
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,940
you came to LM Deer Sing Group three years ago

598
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,250
and applied to be my assistant

599
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,940
just for all of this today,

600
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,900
right?

601
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,660
Yes.

602
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,180
I took

603
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,240
three years

604
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,120
to stay by your side

605
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,420
and made this happen.

606
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,970
If you didn't insist

607
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,730
on establishing Infinity,

608
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,650
perhaps I wouldn't

609
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,290
get this opportunity so soon.

610
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,770
The more you wanted

611
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,690
to build Infinity,

612
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,250
the more you'd eager for instant success.

613
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,550
Then it'd make LM Deer Sing Group

614
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,980
more vulnerable.

615
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,160
So anyway,

616
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,250
I had to make sure your plan

617
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,430
was rolled out smoothly,

618
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,610
then used it

619
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,270
to drag down LM Deer Sing Group.

620
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,870
In the beginning,

621
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,960
there'll indeed be some

622
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,010
cash flow pressure,

623
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,940
but after the first batch

624
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,610
of products is launched,

625
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,120
this issue will be alleviated soon.

626
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,340
A few cash flow problems

627
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,850
have also happened before,

628
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,360
but Ms. Lu resolved them smoothly.

629
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,540
Not to mention that

630
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,180
Ms. Lu is here now.

631
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,190
I don't think we need

632
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,280
to worry too much.

633
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,750
Mr. Zheng.

634
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,390
I hope that I'll have the opportunity

635
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,740
to learn from you.

636
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,820
So you've done all of this?

637
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,990
Yes.

638
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,070
Even Mr. Li's

639
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,410
approval of your

640
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,260
compensation agreement

641
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,530
was also instigated by me.

642
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,540
I also didn't expect that everything

643
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,930
would go so smoothly.

644
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,450
Do you know it? Lu Fangning.

645
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,130
If you insisted

646
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,180
on letting those manufacturers

647
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,780
to pay for the refunds as a compensation,

648
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,090
LM Deer Sing Group might still have a bit of a chance

649
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,860
to survive and won't collapse in such a short time.

650
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,550
You were so selfish before

651
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,190
and would never take risks

652
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,580
all by yourself.

653
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,100
So what changed you?

654
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,310
I think it's Dr. Ling.

655
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,050
If that's the case,

656
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,400
then I have to thank him.

657
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,990
After all, he changed you,

658
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,090
and that gave me such a good opportunity.

659
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,900
Unfortunately,

660
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm afraid you wouldn't want

661
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,930
to thank him as I do.

662
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,150
I actually hesitated before.

663
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
It was just that Fangyu's incident

664
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,140
proved to me again that

665
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,540
your family

666
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,640
isn't worthy

667
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,980
of my sympathy.

668
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
So?

669
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,300
You're now

670
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,940
LM Deer Sing Group's largest shareholder.

671
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,540
What do you want to do next?

672
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,970
What do I want to do?

673
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,830
The person I love the most in my life

674
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,900
was ruined by you.

675
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,540
Then similarly,

676
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,780
I'll ruin

677
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,830
you and LM Deer Sing Group

678
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,400
all together.

679
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,500
All.

680
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,080
Hello, Ling.

681
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,890
Hi, Professor.

682
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,120
Nice to meet you. All right.

683
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,130
Let's start now.

684
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,060
Okay.

685
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,610
The first thing

686
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,160
I'd like to start

687
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,470
is looking at your research direction.

688
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,340
I've been conducting a medical study

689
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,300
on the

690
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,900
early drainage tube

691
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,920
removed after Whipple

692
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,060
for pancreatic cancer.

693
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,220
That's a good consideration.

694
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,830
We performed at our operation last week.

695
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,600
The patient had a recurrence of a pancreatic cancer

696
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,580
two years after surgery.

697
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,480
So what we did is...

698
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,160
Excuse me, sorry.

699
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,670
Ling Rui.

700
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
Fangning.

701
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,120
Sorry, Professor.

702
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,890
Hello?

703
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,460
What happened just over there?

704
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,010
I don't know.

705
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,170
[LM Deer Sing Group]

706
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,270
Drink some water.

707
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,000
Thank you.

708
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,640
Is it really Mr. Gao?

709
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Yes.

710
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,859
He was my sister's

711
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:32,910
boyfriend.

712
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,230
He wanted

713
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,210
to avenge my sister, so...

714
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,240
At least

715
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,129
there's someone in this world

716
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:46,930
who misses Lu Yue

717
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:49,660
so much, just like you.

718
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,600
Do you think that

719
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,540
my sister would be happy

720
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,430
if she knew it?

721
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,740
No.

722
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,020
No matter how much

723
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,450
she hated her family,

724
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,180
she wouldn't want it to disappear completely.

725
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,940
Not to mention that

726
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,040
you're still here.

727
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,540
All of this

728
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,680
is Gao Erfan's own decision.

729
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,110
It has nothing to do with Lu Yue.

730
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,810
You need to defeat him

731
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,740
and win LM Deer Sing Group back.

732
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,750
You must show him absolutely no mercy.

733
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,300
Fangning.

734
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,360
You've been doing very well.

735
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,180
I'll always be by your side.

736
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,670
Hello, Ling Rui.

737
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,310
What's the matter?

738
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,570
Why did you run away just now?

739
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm sorry.

740
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,810
I can't make it.
