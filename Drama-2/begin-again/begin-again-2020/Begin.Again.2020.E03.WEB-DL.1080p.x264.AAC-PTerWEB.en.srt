[Episode 03]

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,890
By the way,

5
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,280
did you put the drugs on the nightstand?

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,080
You should know

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,480
I made an appointment with Lu Fangning,

8
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,280
right here at the penthouse.

9
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,970
I'll grab a bottle of wine before I go up.

10
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,040
And let her have a "taste".

11
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Ms. Lu.

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,880
Ms. Lu.

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Are you alright?

14
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,560
Why are you here?

15
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,320
It hurts.

16
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,800
The person who can bully me

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,970
has not been born yet.

18
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,240
You are overconfident.

19
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,320
Even if you can solve it this time,

20
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
can you guarantee that

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
you can always protect yourself?

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,210
I always

23
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,430
protect myself.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Everything the bastard said just now

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
has been recorded on my phone.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,730
If he dares do anything to me,

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,210
I'll make sure to sue him,

28
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,160
until he goes bankrupt and goes to jail.

29
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,200
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
You worry about me.

32
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,880
What's wrong?

33
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,920
It's just gastric pain.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Judging from how you look,

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
you should go to the hospital.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,200
I'll send you.

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,080
It's okay.

38
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,170
I've work to do later.

39
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,080
It'll be gone in a while.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,360
You're in so much pain.

41
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,240
How are you going to work?

42
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:48,000
Leave.

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't need your help.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Okay.

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
You don't want my help.

46
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,640
Then, I'll call 120
and that's none of your business too.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
I am not your patient.

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't need you

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
to make decisions and arrangements for me.

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm sorry

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,960
about what I said.

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,719
If you really want to help me,

53
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,000
can you

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,640
send me somewhere?

55
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
This is something

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
very important to me.

57
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,710
Thank you.

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't eat raw or cold food.

59
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,200
I know.

60
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
Thanks.

61
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Ms. Lu.

62
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
This restaurant serves good food.

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm glad that you like it.

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,680
Next time when you're here,

65
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
you can look for their manager.

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Just mention my name.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay, thank you.

68
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,330
You're welcome.

69
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,640
Is the car here?

70
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,480
The driver and the car are waiting.

71
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
Ms. Lu.

72
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm so sorry

73
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,800
that I wasn't of much help.

74
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,000
It's okay.

75
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,960
-See you.
-Bye.

76
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,450
Goodbye.

77
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,600
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Mr. Sun.

78
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
He really left.

79
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
It hurts so bad.

80
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,080
Ms. Lu.

81
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,690
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

82
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,210

♫ The wind passed through the window
and kissed me on my cheek ♫

84

♫ Asking gently, how are you? ♫

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,860
♫ The plane flew by and left a trail behind ♫

86
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,880
♫ Perhaps the sky wants to flash a smile ♫

87
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,180
♫ The softness in my heart was touched ♫

88
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Are you okay?

♫ The number of dreams
I've had since your departure ♫

Take care of your diet,
and seek timely medical attention.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,750
Thanks.

92
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,840
You're welcome.

93
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Ms. Lu.

94
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,600
I finally found you.

95
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,470
Thank you

96
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,440
for supporting our restaurant all this while.

97
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,600
We specially prepared

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
a small gift for you.

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,280
This is a wind chime.

100
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,560
I wish you

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,240
an everlasting love.

107
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,880
can you take me home?

108

♫ I listen to my heart ♫

109

♫ To hold you tight ♫

112
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Thank you.

113
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,640
I'll get you something to eat.

114
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't go.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,870
Also...

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
Do you want to stay the night?

117
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Stay with me.

118
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,920
What's going on?

119
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
What's going on?

120
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,790
You drank alcohol on an empty stomach.

121
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
Take some medicine.

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
This will more or less

123
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,560
give some side effects.

124
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
You'll feel better after throwing up.

125
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,720
I'll get you something to eat.

126
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,670
I've given you all my money.

127
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,560
I don't want it.

128
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,600
No.

129
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm not.

130
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
No.

131
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,440
Lu Fangning.

132
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,840
Are you okay?

133
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,560
Why are you still here?

134
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,040
I cooked some porridge.

135
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
You haven't eaten anything.

136
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,710
Do you want to eat something?

137
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,360
It's good for you.

138
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,000
Did you clean this?

139
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,200
I messed up your things.

141
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,070
But, it was...

142
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Porridge.

143
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Do I have a pot at home?

144
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,160
It's fresh. Try it.

145
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
Is there anything you can't do?

146
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,600
Delicious.

147
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Why are you still here?

148
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,240
Do you think

149
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,440
I look cute when I eat

150
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,680
and want to sneak a few more glances?

151
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,280
Drink your porridge quietly.

152
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
I listened to you,

153
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,520
and didn't eat anything raw and cold.

154
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
So, you only drank alcohol.

155
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,480
Lu Fangning, what do you want?

156
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,480
What do you mean

157
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,360
by sending this to me?

158
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,040
What did I do to you?

159
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
Make it clear.

160
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm telling you.

161
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
If you dare blackmail me...

162
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,230
I sent him the recording.

163
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,840
From now on,

164
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,600
you'll never get any vote

165
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
from the Yang Family anymore.

166
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Did you blackmail him?

167
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,230
Without the vote

168
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,710
from the Yang Family,

169
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,080
your proposal will

170
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
never be approved.

171
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,880
Don't stare at me like that.

172
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,560
And, me...

173
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
Although I really want to

174
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,760
publish the brand,

175
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,800
but I won't cooperate

176
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,960
with someone like him.

177
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,040
Bastard.

178
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,030
As you see,

179
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm doing something

180
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,800
that is

181
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
very, very,

182
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,600
very important to me.

183
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
It's not just about work.

184
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,720
This sounds ridiculous.

185
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,200
However,

186
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
if I can't get married right away,

187
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,360
all my efforts now

188
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,520
will be in vain.

189
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,400
I believe you.

190
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,750
You aren't someone who gives up easily.

191
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,460
But,

192
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,559
neither am I invincible.

193
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,080
Ling Rui,

194
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,360
you are an excellent doctor.

195
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,799
But, there must be

196
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,510
patients whom you want to save

197
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,200
but are incapable of saving.

198
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,510
There are things

199
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
you want to do,

200
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,880
but you can't.

201
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,990
Everyone has things they want to pursue.

202
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,640
Me too.

203
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,560
There are things

204
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,600
I want to pursue and protect.

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,160
So, I can sacrifice everything

206
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
and disregard what others think of me.

207
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,390
We know

208
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,800
what we're doing,

209
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,880
and that's enough.

210
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,180
I'm going to

211
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,080
attend a conference call.

212
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,160
Thanks for the porridge.

213
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
You're welcome.

214
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,510
You haven't changed.

215
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,920
Morning.

216
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,500
[Debtor, One-year Term]

217
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,200
One-year term.

218
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,720
Han, Meng.

219
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
You've gained weight.

220
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Ling Rui.

221
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Good morning, uncle.

222
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,790
You're playing chess.

223
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,280
Hi.

224
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,600
Why are you here?

225
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,550
Where did you go?

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,320
I bought breakfast.

227
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,160
What does the card mean?

228
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,640
Isn't that clear?

229
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,160
No, it's not clear enough.

230
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Businessmen like us,

231
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,550
want a clear-cut agreement.

232
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
Your words are too vague.

233
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,040
I don't know

234
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,150
what you actually think.

235
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,640
Well.

236
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,040
You look into my eyes now.

237
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Make it clear.

238
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,400
Tell me.

239
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,480
If you feel shy to look at me,

240
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,760
Then I won't stare at you.

241
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,280
Wait a minute.

242
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
Can I record a video?

243
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
So, I can take a look

244
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,150
at your expression later.

245
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Ling, are you out shopping?

246
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
Good morning, grandma.

247
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Good morning, grandma.

248
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,150
Say it.

249
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
There are so many people here.

250
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
-Say it.
-Good morning, Ling Rui.

251
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,720
Hi, Uncle Li.

252
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
Stop the greetings.

253
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,910
Just a few words.

254
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
Is it that difficult?

255
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
If you don't say it,

256
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,440
I won't know what you're thinking.

257
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,870
Say it.

258
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,480
Will you say it or not?

259
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,760
Do you want

260
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,560
marry me?

261
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,600
Follow me.

262
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,360
Mom, aunties,

263
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,080
she is...

264
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,040
Please allow Ling Rui

265
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,120
to sign a contract with me.

266
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,800
-Contract?
-Contract?

267
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,840
What she meant is...

268
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,720
I want him to sign

269
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,600
a contract that allows us
to keep each other company.

270
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,560
Isn't that a marriage?

271
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,840
It is a marriage.

272
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
A marriage?

273
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,430
Yes.

274
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,160
Excuse us. We need to discuss something.

275
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,760
I knew it was going to work.

276
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,680
Calm down.

277
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,120
This...

278
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,270
Why haven't I heard of it before?

279
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,280
What do you mean?

280
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
I think this girl is pretty good.

281
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,870
Sit down.

282
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,960
Just get married, then.

283
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,560
Why did you have to

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,360
beat around the bush?

285
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,600
Yes. Just get married.

286
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,760
Ling Rui is a great man.

287
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,440
-All of a sudden...
-Yes.

288
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,550
Ling Rui is a great man.

289
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,520
Don't worry.

290
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,800
I will definitely support him.

291
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll raise him into a well-fed,

292
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,040
and vigorous man.

293
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,520
Think about it.

294
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
Ling Rui is a great man.

295
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,080
There must be a lot of people who like him,

296
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,440
and desperate to bring him home.

297
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Bring him home?

298
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,440
Go home with him.

299
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,880
The market is a dangerous place

300
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,680
for a man like him.

301
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,440
So, someone like me,

302
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,350
who only has money,

303
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,600
and has to depend on him fully,

304
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
is the best for him.

305
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
Why did you say so much?

306
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,920
Don't worry.

307
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
She's rich.

308
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,760
But, she's too thin,

309
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,160
just like me when I was young.

310
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,120
You don't have to worry.

311
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,350
Don't be so old-fashioned.

312
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,040
Alright.

313
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,870
Okay.

314
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,080
I'll ask again.

315
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,800
Stay cool.

316
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,280
According to you,

317
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,680
you think Ling Rui

318
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,280
is a great guy too.

319
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,000
Of course.

320
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
A rare gem.

321
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,560
Young lady,

322
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
how long have you known each other?

323
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Do you know each other enough?

324
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
About five days.

325
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,880
Five days?

326
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
This is too fast.

327
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,360
Why did you have to tell them?

328
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,920
Calm down.

329
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,800
Why is she doing this?

330
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,680
Alright.

331
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,560
Alright.

332
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,400
I think

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,280
you have to ask this question.

334
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,080
Say it well.

335
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,320
-The time you've known each other...
-Hear me out.

336
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
That's true.

337
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,400
Five days

338
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,880
are already worth celebrating.

339
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,640
Lady, what's your name?

340
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I forgot to ask.

341
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
Sorry.

342
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,300
I forgot to introduce myself.

343
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
My name is Lu Fangning.

344
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,040
Lu Fangning?

345
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,920
What are you doing?

346
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,080
How can you be Lu Fangning?

347
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,360
Yes, I am the one

348
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,160
who grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth.

349
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,430
Currently,

350
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,400
I serve as the general manager
of LM Deer Sing Group.

351
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm in charge of the company as a whole.

352
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,200
Of course, in the near future,

353
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,750
the entire group will be mine.

354
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,800
Coincidentally, this cabinet

355
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,760
is a product of

356
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,120
our LM Deer Sing Group.

357
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,240
You can go have your discussion now.

358
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,800
We're not discussing anymore.

359
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,800
You are rich, right?

360
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Then...

361
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,080
-Do you have four million?
-Of course.

362
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,190
Ling Rui,

363
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,160
come with me.

364
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,640
Okay.

365
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,200
Mom.

366
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,120
Mom.

367
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,480
Stop.

368
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
Don't talk to me first.

369
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,360
I'll search for it.

370
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,800
I'll read it to you.

371
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,400
Selling yourself off for money.

372
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Let me read to you

373
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
what are the consequences.

374
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,880
Mom.

375
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,710
It's illegal to sell myself off.

376
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,240
You know you are breaking the law,

377
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,080
and you still go to her.

378
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,190
Mom.

379
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
I know what a marriage is.

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,790
Then, you're saying that

381
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,280
I don't know what a marriage is.

382
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,320
You've known each other only for a few days.

383
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,480
And, you're talking about getting married.

384
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,040
Is this a movie?

385
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,360
Mom.

386
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,760
Save it.

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,040
Don't speak nonsense.

388
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,200
Dare you say that

389
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
you love Ms. Lu?

390
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,560
Will you spend your time with her forever?

391
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,720
Tell me.

392
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:24,960
I...

393
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,360
I...

394
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll immediately mortgage this house.

395
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,720
Mom.

396
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,520
Listen to me.

397
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,480
For you,

398
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,520
our marriage

399
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,920
might be a hasty decision.

400
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
But, for us,

401
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,630
this is the best time.

402
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,960
You only met a few days ago.

403
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,480
It's short,

404
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
but it doesn't mean our marriage
will not last.

405
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,640
Am I right?

406
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
Five days

407
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,640
are enough for me to know her.

408
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,390
In fact,

409
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,200
we have known each other for a long time.

410
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
A long time?

411
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,600
Yes, a long time.

412
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,790
Only, she doesn't know it.

413
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,520
If you really want to

414
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,840
consider how long we've met.

415
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,200
Mom.

416
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Your grandson would've
gone to the elementary school already.

417
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,680
That's enough.

418
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
Are you kidding?

419
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,560
I'm not.

420
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,910
Listen.

421
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,520
Say it.

422
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,520
I'm no longer a kid.

423
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,200
I know

424
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,840
many things

425
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,720
can be traded with money.

426
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,200
But, I think

427
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,790
the feelings between two people

428
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
can never be traded.

429
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,960
For now,

430
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,000
she is almost a stranger to me.

431
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,960
But, I want to spend more time

432
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
learning about her.

433
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
You want to know more about her?

434
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,680
Silly boy,

435
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
isn't this love?

436
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,200
Why were you

437
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,760
too embarrassed to say it?

438
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,400
If you've said it earlier...

439
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Mom...

440
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,360
Will mom disapprove of you?

441
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,920
Mom.

442
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,870
You're right.

443
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,160
I know you're reluctant to let me go.

444
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,430
But, please believe me.

445
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm willing

446
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,590
to marry her.

447
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,470
It's by will?

448
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,920
I swear.

449
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
I want to marry her

450
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,840
by my own will.

451
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,840
-You even dare to swear?
-It hurts.

452
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,190
Do you want to

453
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,440
move into her house immediately,

454
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
and take her last name?

455
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
The next time I see you,

456
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,800
I'll call you Mr. Lu.

457
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,750
Is it? Is it?

458
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,120
-Heartless brat.
-Mom, it hurts.

459
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,840
You're heartless.

460
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,720
Mom.

461
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,560
Silly boy.

462
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Did you eat well?

463
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,390
Yes.

464
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,230
I haven't felt this way for a long time.

465
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,200
Don't you usually eat breakfast?

466
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,430
I only have a cup of coffee.

467
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,320
You should eat breakfast
if your stomach is not good,

468
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
not just a cup of coffee.

469
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,200
Yes.

470
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,560
The agreement between us

471
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,440
is progressing smoothly.

472
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,480
I am very happy.

473
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,190
What about your family?

474
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,800
I will notify them.

475
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,160
Before we sign the agreement,

476
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,440
I still have something to do.

477
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,920
I will also notify you then.

478
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,920
Anyway, after today,

479
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,520
I've become confident

480
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,440
to meet others' parents.

481
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,760
How about this?

482
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
I'll drop you at the hospital.

483
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,640
You go and change now.

484
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,320
I'll wait for you here.

485
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,830
It's okay.

486
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,560
Your car is too conspicuous.

487
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,030
We can't drive this to the hospital.

488
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,200
I'll go back first.

489
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,160
Wait.

490
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,880
What are you doing?

491
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
We have to get used to

492
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
intimate acts like this.

493
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,800
Just stay for three seconds.

494
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,280
One.

495
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,440
Two.

496
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,800
Two!

497
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,680
Three.

498
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Alright.

499
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,000
-I'll go now.
-Off you go.

500
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
-Good morning, boss.
-Morning.

501
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,360
If there's a douche with the last name Yang

502
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,120
come looking for me today,

503
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,800
regardless of age,

504
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,270
I'm neither meeting them,
nor picking up their calls.

505
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,240
Okay.

506
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,120
Also,

507
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,360
inform Lu Fangyu that

508
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll get him a new credit card.

509
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,800
Thank you, boss.

510
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,520
Why did you thank me?

511
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,480
Yes,

512
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,510
why am I doing that?

513
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,120
I like the scent

514
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,840
of your hairspray today.

515
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,640
There's even a heart-shaped fringe.

516
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,560
Good job. Keep it up.

517
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,440
Thanks, boss.

518
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,360
Boss, what do you think

519
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,960
about my seasonal award?

520
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,670
Get lost.

521
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,160
Okay.

522
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,280
I'm looking for Fangning.

523
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,640
No, Mr. Yang.

524
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,270
Please wait.

525
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,080
-Fangning.
-Mr. Yang.

526
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
-Fangning.
-Mr. Yang.

527
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,510
Fangning.

528
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,640
Ms. Lu, he...

529
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
What's up?

530
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,360
Mr. Yang is here.

531
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,600
Why didn't you inform me in advance?

532
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,430
Huh?

533
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
Have you served him coffee?

534
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,440
Not yet, right?

535
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,800
Look at you.

536
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,600
I'll deduct your bonus for the month.

537
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,520
You can leave now.

538
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,150
Yes.

539
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:02,880
Have a seat.

540
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,790
I wonder

541
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,840
why Mr. Yang is here.

542
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,230
Let Yang Ming off.

543
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
During the next board meeting

544
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,040
I'll vote in favor of you.

545
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,120
Mr. Yang

546
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,880
really gives me no surprise.

547
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
Since Mr. Yang

548
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,720
is being so straightforward,

549
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,280
what about this?

550
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,480
Ask your son

551
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,240
to apologize to me in the newspaper,

552
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,670
and swear not to

553
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,600
do anything inappropriate

554
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,030
to any other lady.

555
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,200
Then, surrender himself to the police.

556
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,520
If you ruin him,

557
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160
you'll ruin your own reputation too.

558
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
I did nothing wrong.

559
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
Why will my reputation be ruined?

560
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,200
Moreover,

561
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,270
he did something wrong,

562
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,600
so he has to bear the consequences.

563
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,360
Why? He is afraid to admit what he has done?

564
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,350
You're too young.

565
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,480
You don't understand

566
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,800
what this impact does to a girl.

567
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,400
Uncle Yang wants to

568
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,120
keep things low,

569
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,150
because I'm being considerate to you.

570
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,480
Where's your father?

571
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,390
I've known him for so long.

572
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,720
I'll talk to him.

573
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,040
Hi, Chairman Lu.

574
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,440
About Yang Ming...

575
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,790
We'll sue him. We have to.

576
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,400
Send him to prison.

577
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,670
Mr. Yang,

578
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,600
why are you here?

579
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,320
Lu,

580
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,440
it was just an accident.

581
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,280
A rare incident.

582
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,320
Can you save me some face

583
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,080
on this matter?

584
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,240
Forget it for just once.

585
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,200
I promise

586
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,240
I'll teach my son

587
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,720
a proper lesson.

588
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,240
You want to teach him a lesson?

589
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
I think that's not necessary.

590
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
Someone else will teach him a lesson.

591
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,960
Don't you know

592
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,830
what's wrong with Yang Ming?

593
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
He repeatedly harasses ladies.

594
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,880
He is not the first offender.

595
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
This time,

596
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
he even laid his hands on Fangning.

597
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,350
Is he tired of living?

598
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,800
He doesn't want to live anymore, right?

599
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240
If you think Fangning is being merciless,

600
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,920
why haven't you broken his legs?

601
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,440
-Lu, you...
-I'm telling you.

602
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,440
This time,

603
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,640
you'll pay for the litigation fees
and attorney fees.

604
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,120
How dare he get upset?

605
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,040
Let me tell you.

606
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,870
He set a bad example for his son.

607
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,960
That's right.

608
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,439
I have a very good example to look up to.

609
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,070
Regarding this,

610
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,310
you have to

611
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,040
reflect too.

612
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,240
You are also responsible for this too.

613
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,520
I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

614
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,040
By the way, Chairman Lu.

615
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,160
Let me give you a heads up.

616
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,310
I'm getting married.

617
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:31,990
Do it.

618
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,680
Who is getting married?

619
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,790
Me.

620
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,160
You?

621
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,830
Me.

622
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,960
Getting married.

623
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Why are you getting married?

624
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,680
Who told you to get married?

625
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,870
-You wanted me to get married.
-I...

626
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
No, but...

627
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,520
Okay. I won't ask much.

628
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,350
Just this one question.

629
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,680
Who's the guy?

630
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,350
What's his name? What does he do?

631
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,160
How's his academic background?

632
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Where does he work?

633
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,560
Don't worry.

634
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,320
-He is very handsome.
-But, his parents...

635
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
What do his parents do?

636
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,400
He's tall.

637
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,320
-His family background.
-Most importantly,

638
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,600
he is a vigorous man.

639
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,240
Vigorous.

640
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,080
Why don't you

641
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,480
marry a weightlifter?

642
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,440
Vigorous.

643
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Are you sure?

644
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,520
Then,

645
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,640
invite him and his parents

646
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,000
to our place.

647
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,440
It's a marriage.

648
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,200
I have to

649
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,840
talk to his parents.

650
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,600
How about that?

651
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,920
As soon as possible.

652
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,000
As soon as possible.

653
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,280
The patient at Bed 36,

654
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,640
although the focus of infection
has been removed,

655
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,440
we still need to follow up
with his treatment.

656
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,720
Then, I'll make a plan
with the internal medicine,

657
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
and show it to you later.

658
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,360
Dr. Ling.

659
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,080
We didn't meet last time,

660
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,160
she comes here directly.

661
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,240
I have two tickets

662
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,680
to a standup comedy.

663
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,840
You mentioned you like it.

664
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,310
I wonder

665
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,520
if you're free tonight.

666
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,240
I'm sorry.

667
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
I have other arrangements in the evening.

668
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,560
It's okay.

669
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
I like it too.

670
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,720
I'll go with you.

671
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,720
Back then,

672
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,240
you made up excuses before you rejected them.

673
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
You're quite straightforward now,

674
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,000
right?

675
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,640
Things are different.

676
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,920
Li,

677
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
can you bring me the medical record

678
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,550
of the patient at Bed 36?

679
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,560
Okay.

680
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,470
-Thanks.
-What is it different?

681
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,560
Did the cool guy just get cooler?

682
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,480
What are you looking at?

683
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Who's the patient that needs
so many screenings?

684
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,480
Premarital screening.

685
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm getting married.

686
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,310
Thanks, Li.

687
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,960
He has someone.

688
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,280
A boss? Ling Rui.

689
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,040
Is it the boss?

690
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,680
[Emergency]

691
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,600
You bought a new car.

692
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,120
Didn't you say that

693
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,240
the previous car was too conspicuous?

694
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,800
Let's go. I'll send you home today.

695
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,400
Let's go.

696
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,630
[Andrology]

697
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,200
Off you go.

698
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,880
Why is this on the checklist?

699
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,240
This is a must in a premarital screening.

700
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,360
There are many items on the checklist

701
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,680
which are not necessary
for a premarital screening.

702
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,000
This is only

703
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,110
for our future happiness.

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,590
I am so busy with my job.

705
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,880
I don't have time to go through this.

706
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,030
Moreover,

707
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,280
you should be considerate of me.

708
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,000
I have OCD.

709
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
A severe relationship OCD.

710
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
Therefore, I need to make sure

711
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,920
the man who's going to

712
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,160
spend days and nights with me

713
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,750
is healthy and clean.

714
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,120
It's for the sake of both of us.

715
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,280
Besides, you're a doctor.

716
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,790
Why is a doctor afraid of a screening?

717
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm not going to watch.

718
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Did you stay up for the past two nights?

719
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,440
Let me tell you.

720
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,350
It's better not to stay up

721
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,840
three to five days before the screening.

722
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,200
It'll affect the results.

723
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,120
Madam.

724
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,920
My husband is in there.

725
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,840
Don't worry.

726
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,920
This screening is not that difficult

727
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,800
for the men.

728
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,230
You look quite professional.

729
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
I've seen a lot of people like them.

730
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,040
You are worried about your husband's

731
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,000
physical ability, right?

732
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,110
Does he usually stay up late?

733
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,040
Does he smoke and drink?

734
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
All of this will affect him.

735
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,280
What's the better way to do it?

736
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,280
Maintain good habits.

737
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,960
Exercise more.

738
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,720
Eat more food

00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,040
containing vitamins.

Vitamins

741
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,280
are very important for men.

742
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,710
Thanks. Anything else?

Your husband looks healthy.

Don't worry, he will be fine.

746
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,760
Thanks.

747
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,600
If you are too busy,

748
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,470
you don't have to stay with me.

749
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,200
No. I'm not that busy.

750
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,560
That...

751
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,150
You're done?

752
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
Really?

753
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,800
So quick?

754
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Are you sure you're done with the screening?

755
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,840
I'm also a doctor.

If you have any question

757
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,800
in the future,

758
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,960
you can ask me.

759
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,560
Is there anything I need to pay attention to

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,920
during tomorrow's meeting?

761
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,310
Nothing much.

762
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,920
Our marriage has nothing to do with them.

763
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,240
Is he nervous?

764
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,360
I assume

765
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,560
there will be three people there tomorrow.

766
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,550
You don't have to know anything
about Lu Wenbin.

767
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,590
Even if you know him well,

768
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,600
it won't help with the situation.

769
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,600
Whatever he says

770
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,680
will not sound good.

771
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,630
Yang Yi.

772
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,110
Lu Wenbin's wife.

773
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,480
The only thing on her mind

774
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,200
is how to get the inheritance from me.

775
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,400
It's been so many years.

776
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,800
She

777
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
still has not succeeded.

778
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,550
Lu Fangyu.

779
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,560
Yang Yi's son.

780
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
He fears me terribly.

781
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
I guess he'll only be eating tomorrow.

782
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,560
That's all.

783
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
My little aunt

784
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,320
has not told anyone

785
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,840
that you are our creditor.

786
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,590
Then, your brother...

787
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,920
He dares not.

788
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,600
Don't worry. I'm here.

789
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,960
Drive safe.
