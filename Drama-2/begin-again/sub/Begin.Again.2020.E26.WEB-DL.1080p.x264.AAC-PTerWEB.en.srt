[Begin Again]

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,150
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,760
Today is the weekend.

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
I guess a visiting professor

6
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,770
won't come either.

7
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,170
I think it's very simple

8
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,720
after you've explained.

9
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,320
You can apply this...

10
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,050
Thank you, teacher.

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,570
Apply this here.

12
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,209
Correct.

13
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,120
This step.

14
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,040
Ling...

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,570
This step is like this.

16
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,720
This question can even be solved like this?

17
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,050
Then a question like this

18
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,920
can be solved using this method

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
in the future, right?

20
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,450
Thank you, teacher.

21
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,770
[He really hates me, right?]

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,250
[I understand.]

23
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,880
[Although...]

24
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,210
[But...]

25
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,470
Miss Lu,

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
the school hopes that

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
this color

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
can match its logo.

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,120
I was wondering if you can change it?

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,800
[He's such a good man,]

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
[but you yourself abandoned him.]

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,279
[What do you want now?]

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,520
[Lu Fangning.]

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,930
Bastard.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,720
Bas...

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,840
It can be remained also.

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
I understand.

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,040
Artists usually have their own

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,640
insistence on what should be done,

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,410
right?

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,320
[Haven't you already told yourself that if he ignores you,]

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,530
[you'll do the same, too?]

43
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,120
[Why did you want to call him?]

44
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Fool.

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,120
So stupid.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,450
Stupid?

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,730
Miss Lu,

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,650
did I do something wrong?

49
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,010
Miss Lu.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,570
What did I do wrong?

51
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,610
You can just point it out.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,450
I'll correct it

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,640
whether there's a mistake or not.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,160
Well...

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm sorry, everyone.

56
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,760
I was thinking of another case

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
in my mind just now.

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
Show me the suggestions from the school for the amendments.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,310
Thank you.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,560
Who did you refer to

61
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,880
when you said "bastard" and "fool" just now?

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,920
I meant

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,480
no matter how despicable the customers are,

64
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,279
we have to treat them

65
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,490
as fools.

66
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,040
To be meticulous and patient.

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,320
This is the valuable experience

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,360
I've gained from my work for so many years.

69
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,000
I see.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,700
-It's a wise opinion.
-Well said!

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,710
-It's a wise opinion.
-Let's jot it down quickly.

72
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,380
-Jot it down.
-Okay.

73
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,280
You're welcome.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,720
As a senior, that's what I should do.

75
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,560
Okay.

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,920
I'll handle this.

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,570
Then that's it for today.

78
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,410
Thank you, everyone.

79
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,760
Okay.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,320
By the way,

81
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,849
I would like to know

82
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,590
how to get to the school's Faculty of Medicine.

83
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,320
Faculty of Medicine?

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,640
The Faculty of Medicine is on the west campus.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,230
It takes almost 15 minutes

86
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,280
to walk there.

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,330
Okay, thank you.

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
Thank you for your hard work today, everyone.

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,160
-You too.
-Bye-bye!

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,990
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

91
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,660
-Miss Lu, be careful.
-Bye-bye!

92
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,370
Bye-bye!

93
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,560
That was a really good opinion.

94
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,440
Jot it down.

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Let's check

96
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,650
to see if we miss out on anything.

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,560
We can include additional points.

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
[West campus?]

99
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,690
Show me what you jotted down.

100
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
[Then I'll go east then.]

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,810
Those just now

102
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,160
It'll be very helpful to us in the future.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Little grandpa,

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
what are you looking at?

105
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,960
Is there anything opposite?

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,090
How long do

107
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,200
we need to look at this?

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
I was not looking at anything.

109
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,050
I was in a daze.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,170
For a whole day like this?

111
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,359
How do you use the rope?

112
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,200
Can I jump rope?

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
One.

114
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,290
Two.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Three.

116
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,920
Four.

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,650
This is over?

118
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,960
Little grandpa.

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,480
Little grandpa.

120
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Mom, I'm so bored.

121
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,400
Come and save me.

122
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,520
[I got the direction wrong?]

123
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,400
[How come we're still bumping into each other?]

124
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,600
Come, coffee for you.

125
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,760
Thank you.

126
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,080
[He's smiling like that to others again.]

127
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,200
[He doesn't know]

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,570
[how charming his smile is.]

129
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,480
May I be excused?

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay.

131
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,490
Fangning.

132
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,650
Long time no see.

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,080
[What's going on?]

134
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,160
[It's the second edition of the act?]

135
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Long time no see.

136
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,840
You seem to be in a haggard state.

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Do you want coffee?

138
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you.

139
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,650
Drink less coffee.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,840
Your stomach is always in a bad condition.

141
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
[What does he mean?]

142
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,090
[Why did he care]

143
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,130
[about my stomach all of a sudden?]

144
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,010
Goodbye.

145
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,760
Good...

146
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,400
Bye.

147
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Teacher, let's go.

148
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
Okay.

149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,970
He ignored me in the first place,

150
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
but cared about my stomach afterward.

151
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,520
What exactly does he want to do?

152
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:49,989
[He's here again.]

153
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,840
[Just let him be. I'm not afraid of him.]

154
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,770
Ling Rui.

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,040
Well...

156
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Is there anything

157
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
that you didn't tell me?

158
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
[Why did he ask that?]

159
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
[Did he discover something?]

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,520
[He's aware of Youyou's existence?]

161
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,520
You took the wrong file.

162
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,320
The wrong file was taken,

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
but the staff in the school's office is off work now,

165
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,040
so things can't be done anyway.

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,170
Shall we

167
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,050
eat together then?

168
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,480
Okay.

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,690
I said,

170
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,920
let's eat together.

171
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,960
Sit down.

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,560
Little grandpa, I'm still a kid.

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,890
I'll be ruined

174
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,770
sitting like this all day.

175
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
You can talk to me

176
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,600
even if you don't want to play with me.

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
What do you want to talk about?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,960
Such as...

179
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,080
It's time for lunch.

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
I want to eat fried chicken and pizza.

181
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,200
Your mom

182
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,410
told me not to let you eat fried chicken and pizza.

183
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,440
But it's okay to eat instant noodles.

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,560
I won't eat it.

185
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
I won't eat it.

186
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,160
I won't eat it.

187
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,680
I won't eat it.

188
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,970
Mom said

189
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,690
that little grandpa treated her very well before.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,610
Why do you treat me like this?

191
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,570
Because your mom is a girl,

192
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
but you're a boy.

193
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,560
Of course it's different.

194
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,050
Little grandpa, this is discrimination.

195
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,490
I'll tell my mom.

196
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
You didn't want to answer the phone?

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,170
It must be an advertisement

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,560
or something useless.

199
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,330
There was no need to pick up.

200
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,360
[What to do now?]

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
[I must reject him at once.]

202
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,880
[Why eating together?]

203
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,040
[What if Youyou calls again?]

204
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,800
[What should I do?]

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Lu Fangning.

206
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,760
Yes.

207
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,560
When did you come back?

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
The day before yesterday.

209
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
Did you return to China for an exhibition?

210
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
I established

211
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,360
my own home furnishing brand

212
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,840
overseas.

213
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
White Queen?

214
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,840
White Queen.

215
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,640
White Queen.

216
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,480
Congratulations.

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,410
You've fulfilled your wish now.

218
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,360
You came back alone?

219
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,800
[What does he mean]

220
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,930
[asking if I was alone?]

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,610
Of course.

222
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,280
It was because of work.

223
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,760
I didn't bring my team with me for the work.

224
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,050
I came back alone.

225
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,370
Ling Rui.

226
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
I know

228
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
that I was in the wrong

229
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,720
before.

230
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,550
I left without saying anything that year.

231
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,320
It was my wishful thinking for us to get married

232
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,320
and get divorced.

233
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,320
I came back this time

234
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,040
not to

235
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,840
disturb your life. I mean it.

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,360
I...

237
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,840
I also saw

238
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,520
that you're doing well now.

239
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,800
That's great.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,040
That's enough.

241
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
In short,

242
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,400
six years have passed.

243
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,600
I won't be thick-skinned,

244
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,640
asking you

245
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
to forgive me

246
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
and let go of the grudges.

247
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,160
But rest assured

248
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,000
that once I'm done here,

249
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
I'll leave right away. I mean it.

250
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,630
I'll disappear

251
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,490
in front of you forever.

252
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,880
I won't appear

253
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,160
in front of you anymore.

254
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
I got it.

255
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,350
Got it?

256
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
I said, I got it.

257
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
What do you mean now?

258
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,160
I know it all.

259
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,880
And then?

260
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,770
[Shouldn't he express his thoughts,]

261
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,080
[saying that it doesn't matter and I don't have to be like this,]

262
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,530
[or he can't forgive me?]

263
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,880
It's better not to drink the coffee.

264
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
It's bad for the stomach.

265
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Don't mind what happened just now.

266
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,480
There was really no other way.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,670
That was to avoid unnecessary trouble.

268
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Also, don't get me wrong

269
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,250
that I have other intentions.

270
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,910
Of course. I...

271
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,750
How could I?

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Professor Ling, I'm sorry.

273
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,120
You go ahead.

274
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you all right?

275
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm fine.

276
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,400
What did you

277
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
say just now?

278
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,600
I just wanted to say

279
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,360
that you seemed to take the file first.

280
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,360
So?

281
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,160
So...

282
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,120
So I'm leaving first.

283
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
Thank you.

284
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,970
Just now...

285
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,080
Another day.

286
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,330
Let's talk about having a meal together another day.

[A mini drama] [What matters in life is the flutter of heart]

288
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
It's all garbage.

00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,730
[First Chapter, I Don't Want to See You Again]

290
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,640
Hello, editor.

291
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,200
Why are you calling me

292
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
at this time?

293
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,770
I'm at the critical moment

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,150
of creation.

295
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,240
Do you know?

296
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,040
I've thought about a fabulous beginning

297
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,960
for the second half.

298
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
As long as the beginning is successful,

299
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,850
everything will go well after that.

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,640
I got it.

301
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
Thinking of a beginning

302
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,450
means

303
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,530
that you haven't even begun writing a single word.

304
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,480
I got it clear.

305
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,240
I actually called

306
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,970
for another thing.

307
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,680
I want to ask you

308
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,950
For the novel making your name,

309
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,360
which is the one that you're together with your boss,

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,160
it isn't a plagiarized one, right?

311
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,920
What?

312
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,530
Plagiarism?

313
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,520
Which jerk

314
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,120
slandered me?

315
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,720
So do you have any evidence?

316
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,600
Evidence?

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,880
Evidence.

318
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
The evidence is...

319
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,170
This is my personal experience.

320
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,480
Are you sure?

321
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,360
Yes.

322
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,720
Little grandpa, I'm done.

323
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,279
I'm done.

324
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,559
I'm done.

325
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,670
Little grandpa, I'm done.

326
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,430
I'm done, little grandpa.

327
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,760
There're animated films here.

328
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,080
Go and watch for half an hour.

329
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,570
I don't want to watch animated films.

330
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,520
I don't want to play games either.

331
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,320
I want to watch the news.

332
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,770
Social media can also do.

333
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,770
You also used Weibo when you were abroad?

334
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,560
Mom only allowed me to use this

335
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,320
to learn Chinese.

336
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,090
There was no need to plagiarize?

337
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
Little grandpa,

338
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
what does "plagiarism" mean?

339
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me have a look.

340
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,050
Let me have a look.

341
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Little grandpa, I saw it first.

342
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
What are you doing?

343
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,100
[Cai Siyu's Weibo]

344
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,950
There was no need to plagiarize the story

345
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,760
that I'm together with my boss.

346
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,170
I confessed to him on the spur of the moment,

347
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,650
and I succeeded.

348
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,360
Little grandpa.

349
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,680
Little grandpa.

350
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,560
Little grandpa.

351
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,320
Why did you hang up on me?

352
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
Why did you pick me up

353
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,400
an hour late?

354
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
Baby, change your shoes.

355
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,000
Come.

356
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,760
Give me slippers.

357
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,360
Didn't you say that you've already

358
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,310
grown up

359
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,480
and are not clingy anymore?

360
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,360
What happened?

361
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,280
Mom,

362
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
you didn't know how boring

363
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,840
little grandpa's house was.

364
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,240
He didn't even watch TV.

365
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,360
He didn't go out, too.

366
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,000
Except eating and being in a daze,

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,840
he just checked out Weibo

368
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
awhile.

369
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,840
By the way, he also had a workout.

370
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,200
But he only pulled the rope three times.

371
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,560
I don't know if it works.

372
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,480
How did he pull it?

373
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,250
Like this.

374
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,790
You're so good. Weren't you happy?

375
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,400
By the way, Mom.

376
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
What does "plagiarism" mean?

377
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,040
It means

378
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
that a person

379
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,800
produces another person's article

380
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,610
by writing in his own words

381
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,920
again.

382
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,040
Then what about "coupling"?

383
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,090
What does "couple" mean?

384
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,450
Oops, this...

385
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
This...

386
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,360
Is it copying?

387
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,200
But why must copying the documents

388
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,010
be done with the boss?

389
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,000
It's not the case.

390
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,930
It doesn't mean so.

391
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,720
Let me tell you.

392
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,320
How am I going to put it into words?

393
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,670
It's just like fries and tomato sauce.

394
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,010
They're compatible.

395
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,760
So

396
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,960
they're paired together.

397
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
They're a match made in heaven.

398
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,550
Do you understand?

399
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,090
It's like some people like ice cream very much,

400
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,800
and they eat it with fries.

401
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,480
So fries and ice cream

402
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
are also a perfect match.

403
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,680
Correct.

404
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,520
Simply pairing is wrong.

405
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,130
Of course.

406
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,370
So we can't learn,

407
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,120
okay?

408
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,280
Mom,

409
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
have you done something like this?

410
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,840
Didn't mom tell you

411
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,520
the first thing to do when you're back home?

412
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,560
-To wash hands.
-To wash hands.

413
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,680
Right, go now.

414
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
Okay, go and wash your hands.

415
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,690
Go now.

416
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,960
What else am I thinking?

417
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,840
How dare I have any other thoughts?

418
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,520
Lu Fangning.

419
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,360
You can't think about it anymore.

420
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,880
Be conscious.

421
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,640
Why was I so unlucky?

422
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,480
How come

423
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
I always bumped into him?

424
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
Mom, you...

425
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,280
There's something fishy with you.

426
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,770
What's wrong with me?

427
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,480
You're blushing.

428
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,370
You even "fried eggs" on the sofa.

429
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,440
Lu Youyou, let me ask you.

430
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,360
Why did you come back?

431
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,840
I came to look for dad.

432
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,080
What about me?

433
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,570
You were to bring me back here and to work.

434
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,000
Correct.

435
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,720
Right.

436
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,080
There're too many temptations in this world.

437
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,320
I can't be attracted by

438
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,280
his handsome look.

439
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,320
Youyou,

440
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,640
we'll go back soon.

441
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,800
Why? There're danger and trap?

442
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
It's way too dangerous.

443
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,870
[Please let us know your choice]

444
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,860
[Person in charge, Shen Zhuo]

445
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400
Shen Zhuo?

446
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,840
I'm done.

447
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,280
Mom.

448
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,680
-You're awake?
-What are you doing?

449
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
Mom is packing things.

450
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,880
Go to brush your teeth and wash your face now.

451
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800
We'll be leaving

452
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,760
once we've finished breakfast later.

453
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,440
Where are we going?

454
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
We're going back.

455
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,640
Why are we going back?

456
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,070
What about your job?

457
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,880
Your mom is very smart.

458
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,850
I stayed up all night

459
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,760
and finished

460
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,440
all the work.

461
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,210
Come, give me a kiss as my reward.

462
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,110
I don't want to go back.

463
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,520
Youyou!

464
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
Lu Youyou, look at me.

465
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,880
Is your last name Lu?

466
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Are you still my son?

467
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,840
Let me tell you.

468
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,120
You can't act shamelessly.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,720
No matter how big is the scene you make this time around,

470
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,890
I'll definitely leave.

471
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,970
If you don't want to leave,

472
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,720
I'll leave you

473
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,410
alone here.

474
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,890
You go and live with your little grandpa.

475
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,050
Don't pout.

476
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,690
Darling, I'm here.

477
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,250
Open the door.

478
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,040
Why did you close the door?

479
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,400
Open the door. I was wrong.

480
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,240
Why did you close the door?

481
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,920
Lu Fangning.

482
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,490
Lu Fangning.

483
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,920
I was wrong.

484
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,320
I'm such a bastard.

485
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,760
How dare I manipulated Lu Youyou to deceive you?

486
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,830
He's just a kid.

487
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,090
He's only five years old.

488
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,200
I couldn't believe that I actually brought him on my own

489
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
and took a plane for over ten hours.

490
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,480
If something happens,

491
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
will I be held responsible for it?

492
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,070
How am I going to be held responsible for it?

493
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,910
Shen Zhuo, I warn you.

494
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't act here.

495
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,570
Don't prank me

496
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,480
with my son.

497
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
I admit it.

498
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,240
At that time, I really...

499
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,130
Who let you sit?

500
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,320
There was "water" in my brain. [*One is out of his senses]

501
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,200
No.

502
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,680
It was "soy sauce".

503
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,480
I had no choice since my hands are in such a state now.

504
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,010
If you didn't come back and appear,

505
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,550
then I'd have to go home

506
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,920
and inherit the soy sauce business.

507
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,960
Isn't it good to inherit the business?

508
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,210
I feel that your vibe

509
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,280
suits it well.

510
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,880
Shen Zhuo, do you think

511
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,080
that since we've known each other for more than ten years,

512
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,310
and are now doing business together,

513
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,200
you can simply test

514
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
my limits?

515
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,210
I don't dare to.

516
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,690
I'll never dare to.

517
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,760
The preparation for the exhibition

518
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,800
has been done.

519
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,330
Are you here

520
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,880
to pick us up today?

521
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,840
There's a great opportunity.

522
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,480
What is the opportunity?

523
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,210
I mean

524
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,560
there's a

525
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,600
great opportunity

526
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,880
right in front of us.

527
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,680
An art park contacted me,

528
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,690
hoping that our brand

529
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,830
can enter their park.

530
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,720
The terms they offered are

531
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,530
unbelievably incredible.

532
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,080
We definitely have the upper hand.

533
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,030
I even went to see the park

534
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,160
a few days ago.

535
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,890
Their vibe

536
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,800
matches ours really well.

537
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,320
We're compatible.

538
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Let me tell you.

539
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,520
This is a perfect opportunity

540
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,440
for us

541
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,600
to enter the domestic market.

542
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,800
If you didn't grab this opportunity,

543
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,570
you were not

544
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
Lu Fangning.

545
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
After opening the shop, you'll be assigned a greater percentage of profit.

546
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,560
I used to be allocated more than you.

547
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,960
How about 90 percent of the profit goes to you?

548
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,870
This is a new chapter

549
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,120
in my design career.

550
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,880
It's a perfect opportunity for Youyou

551
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,160
to become the third generation of an affluent family again.

552
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,970
How is it, Ms. Lu?

553
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,760
To accept or not to accept?

554
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,920
Okay, I'll accept.

555
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,630
Where is my son?

556
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,470
Why is he not here

557
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,240
to welcome his dad?

558
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,530
Nonsense. It's the godfather.

559
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,310
Sit here and don't move.

560
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,960
Lu Youyou.

561
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,880
Youyou.

562
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,040
Youyou.

563
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
Youyou.

564
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,320
You're still mad at me?

565
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,170
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I heard

567
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,840
that if people keep sleeping on their stomachs,

568
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,920
their faces will be flattened,

569
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,160
and they won't look good.

570
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,920
Okay, as you wish now.

571
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,840
We can't leave now.

572
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
Uncle Shen is here as well.

573
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,320
Really? You didn't lie to me?

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,360
That's true.

575
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,680
Don't feign ignorance here.

576
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Uncle Shen was presenting a big show

577
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,600
outside just now.

578
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,240
Don't tell me that you didn't hear it.

579
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,440
What's wrong again, naughty little boy?

580
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,440
You said just now

581
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,160
that you wanted to leave me alone here.

582
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,050
It hurt my

583
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,360
young soul deeply.

584
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,970
You're not allowed to say anymore

585
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,790
that you're going to abandon me.

586
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,990
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

587
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,280
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,040
You women are irrational.

589
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,240
You're not allowed to hug me.

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,650
Please apologize to me.

591
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,710
I'm sorry.

592
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,280
For what?

593
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu Youyou.

594
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,960
I'll never say

595
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
that I'm leaving you alone again.

596
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,040
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

597
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,600
Okay, I forgive you.

598
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,880
You can go

599
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,090
to heat up the milk for me now.

600
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,880
Thank you for being magnanimous.

601
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,450
You're big-hearted.

602
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,680
But before that,

603
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
you still have to grant me

604
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,160
a little wish.

605
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,810
What is it?

606
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,200
From today onward,

607

otherwise

609
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,640
you'll have to stay at home obediently.

610
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
Don't simply run around. Got it?

611
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,320
Why?

612
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,640
If you don't want to,

613
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,440
from now on, you'll call Shen Zhuo your dad then.

614
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Mom, I'm willing to.

615
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,690
Really?

616
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,200
I'm willing to.

[Cai Siyu's Weibo]

618
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,560
There was no need to plagiarize the story

619
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
that I'm together with my boss.

620
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,760
I confessed to him on the spur of the moment,

621
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,400
and I succeeded.

Where are we going?

623
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,080
Go to bed.

624
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,400
Go to bed?

625
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,650
Where to sleep?

626
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,370
Go over there.

627

Last night,

628
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,760
we...

629
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,520
We...

630
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,590
We got drunk?

631
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,970
Don't play this trick with me.

632
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,080
When will the contract be signed?

633
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
What is it?

634
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,440
You're feigning ignorance?

635
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,800
You promised to give me

636
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,890
90 percent of the profit

637
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,600
for five years.

638
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,120
Are you still afraid of me tricking you?

639
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,960
Seriously.

640
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,490
Yes.

641
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,200
You made it happen.

642
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,760
It makes sense

643
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,880
for you to be allocated more.

644
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,040
Why did you say that I made it happen?

645
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,920
I didn't do anything.

646
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,720
We've become famous all over the world.

648
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,800
That's not possible.

649
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
I guess this awesome deal

650
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,010
fell into our laps.

651
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,120
I mean it.

654
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,480
this is my partner,

655
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,200
Lu Fangning.

656
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

657
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,880
Miss Lu and Mr. Shen,

658
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,080
I like your products

659
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,480
very much.

660
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,290
I'm also looking forward to this partnership.

661
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,280
I sincerely hope to see your brand

662
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,440
entering our park.

663
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,120
Thank you for your trust.

664
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,520
I hope that we can have an excellent partnership.

665
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
There's no offense.

666
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm just curious.

667
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,520
Two of you

668
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,440
look compatible together

669
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,480
and are managing a home furnishing brand,

670
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,360
so I was wondering if two of you

671
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,480
are husband and wife?

672
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,000
That's absolutely impossible.

673
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,600
How could I possibly...

674
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,040
I'm sorry.

675
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,400
The question I asked is too personal.

676
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,760
Let's stop here today.

677
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,560
We'll talk about

678
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,840
the details later

679
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,240
after both of you have made a decision.

680
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,320
Be careful.

681
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,280
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

682
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,920
I think there's something fishy.

683
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
He talked to us for a while

684
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,800
and confirmed the partnership.

685
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,080
He even said that he's known us for so long.

686
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
This is so strange.

687
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,840
What did you just say?

688
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,210
Why being together with me...

689
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,520

691
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,000
Why is he here?

692
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,920
Don't tell me that person

693
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
is Youyou's

694
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,920
father?

695
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,370
You spoke too loud.

696
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,520
He doesn't know about it.

697
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,920
He's coming.

698
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,880

705
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,360
you haven't met Shen Zhuo, right?

706
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680

708
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,640

710
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,800
By the way.

711
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,560
Well...

712
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
Why did you happen to be here

713
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,560
and also know

714
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040

715
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,920
It was not a coincidence.

Later on,

718
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,480
we became friends.

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,120

720
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,040

722
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
to collaborate with his park.

723
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,610
I thought of your studio

724
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,090
and mentioned it to him.

725
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,070

What can you do?

731
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,240

By the way, he needs to remove the plaster of the Paris cast today.

734
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,640
I have to go with him,

735
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,080
as his relative.

736
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,670

then please take care of Shen Zhuo.

I'll make a move first.

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,760
What should I do?

761
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,400
This family member.

762
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
If you grasp his arm again,

763
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,240
I might have to give him

764
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,920
-a new cast.
-Sorry.

765
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,650
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,320
I'll wait for you?

767
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,960
I'll wait for you?

768
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,520
This family member.

769
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,200
I think

770
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,680
that you better don't flatter yourself.

771
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,130
What do you mean?

772
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,720
The person you just talked about

773
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,560
is Director Ling, right?

774
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,640
Don't worry.

775
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,120
Director Ling

776
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
won't be interested

777
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,480
in you.

778
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,840
Why can you be certain

779
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,320
that Director Ling

780
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,050
won't be interested in me?

781
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,830
I've been in this hospital for four years.

782
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,840
I've seen countless people like you.

783
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,770
All were defeated.

784
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,040
Do you know why?

785
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,640
Why?

786
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,160
Director Ling is sick.

787
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,680
He was hurt badly

788
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,810
by his ex-wife before.

789
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,600
You're talking about divorce, right?

790
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
It was a divorce, right?

791
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,960
A divorce.

792
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,880
Getting divorced is normal now.

793
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,560
It's not a big deal.

794
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,960
The abnormal one is his ex-wife.

795
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,400
I just don't understand

796
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,280
why such a good person like Director Ling

797
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,960
would be into her in the first place.

798
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,080
I also heard

799
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,880
that not only does this woman look mediocre,

800
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,160
but also she's vicious.

801
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,520
When they first got married,

802
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,850
she already started torturing Director Ling.

803
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Not letting him go home.

804
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,130
After that,

805
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,720
not only did she hinder him from work,

806
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
but she also forced him to switch careers.

807
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,600
In the end,

808
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,880
guess what?

809
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
His ex-wife ran away.

810
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,560
She ran away with another guy.

811
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,160
Is it that this woman

812
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,320
is heartless?

813
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,030
Garbage.

814
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,280
She caused the medical field

815
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,080
to nearly lose

816
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,480
such an excellent doctor.

817
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,240
Doctor.

818
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,760
The version that I heard

819
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,200
seems not to be like this.

820
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,880
I heard

821
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,490
that Dr. Ling's ex-wife

822
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,880
is beautiful,

823
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,960
has milky skin,

824
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,050
and is kind-hearted.

825
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,160
Like a gold.

826
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
No, like a diamond.

827
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,840
Not only is she from a noble background,

828
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,120
but also she

829
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,480
has a generous heart to take care of

830
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,200
the underprivileged.

831
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,050
Do you know how precious this is?

832
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,690
I heard

833
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,800
that she donated a lot of money

834
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
to the sick children in this hospital.

835
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
Have you heard of it?

836
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,760
There seemed to be such a thing.

837
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,040
So

838
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,790
gossip is like this.

839
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,680
There's no real version

840
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,920
with people spreading it around.

841
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,240
-Like me...
-Director Ling.

842
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,770
Is it done?

843
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,120
It's almost done.

844
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,400
I have a stomach ache.

845
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,010
I have a stomach ache.

846
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
-You have a stomach ache?
-Yes.

847
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,160
Stomach ache might be serious.

848
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,320
I have to check for you properly.

849
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:19,960
Let's go.

850
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm leaving.

851
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,960
Well...

852
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,600
Your stomach hurts?

853
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,520
Where does it hurt?

854
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Is it here?

855
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Or it's here?

856
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,330
I... My stomach doesn't hurt.

857
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,650
You look so uncomfortable.

858
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,970
Are you sure you don't need to have a detailed check-up?

859
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,080
-No.
-Is it here?

860
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,920
I got it wrong just now.

861
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,080
I have gastric pain.

862
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,240
There's a little discomfort with my gastric.

863
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,130
Sit down.

864
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,920
You always

865
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,190
have gastric pain.

866
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,800
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

867
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,690
You still remember?

868
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,360
Of course I remember.

869
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
After all, you're my ex-wife with

870
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
milky skin and a diamond heart.

871
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,730
By the way.

872
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,920
I heard from Mr. Cao

873
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,560
that you and Mr. Shen

874
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,560
only have an ordinary partnership relationship.

875
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,840
The medicine is ready.

876
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,810
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital, Prescription Slip]

877
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,520
Thank you.

878
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,760
Fangning.

879
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,800
My number

880
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,790
hasn't changed.
