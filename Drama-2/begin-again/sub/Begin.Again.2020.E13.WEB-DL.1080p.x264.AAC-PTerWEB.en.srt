[Begin Again]

00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,679
The proposal that you just gave me

5
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,800
is not like what you said.

6
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,480
Have a look at it.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Sure, I'll check it.

8
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,679
I'll hand it to you in a while.

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Yes, please do.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:04,480
These flowers...

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,570
Director Lu threw

13
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,200
these flowers away last time.

14
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
I bumped into you accidentally last time.

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,160
It's okay.

17
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,080
Director, we have good news.

18
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,050
We found a new factory to replace Jiang Cheng.

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,240
The equipment specifications
of the production line,

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
quality data,

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
price, and location are all suitable.

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,000
Who negotiated with this factory?

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,610
Manager Wang from the Production Department.

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Is there a problem?

25
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:37,970
Let's talk about it in my office.

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
He's so cute.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,960
My heart.

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,840
She's fangirling.

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
I like the feeling of

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,320
eating with my family.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm willing to cook for them.

32
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,600
This is the President

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
of Shanghai Cuisine Professional Association,

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Expert of Jiangnan Food Culture

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
Communication Center,

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,040
Honorary President of the
Yangtze River Delta Famous Chefs Association,

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
Chairman of the
World Chinese Cuisine Association,

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,520
also known as the Culinary King of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cuisine, Chef Guo.

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Ms. Lu, may I ask

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
what kind of dishes
would you like to learn today?

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,279
As long as you can say it,

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,440
there is nothing I can't cook.

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Stir-fried vegetables.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
Isn't this a little too perfect?

45
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,480
♫ Makes me believe in destiny ♫

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,240
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,360
One more teaspoon.

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,480
♫ I know the future is too uncertain ♫

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
Smart.

50
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:28,039
Sadfishing

51
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:28,920
is not my style.

52
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,980
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

53
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,840
♫ Listen to this carefully,
this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,320
♫ You must love and give with all your heart ♫

55
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,640
♫ I'll love you well ♫

56
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,000
♫ When I speak of love,
I mean it wholeheartedly ♫

57
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,720
♫ To prove that
you'll always be my one and only ♫

58
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,280
♫ From now on, my heartbeat, pulse, and breath ♫

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,720
You're back.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm back.

61
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Change your shoes here.

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,320
I'll do it by myself.

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,800
It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll help you.

65
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,080
Thank you.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,770
How was everything in the hospital today?

67
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,920
How was your work?

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Were you busy? Tired?

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,080
It was okay.

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
That's good then.

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,680
I'll wash my hands first.

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,120
The vegetables that you like,

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,810
fish,

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Mapo tofu

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,720
and the soup that I made.

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
I cooked all of these myself.

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,359
Did you really...

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400
cook all of these?

79
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,359
Of course,

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,600
I learned from the chef

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
for several hours.

82
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:56,450
The chef also said that

83
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
a smart person

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,040
can indeed do everything well.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,320
He said that I had

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,720
some talent for cooking.

87
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,120
Have a try.

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
If you think they're good,

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
I'll cook for you more often in the future.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,320
Let me get you some soup.

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,400
Thank you.

92
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,360
Try it.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,520
Taste it.

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,440
Is it good?

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,530
Is it too salty?

96
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
You know, it's my first time.

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,240
And...

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
the chef wasn't with me

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
so I don't know

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
how much salt to add.

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,609
But I will try

102
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:46,800
to improve my cooking skills.

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,760
If you have the time,

104
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
you may teach me, too.

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,680
Fangning,

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,320
I said

107
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,570
I don't want you to act like this.

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
What do you mean?

109
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Didn't you say

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
you like the feeling of

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,680
eating with your family?

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
That's why I tried so hard

113
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
to cook so many dishes.

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,360
I want you to feel at home.

115
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,720
You

116
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,400
don't like it?

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,160
Do you like it?

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,920
Lu Fangning,

119
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
although we

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
started this lie together,

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
I really don't like to lie.

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,360
I hate it more

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,000
when you keep telling another lie.

124
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm not lying.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm showing you

126
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,850
my sincerity.

127
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,440
I mean it.

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,280
Because I love…

129
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay.

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
If you don't like it,

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
I won't say it.

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,440
All right?

133
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
But I want you to know that,

134
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Ling Rui,

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
no matter how much you try to avoid,

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
you can't resist

137
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,880
my feelings for you.

138
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Why do you want to run away?

139
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
Are your feelings for me real?

140
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
I saw the takeaway packages for

141
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,240
these dishes

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,960
in the trash can outside.

143
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Don't tell me

144
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
someone else has ordered

145
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,840
the exact same dishes

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,080
as these on the table.

147
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
But how can takeaway food

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,080
taste so salty?

149
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
You're a smart person.

150
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
To pretend that you cooked all of these dishes,

151
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
you deliberately added more salt.

152
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Lu Fangning.

153
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,400
Liking someone,

154
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,800
love,

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,440
sincerity,

156
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,560
are never something

157
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,840
to be said so casually.

158
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,480
The reason you can keep saying it

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,239
as if it means nothing

160
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:49,759
is because...

161
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
For you,

162
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,690
lying is something that can be easily done.

163
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,570
Whether it's the cooking this time

164
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,560
or the charity auction.

165
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,880
You always think that

166
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
money can solve all problems.

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,320
But you never consider

168
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,130
other people's feelings.

169
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,880
You just want to achieve

170
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,960
your own purposes.

171
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,200
This may be your

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,160
way of doing things.

173
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
But please don't do it in

174
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,440
such a way

175
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
to mess with my feelings

176
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
and my life.

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,760
Let us calm down a little.

178
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm not eating.

179
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,440
I don't consider your feelings?

180
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,920
You know what?

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
It is you who

182
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,530
are inconsiderate of others' feelings

183
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,640
and trampled on someone's heart.

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,240
Not me.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,000
Ling Rui,

186
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
do you think

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
I lied about everything I said?

188
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,040
So what am I supposed to do?

189
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Imitate the stories in romance novels

190
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,880
and dramas,

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
get drunk and tell the truth?

192
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,490
As if no matter what the person says,

193
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,520
as long as he is drunk,

194
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,810
people will believe what he said.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Sure.

196
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
You don't believe me, do you?

197
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
I'll show you

198
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
how to get drunk and tell the truth.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,320
Drinking will not solve the problem.

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,160
Lu Fangning,

201
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,720
give it to me.

202
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,800
Give me the wine.

203
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,810
Stop drinking!

204
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,760
Give it to me!

205
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,920
What are you doing?

206
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,920
Don't worry.

207
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,960
I can't get drunk.

208
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,250
Why?

209
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,440
To socialize with my business partners,

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
I drink wine at home every day.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
So, I can't get drunk.

212
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,880
If I can't get drunk

213
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,770
in my life,

214
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,720
are you never going to trust me

215
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,000
in your life?

216
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,640
I, Lu Fangning,

217
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
have never acted like this before.

218
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,880
Back then,

219
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
if I did something good,

220
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,600
I would go on broadcast

221
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
and tell the whole world

222
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
that I did it.

223
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,840
If I cut

224
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
one of my fingers,

225
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
I would bandage

226
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
the rest of my fingers

227
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,880
and show them to you.

228
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
But what about now?

229
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,160
I feel insecure every day.

230
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm cautious.

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,080
All I can think about is

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
if you will be happy

233
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
if you will be pleased.

234
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
What I have done wrong?

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
What I have done wrong?

236
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
You think that

237
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,280
I have disturbed your life.

238
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,800
Haven't you

239
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,450
disturbed mine, too?

240
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,000
Ling Rui,

241
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
if you don't like me,

242
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
you can reject me.

243
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
Just reject me.

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,040
Why do you

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,160
repeatedly

246
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,640
deny my feelings

247
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,000
and my love for you?

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Is it because it makes you look

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
better and superior?

250
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,720
Lu Fangning.

251
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Stop talking. Stop!

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
I hate you!

253
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
Ling Rui,

254
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,840
from now on,

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,240
I hate you.

256
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
Fangning!

257
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Ms. Lu's parcel.

258
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Okay, thank you.

259
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,480
I suggest you check it in my presence.

260
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,520
Okay.

261
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,920
Please open the package then.

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,490
Okay.

263
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,200
Thank you.

264
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
You're welcome.

265
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
I feel insecure every day.

266
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm cautious.

267
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,650
All I can think about is

268
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,960
if you will be happy

269
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,440
if you will be pleased.

270
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
What I have done is wrong?

271
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,960
What I have done is wrong?

272
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,920
If I cut

273
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,040
one of my fingers,

274
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,560
I would bandage

275
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,520
the rest of my fingers

276
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,160
and show them to you.

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,760
♫ The plane flew by
and left a trail behind ♫

278
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,760
♫ Perhaps the sky wants to flash a smile ♫

279
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,120
Let me help you.

280
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,840
No, no, no.

281
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I'll do it. Let me.

282
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,450
I'll do it by myself.

283
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes.

284
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,970
Stir-fry it.

285
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
It's burnt.

286
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
Let's try it again.

287
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,720
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

288
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,040
♫ I've lost count ♫

289
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,120
♫ Gradually get used to the new date ♫

290
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,920
[If Tang Ping hadn't shown up suddenly,]

291
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,400
[things wouldn't turn out like this.]

292
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,560
[She had put a lot of thought into it]

293
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,560
[She came up with all sorts of plans]

294
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,400
[she didn't want to cause you any trouble.]

295
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,080
♫ And decided to travel there ♫

296
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,640
♫ To hold you ♫

297

♫ To hold you tight ♫

298
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,800
Look. I have some money.

299
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm going to give you all my money.

300
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,370
I... I don't want it.

301
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,680
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

302
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,760
Fangning.

303
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,560
♫ The wind passed through the window
and kissed me on my cheeks ♫

304
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,880
♫ Asking gently, how are you? ♫

305
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,680
♫ The plane flew by

♫ Perhaps the sky wants to flash a smile ♫

307
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,440
♫ The softness in my heart was touched ♫

308
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,640
♫ The number of dreams
I've had since your departure ♫

309
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,160
♫ I waited till dawn
the first time I want to see you ♫

310
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,680
♫ Want to see you
the second time Control emotion ♫

311
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,680
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

312
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,400
Do you not like me at all?

313
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,730
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

314
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,280
♫ How many times have I wanted to see you ♫

315

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Okay, it's done.

320
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,440
Gosh, I'm hungry.

321
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,440
How about you?

322
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,560
Me too.

323
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:26,840
Come on,

324
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,240
Dr. Ling, Dr. Liu,

325
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,000
Dr. Peng,

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,730
Nurse Wang,

327
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,320
please come here.

328
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,440
Thank you for your hard work.

329
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,960
Have some water.

330
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,680
Thank you.

331
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,480
Thank you

332
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,640
for volunteering at our plant.

333
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Come on, have some water.

334
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,560
Thank you.

335
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
Thank you for your hard work.

336
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
Take a break first.

337
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,080
We'll continue at 1:30 in the afternoon.

338
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay. Please have lunch

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,010
in our cafeteria now.

340
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,600
Don't underestimate

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,560
our cafeteria.

342
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,960
The chef

343
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
was specially invited by

344
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,480
Jiang Cheng Group.

345
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,160
He's very good at Sichuan cuisine.

346
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,680
The factory under Jiang Cheng Group

347
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,890
is also here?

348
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,730
Yes.

349
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,240
The whole area belongs to Jiang Cheng Group.

350
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,360
Amend these again.

351
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,490
Okay.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,010
You guys may go first.

353
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,850
Okay. Okay.

354
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,000
Dr. Ling,

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,080
what a coincidence.

356
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,320
Hi, Ms. Qin.

357
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,320
I happened to be giving
free medical consultations nearby.

358
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
It's not exactly a coincidence.

359
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,120
I want to talk to you.

360
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
Talk to me?

361
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,160
Are you here

362
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,000
to speak for Fangning

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
this time?

364
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
I don't know what happened

365
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
between you two in business.

366
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm not trying to persuade you.

367
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
But I want to do

368
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,530
something for her.

369
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,880
Since I happened

370
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,200
to meet you here.

371
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,320
Sometimes, I do

372
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,770
envy Lu Fangning.

373
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,450
She speaks her mind

374
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,520
and is comfortable in her own skin.

375
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,130
Now,

376
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,680
she has a good husband like you.

377
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,040
No one can really understand

378
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,760
other people's lives.

379
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,400
Maybe

380
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,360
she envies you, Ms. Qin.

381
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,680
Did she tell you that?

382
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,360
I don't believe it.

383
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
Maybe

384
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,170
she likes you.

385
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,520
She likes me?

386
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,160
What does she like about me?

387
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,320
Both of you

388
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
share many similarities.

389
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,930
Lately,

390
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I don't think

391
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,840
I know myself very well.

392
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,320
What do I look like?

393
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,770
What do I really want?

394
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,360
Perhaps, it's not that you don't know yourself.

395
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,760
You are just afraid to face yourself.

396
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
Ms. Qin, do you know?

397
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,760
Fever

398
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
is actually a way for the body

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,640
to protect and repair itself.

400
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,800
It's the white blood cells

401
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,120
fighting against viruses and bacteria.

402
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
When they win,

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
the symptoms will go away naturally.

404
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
The immune system will also be strengthened.

405
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,160
So, instead of forcing the fever down,

406
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,490
leaving it alone

407
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,320
maybe better.

408
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,800
You don't have to worry

409
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,120
or be afraid.

410
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,050
Humans are strong.

411
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
When you heal,

412
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,850
you will naturally become a better person.

413
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,480
What are you trying to say?

414
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,770
I want to say that

415
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,760
I hope Ms. Qin can

416
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,000
recover soon.

417
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,880
Consider it as my heartfelt thanks.

418
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
For not making Fangning bear the harm

419
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,240
that was brought upon you in the past.

420
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,680
These are the factory's production line data

421
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,600
that you have submitted

422
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
and the results of our review.

423
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,720
Is that so?

424
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,280
Is there any difference?

425
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
This number is different by 0.01.

426
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,680
The factory was being careless.

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,160
They are too irresponsible.

428
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,640
I'll question them.

429
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
Director Lu,

430
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,160
in my opinion,

431
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,090
Manager Wang is still reluctant

432
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,880
to tell the truth.

433
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
However,

434
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,200
I've recorded

435
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
what he just said.

436
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,720
As evidence, it should be enough.

437
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,400
Bring the recording and these materials

438
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
to the lawyer.

439
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Ask him to look into it.

440
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,840
Director Lu.

441
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I was wrong.

442
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Please let me off this time.

443
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,920
Just this once.

444
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
I'll find a new factory right away.

445
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Listen to yourself.

446
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,560
You should have realized your mistakes

447
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,200
before you did it.

448
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
Director Lu, I didn't want it to happen either.

449
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,570
This tiny difference

450
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,040
are negligible.

451
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,040
Otherwise,

452
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,120
I'll return all the money that

453
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,480
I've received.

454
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
I can even return the money to the company.

455
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,690
I mean it, Director Lu.

456
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,960
I have realized my mistake now.

457
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,040
I promise.

458
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,050
I promise to be loyal to the company

459
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,960
and work extra hard

460
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
from now on.

461
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,450
It seems that your problem

462
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,330
is more serious than I thought.

463
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,520
What?

464
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,640
Although we

465
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,120
found out that data was wrong,

466
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,280
we don't have any direct evidence

467
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,200
to prove that you took bribes.

468
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,400
Now that you've admitted it yourself,

469
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
we can only leave the rest

470
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,160
to the lawyer and the police.

471
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,680
Lu Yiyao,

472
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,890
you played tricks with me?

473
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,520
We didn't expect that

474
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,120
you would show your hand so easily.

475
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,120
Get him out of here.

476
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,280
Lu Yiyao!

477
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,640
Please go.

478
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,640
Lu Yiyao, you've crossed the line!

479
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,400
Lu Yiyao!

480
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,840
Lu Yiyao, you'll be sorry!

481
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,000
The terms of cooperation are better than before.

482
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,760
After all,

483
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,480
it's my problem this time.

484
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,080
I refuse.

485
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
With such preferential prices,

486
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,240
it'll be difficult for you

487
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,480
to find other suppliers.

488
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
I will find one.

489
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
How about quality assurance?

490
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,840
You have to think about it carefully.

491
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,600
In such a short period,

492
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
it's hard for you

493
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,440
to find this kind of manufacturing technology

494
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,240
with such an inexpensive rate.

495
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,040
There is always a solution.

496
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,720
I certainly believe in Jiang Cheng.

497
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
But, Yujiang,

498
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,440
you're the one who broke the rules of the game.

499
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,280
You broke the contract and re-signed it at will.

500
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Deer Sing Group

501
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
doesn't need such an emotional partner

502
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,200
who can't make a clear distinction
between public and private interests.

503
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,960
Ten years ago,

504
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,320
Simon made a mistake.

505
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,840
But ten years later,

506
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
it was you who used the wrong method.

507
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,200
I've adjusted the product design

508
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
for Infinity's main series.

509
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,010
I don't need Jiang Cheng anymore.

510
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,160
And I won't be threatened by anyone.

511
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,120
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,210
It's really my problem this time.

513
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,360
I hope

514
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,960
we still have the opportunity
to work with Deer Sing again.

515
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,040
This is a new manufacturer.

516
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,920
I know the owner.

517
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
He's a decent person.

518
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,040
This information should be useful to you.

519
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,120
This

520
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,170
accords with your

521
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,280
game rules, right?

522
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,320
Okay.

523
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,320
I accept it.

524
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,880
However,

525
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,000
please don't tell Lu Yiyao that

526
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
I provided this line.

527
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,810
Are you really

528
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,240
not going to give it a try?

529
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,120
My uncle is single.

530
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,920
You're single too.

531
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,690
No.

532
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
He has a special place in his heart

533
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,920
where I can neither enter nor ignore.

534
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,440
To ensure my well-being

535
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,840
for the rest of my life,

536
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,800
forget it.

537
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,080
Does he have a girlfriend abroad?

538
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
In this world,

539
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,040
there is only one person

540
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
who can make him cry

541
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,280
and make him laugh.

542
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,880
But this is his secret.

543
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,440
I can't tell anyone.

544
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,730
Well,

545
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,560
it's a pity.

546
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,240
I'm quite satisfied

547
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,080
with you as my aunt.

548
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,760
You can help me make money.

549
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm leaving.

550
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,080
You should thank Ling Rui.

551
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,280
Ling Rui?

552
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
He was giving free medical consultations
in our factory area.

553
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,640
He came to see me.

554
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,800
He said he wanted to do something for you.

555
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,720
You must have lived miserably

556
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,000
in your previous life.

557
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,160
That's why God compensates you

558
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,120
with Ling Rui in this life.

559
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm leaving.

560
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,800
You have something to tell me, haven't you?

561
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,360
The weather is nice today.

562
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,170
Let's go.

563
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,600
Okay.

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
When I passed by here,

565
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,760
I thought of our dates before.

566
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,360
Besides having dinners, watching movies,

567
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,320
and listening to music concerts,

568
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,440
we didn't seem to do

569
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,600
anything else.

570
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,720
Do you remember

571
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
what other things we did?

572
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,720
I don't think we did.

573
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,680
Right?

574
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
That's why I feel unfair.

575
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,400
I can't

576
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,360
get rid of that feeling.

577
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,490
Lu Yiyao,

578
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,040
were you surprised to find that

579
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,520
I would like you so much?

580
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,360
I want to know the truth.

581
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,160
Back then,

582
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,480
I thought

583
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,560
you find us perfect for each other.

584
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,920
But now...

585
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,120
you probably hate my guts.

586
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,120
I knew it.

587
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,520
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,920
Actually, you know what?

589
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,160
You just have to say

590
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,560
or do something

591
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
and I'll be fine.

592
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,600
I'll forgive you.

593
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,160
Forget it.

594
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,520
I hate myself so much

595
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,560
when I act like this.

596
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,200
Until now,

597
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,010
I still can't

598
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,240
express my feelings frankly.

599
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,600
I can only pretend to blame you

600
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,730
because it's easier than blaming myself.

601
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,400
That's okay.

602
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,440
You can continue to blame me.

603
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,520
Forget it.

604
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,240
I'll forget you.

605
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,880
Yujiang.

606
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
Lu Yiyao,

607
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,000
just stay here.

608
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm leaving.

609
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,280
Simon.

610
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
There is only one person in this world

611
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
who can make him cry

612
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,000
and make him laugh.

613
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,480
Since her sister died,

614
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Fangning locked herself inside

615
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
for several days.

616
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,290
She doesn't eat.

617
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,720
She doesn't cry or make a scene.

618
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,880
Something's going to happen to her.

619
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,040
My sister gave me this candy.

620
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,120
She wanted my future life

621
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,040
to be sweet.

622
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But I can't see her anymore.

623
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,800
Aunt Gao,

624
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,720
what are you doing?

625
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,680
Where's uncle?

626
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,760
I don't know what happened.

627
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,120
He said he was leaving all of a sudden.

628
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,400
He packed his baggage quickly

629
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,240
and left.

630
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,520
He also said that
he will call off the engagement.

631
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,680
Fangning.

632
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,400
You're back.

633
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,440
I put the contact information
of the new manufacturer

634
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,560
on your desk.

635
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,000
This manufacturer was recommended
by someone else?

636
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
An acquaintance recommended it.

637
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,800
You can contact them.

638
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,720
Proceed with the project as soon as possible.

639
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm busy. I got to go.

640
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,800
Wait a minute.

641
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,680
Are you okay?

642
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm fine.

643
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,240
I'm fine. I have to go.

644
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,040
Look, he's calling now.

645
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,190
[Lu Yiyao]

646
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,359
Why did you invite Fangning?

647
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,570
I remember the last time

648
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,410
the three of us gathered

649
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,450
was probably when

650
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,320
I was having a blind date.

651
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,839
If Fangning hadn't

652
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,000
let me off the hook at that time,

653
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,399
I'm afraid I wouldn't have had the chance

654
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,919
to be Yiyao's girlfriend.

655
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,080
Yiyao,

656
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,480
as her uncle,

657
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,879
you should reflect on yourself.

658
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,250
Do you have other wine?

659
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,359
Open another bottle.

660
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:47,680
[Fangning,]

661
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,839
[since the production line's problems]

662
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,879
[have been solved,]

663
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,640
[should we find time to celebrate it?]

664
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,120
[It's fine.]

665
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,040
[I'm quite busy these days.]

666
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,040
[How about next week?]

667
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:58,800
[Let's talk about it next week.]

668
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,080
Cai Siyu.

669
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,240
Director Lu.

670
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Let's have dinner together after work.

671
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Cai Siyu.

672
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,160
Ms. Lu,

673
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,650
when did you get along so well

674
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,440
with Simon that

675
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,640
you are having dinner together?

676
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,560
You're right.

677
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,960
When?

678
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,240
Hasn't the story already ended?

679
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,000
[I hope I'm overthinking it.]

680
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Could it be that I just need to
have a crush on a company director

681
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,080
and a director will be granted to me?

682
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
I don't have to do anything

683
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
and Director Lu just came up to me?

684
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
What are you thinking about?

685
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
What did you say?

686
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,640
Came up to you?

687
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,600
Did you buy a lottery ticket?

688
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,480
I…

689
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
Do nothing...

690
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,800
Come up to me...

691
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,570
[Deer Sing Group]

692
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,770
Are we really going to do this?

693
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,840
We're already here.

694
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
No more crap.

695
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,360
He burned the bridges for your factory.

696
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,800
He got us into trouble with the lawsuit.

697
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Lu Yiyao

698
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,240
burned our bridges.

699
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
We have nothing to lose.

700
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Here he comes.

701
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,760
Get ready to go!

702
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
What do all of you want?

703
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,320
Get him!

704
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,640
Hit him hard!

705
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,360
Security!

706
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,280
Security!

707
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
They're here! Hurry!

708
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,720
Let's go.

709
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,160
Director Lu, are you okay?

710
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm sorry that I came late.

711
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,400
You shouted quite loudly.

712
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
It was an emergency.

713
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,120
You...

714
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,640
Next time, you should run

715
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,560
and get someone here, understand?

716
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,000
There will be no next time.

717
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,240
Are you okay?

718
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,480
Shall we call the police
or go to the hospital first?

719
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,640
No need to call the police.

720
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,240
I'll handle it by myself.

721
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,040
Then, how about your wound?

722
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,640
Thank you.

723
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,160
I'll do it.

724
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,480
It's fine. Let me help you.

725
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,760
Another classic scene,

726
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,080
I've made it.

727
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,560
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

728
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,640
I'll do it gently.

729
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,920
I think you are smiling.

730
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
No, I'm not.

731
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,360
You're my boss.

732
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,440
You're injured.

733
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,480
I worry about you a lot.

734
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,240
Of course,

735
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,080
I have some other thoughts.

736
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,520
Director Lu,

737
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,920
I want to know

738
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,640
what do you think of me.

739
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,720
Why...

740
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,760
Why did you suddenly invite me to dinner?

741
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,240
Nothing.

742
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,130
You have been working overtime

743
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,560
so I wanted to show my appreciation.

744
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,000
It's okay. I'll do it by myself.

745
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,560
What's wrong?

746
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,050
All right, it's late.

747
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,000
You should go home now.

748
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,210
Director Lu,

749
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,160
do you really

750
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,120
have nothing to tell me?

751
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,320
I don't feel like saying it today.

752
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,440
Maybe another day.

753
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,400
You have the chance now.

754
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm leaving.

755
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,880
Director Lu,

756
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,040
it's okay if you don't feel like saying it.

757
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,040
I'll say it.

758
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
I know that

759
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
you need to put in the effort

760
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,890
for a relationship to work.

761
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,800
That is how it's like in the novels.

Director Lu,

763
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,640
I like you.

764
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,320
Can you be my boyfriend?

765
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,360
You don't have to answer me now.

766
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,200
I'll head home now.

767
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,040
Shouldn't he stop me by now?

768
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
Why doesn't he stop me?

769
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,040
Come on!

770
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,760
All right.
