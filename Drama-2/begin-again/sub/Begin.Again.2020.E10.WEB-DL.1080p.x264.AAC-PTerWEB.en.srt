[Episode 10]

4
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,450
What a "perfect" timing.

5
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,530
She chose today to have dinner with us.

6
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,690
How am I supposed to face Ling Rui?

7
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,370
Today is just...

8
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,010
Just a dinner.

9
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,450
It's part of my job.

10
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,440
Qin Yujiang,

11
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,650
the ex-fiancee of Simon,

12
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,370
is a very important partner

13
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,410
for Deer Sing.

14
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,529
So today's dinner

15
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,890
is kind of important to me.

16
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,010
Okay.

17
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,330
Sorry to bother you

18
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,690
to come to have dinner with me.

19
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,040
It's alright.

20
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,970
-Um...
-Um...

21
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,240
You go first.

22
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,529
Shall we go inside?

23
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,650
That's what I was gonna say.

24
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,330
Let's go.

25
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,170
Okay.

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,690
Yujiang.

27
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,050
I've been waiting for you.

28
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,050
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

29
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,050
Thanks.

30
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,450
He is my husband, Ling Rui.

31
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,010
Hello, Yujiang.

32
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,890
You indeed make a good match.

33
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,010
Fangning, it's been a while
since the last time

34
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,810
we took a picture together.

35
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,610
Let's take a picture.

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,450
Sure.

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,810
Okay.

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,120
Come on in. This way.

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,040
-Alright.
-Let's go.

40
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,890
Ling Rui looks good.

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,490
Fangning surely has good taste.

42
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,410
Have a seat.

43
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,210
Nice decoration.

44
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:51,770
Here.

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,890
Yujiang.

46
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,090
What's taking Simon so long?

47
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,370
Do I have to invite him?

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,650
Just kidding.

49
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,650
He'll be here in a minute.

50
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,240
How's it going?

51
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,530
Quite good.

52
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,770
Look, he just called.

Yujiang.

55
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,210
What do you want?

56
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,450
Why did you invite Fangning?

57
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,610
Simon,

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,210
we're all here.

59
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,560
We're waiting for you now. Hurry up.

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,570
Don't keep us waiting here.

61
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,770
Although I didn't give you a heads up,

62
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,010
you don't have to be so anxious.

63
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,010
Fangning and Ling Rui have arrived.

64
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,210
You're the last one. Hurry up.

65
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,210
He has become

66
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,770
more and more impatient now.

67
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,609
Yujiang, I'm sorry,

68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,290
but I have to ask.

69
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,570
Are you and Simon okay?

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,490
Because I think that

71
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,210
it'll be more appropriate
for us two to discuss

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,690
the cooperation between
Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,090
I had a good talk with Yiyao.

74
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,690
Why would you think so?

75
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,690
Don't worry.

76
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,850
Our partnership will work.

77
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,320
You can sit here. I'll open the wine

78
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,050
and get it prepared.

79
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,970
Thanks.

80
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,290
What did she mean by that?

81
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,450
It's appropriate? It will work?

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,090
That sounds so strange.

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,410
It's not like they're back together.

84
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,090
Is she trying to

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,800
settle scores at an opportune moment?

86
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,360
How is this? Do you guys like it?

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,560
Your helper has great cooking skills.

88
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,440
Come here anytime if you like.

89
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,320
You are late.

90
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,450
Uncle.

91
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,130
You need to drink
as a punishment.

92
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,090
Come sit down.

93
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,050
I'll tell you what.

94
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,930
Fangning is fortunate

95
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,330
to have met someone like Ling Rui.

96
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,050
What took you so long?

97
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,730
Come on. Welcome you all,

98
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,530
especially Dr. Ling.

99
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,210
Uncle?

100
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,170
Fangning, you need to drive.

101
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,170
You can't drink.

102
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,560
-I'll drink for you.
-You can drive too.

103
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,210
I have night blindness.

104
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,280
You're night blind?

105
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,050
Yeah, exactly.

106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,090
He's night blind.

107
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,010
Cheers.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,330
Uncle.

109
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,130
Thank you for your hospitality.

110
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,090
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

111
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,290
The last time

112
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,330
the three of us got together

113
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,400
was when

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,490
I went on a blind date.

115
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,560
If Fangning hadn't

116
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,530
cut me some slack,

117
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm afraid I couldn't have got a chance

118
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,290
to be Yiyao's girlfriend.

119
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,570
Dr. Ling,

120
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,970
how did you two meet?

121
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,770
Fate.

122
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,450
When it's the right time,

123
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,290
you'll naturally meet the right person.

124
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,610
We have friends in common.

125
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,210
So what do you love about Fangning?

126
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,130
He likes me because I'm pretty, gorgeous,

127
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,570
noble, independent,

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,330
smart,

129
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,650
and very rich.

130
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,330
Of course,

131
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,490
it'll take more than a mealtime

132
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,610
to talk about all my strength.

133
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,090
Right?

134
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,210
I like her because

135
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,930
sometimes she's heedless,

136
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,650
fearless,

137
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,330
unreasonable,

138
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,650
and occasionally

139
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,010
reckless.

140
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:49,770
She is like a shooting star

141
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,680
who came into my unexceptional life.

142
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,770
After hearing your description of me,

143
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,880
why do I feel like

144
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,609
I'm a giant octopus?

145
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,170
How lucky Fangning is.

146
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,210
Well, he's lucky, too.

147
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,850
Didn't you say you liked me

148
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,970
being reckless and unreasonable?

149
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,050
Why are you avoiding me?

150
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,890
I thought you said you're like an octopus.

151
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,730
I don't like an octopus.

152
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,850
Fangning.

153
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,370
It's healthy to eat more greens.

154
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,970
Thank you.

155
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,010
You're welcome.

156
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,609
I remember that Fangning

157
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:42,330
never liked to eat

158
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,730
all these vegetables.

159
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,290
Apparently, she changed her taste

160
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,970
after getting married.

161
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,369
Yiyao.

162
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,810
As her uncle,

163
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,210
I think you should reflect on yourself.

164
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,410
I don't really like the wine today.

165
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,290
Well...

166
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,170
Any other wine?

167
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Let's open another bottle.

168
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,850
Why are you avoiding me?

169
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,410
I'm not.

170
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,930
Yes, you are.

171
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:26,850
Look, look.

172
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,970
You are avoiding me right now.

173
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,530
I've had enough.

174
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,250
I'm done with playing

175
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,330
reserved tonight.

176
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,810
Why are you avoiding me?

177
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,970
I got it.

178
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,050
It's because

179
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,010
we didn't make a deal that night.

180
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,890
That's why you're avoiding me.

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,770
You know it clearly that

182
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,720
I would love to make this work.

183
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,130
Let's change the topic, Fangning.

184
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,410
Ling Rui.

185
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,690
You're not cut out for coquetry,
Lu Fangning.

186
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,450
I'll go to the washroom.

187
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,250
The washroom?

188
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,890
Can you solve

189
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,850
our problem then?

190
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,200
Yujiang.

191
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,290
What are you doing?

192
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,930
Can't you see it?

193
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,770
Well, think again.

194
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,810
I don't want to think.

195
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,050
You tell me now.

196
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,730
You are always like this.

197
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,330
Whatever she asks you to do,

198
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,490
you'll try everything you could.

199
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,690
But you never paid
even the slightest attention

200
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,160
to what I asked you to do.

201
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,530
I thought it was strange.

202
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,570
Now I know.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,930
You're in love with someone

204
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,930
you can't love.

205
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,720
So it doesn't matter

206
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,890
who you get married with.

207
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,290
I just happened to show up,

208
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,330
and happened to be the perfect fit

209
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,090
to become your perfect wife.

210
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,290
You didn't need to

211
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,080
pay any effort.

212
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,450
Yujiang.

213
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,530
Lu Yiyao.

214
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,530
Although you don't know me,

215
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
I know you very well.

216
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,690
Ever since we got engaged,

217
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,130
how many times
we should dine together every week,

218
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,490
how many times you should send me flowers,

219
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,200
when you should send me gifts
for our anniversary,

220
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,610
and drive me home.

221
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,970
On all these things,
you've never made a mistake.

222
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,130
But she's the only reason that

223
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,490
you would ignore

224
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,800
all the standards regardless,

225
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,050
and call off the engagement

226
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,530
with a single text message.

227
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,570
If it wasn't for Lu Fangning,

228
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,370
would it be anyone else?

229
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,250
So you invited them here today

230
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,890
to tell her all the truth

231
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,930
or to threaten me?

232
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,450
Lu Yiyao,

233
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,850
you underestimated me.

234
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,770
I just wanted to see

235
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,010
how rattled you are.

236
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,050
You didn't let me down.

237
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,170
Ling Rui is indeed a great man.

238
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,490
I think they are a perfect match.

239
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,170
Well, aren't you disappointed?

240
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,650
I'm not disappointed.

241
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,090
I just want her to be happy.

242
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,730
No.

243
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,880
What you want is

244
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,490
to bring her happiness yourself.

245
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm the one who made the mistake.

246
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,690
I don't want her involved.

247
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,010
Okay.

248
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,330
Well, in that case,

249
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm gonna give you a chance.

250
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,170
I've changed my mind, Lu Yiyao.

251
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,010
You can either make yourself

252
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,530
fall for me truly,

253
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,170
or I'm gonna tell her

254
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,570
why exactly did you call off

255
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,730
your engagement ten years ago,

256
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,570
and who's the person

257
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,690
you truly loved

258
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,010
deep down.

259
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,650
You're done?

260
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,490
When are we gonna try again?

261
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,970
Lu Fangning, I have to tell you...

262
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,970
Try it again.

263
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,330
Come, try the cake I baked.

264
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,010
You know how to bake.

265
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,690
Thank you.

266
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,850
But, I think

267
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,930
you like fruit cakes, right?

268
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,210
It's alright.

269
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,090
I've always wanted to try

270
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,210
some other cakes.

271
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,450
When I was a kid, I wanted something new,

272
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,090
so I said that I liked fruit cake.

273
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,970
From then on, there had been

274
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,170
only fruit cakes at home.

275
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,930
No other options.

276
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,010
Yummy.

277
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,290
Fangning.

278
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,250
Didn't you just tell me that

279
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,570
your stomach hurt

280
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,290
and you wanted to go home?

281
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,330
Me?

282
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,010
My stomach hurts.

283
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,530
You just told me.

284
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,250
Yeah, it hurts.

285
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,210
It just came out of nowhere.

286
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,850
I'm so sorry.

287
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,970
We should probably go first.

288
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,610
Simon.

289
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,970
Sorry, Yujiang.

290
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,610
Thank you for your hospitality today.

291
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,960
She's always like this.

292
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,330
We're gonna go home.

293
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,450
It's okay. I'll walk you out.

294
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,290
What a pity, all these foods.

295
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,130
-Are you alright?
-I'm okay.

296
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:33,970
Come on.

297
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,010
You okay?

298
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,850
Watch the steps.

299
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,360
Drive carefully.

300
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,570
Thank you for the dinner.

301
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,530
Ms. Qin.

302
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,890
We shall excuse ourselves first.

303
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,250
Bye.

304
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,290
Bye.

305
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,770

306
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:34,650
Ling Rui.

307
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,130
Thank you for today.

308
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,730
It's alright.

309
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,330
Fangning.

310
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,730
Uncle.

311
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,770
Well, I've got to go.

312
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,090
You two get some rest early.

313
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,920
Uncle.

314
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,530
Are you alright?

315
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,170
-I'm fine.
-Fangning.

316
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,850
Flies.

317
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,050
Are there flies in this season?

318
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,530
There's so much greenery here.

319
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,930
Of course, there are flies.

320
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,490
Simon.

321
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,610
In short,

322
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,490
I hope you don't take that too personally.

323
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,810
I'm leaving.

324
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,170
You didn't drive here, right?
Let me drive you home.

325
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,410
Alright.

326
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,530
-Let's go.
-Fangning.

327
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,050
I have something to tell you.

328
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,730
What is it?

329
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,570
I'll take a cab.

330
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,010
Uh...

331
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,570
Bye.

332
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,690
Be careful, uncle.

333
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,440
What's up?

334
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,530
Let me answer it first.

335
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,050
Hi.

336
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,050
Friday?

337
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,570
Reunion?

338
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,530
Will Mr. Yu be there?

339
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,650
If he'll be there,

340
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,010
then I'll go, too.

341
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,130
Bye.

342
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,370
So,

343
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,690
what did you want to tell me just now?

344
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,810
You look good today.

345
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,370
Thank you.

346
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,130
Nothing else?

347
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,090
Nope.

348
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,530
Well, I'm leaving then.

349
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,650
Drive carefully.

350
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,890
What did he mean?

351
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,210
He likes it this way?

352
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,250
Why is he still avoiding me?

353
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,810
Can we talk it through or not?

355
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,570
Is he avoiding me?

356
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,810
Does he dislike me?

357
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,250
That's impossible.

358
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,090
How could anyone dislike me?

359
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,930
Am I not pretty enough?

360
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,570
I am pretty indeed.

361
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,770
He can't dislike me.

362
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,970
I can't try it again.

363
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,049
What does he want then?

364
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,279
Are we gonna continue the contract or not?

365
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,490
Or should I get another man?

366
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,650
Ms. Lu, Ms. Qin from Jiang Cheng Group

367
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,170
insists on meeting with you.

368
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,330
She should be here any minute.

369
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,730
Okay.

370
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,250
These prices are okay.

371
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,730
This one's too high.

372
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,600
Alright,

373
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,690
I'll talk to them again

374
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,490
and try to keep the costs down.

375
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,050
Alright.

376
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,850
Give me a minute.

377
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,930
Hello.

378
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,290
She's going to meet Ms. Lu?

379
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,410
Okay, I got it.

380
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,370
Are you alright?

[LM Deer Sing Group]

429
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,690
I've checked on the manufacturers

430
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,010
that we could find

431
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,250
in this city and nearby.

432
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,250
But the

433
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,930
manufacturing process

434
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,850
is special,

435
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,210
all the materials should
be consistent with

436
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,090
environmental standards,

437
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,010
and subject to strict

438
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,890
quality control.

439
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,570
Every product,
from material to finished product,

440
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,570
has to go through a rigorous operation of

441
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,450
over a hundred procedures.

442
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,840
So a large portion of the manufacturers

443
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,650
find it difficult to finish

444
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,490

but the price they quoted

449
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,450
is 20% more expensive than

450
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,210
Jiang Cheng's.

451
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,050
How about the further factories?

452
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,600
We've also consulted

453

454
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,890
The freight

455
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,370
is going to bring up
our costs significantly.

456
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,690
In this case,

457
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,210
if we force it into production,

458
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,730
Deer Sing's fund flow would become

459
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,650
very difficult to handle.

Infinity's launching date

465
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,130
might have to be postponed.

466
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,970
I don't think it matters.

467
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,490

It's not a good time to postpone it.

472
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,210
Well, here is the thing. In the beginning,

473
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,970
there will be some

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:50,970
But by the time

If we postpone its launch now,

482

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,850
You don't even know

575
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,530
why...

576
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,850
But he was still handsome.

577
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,970
Come on.

578
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,370
Don't I look good in it?

579
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,770
Does he look as good as me?

580
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,330
You're just jealous.

581
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,610
Who are you talking about?

582
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,290
Curly.

583
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,570
Curly Peng.

584
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,290
Don't call me that, okay?

585
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,770
Either you call me Dr. Peng,

586
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,530
or just Curly.

587
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,410
Who's Curly Peng?

588
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,610
Look at yourself.

589
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,930
Has your curly hair ever changed?

590
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,280
I'm so jealous.

591
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,210
Don't get your hands on me.

592
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,210
Control yourself.

593
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,890
You've become bolder.

594
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,770
This must be Ling Rui.

595
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,600
We're supposed to call you

596
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
-It's Ling Rui.
-Dr. Ling now, right?

597
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,250
Hello.

598
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,930
Guys, Dr. Ling is here.

599
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,140
-Ling Rui.
-Dr. Ling.

600
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,970
Come and sit here.

601
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,450
Sit down.

602
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,530
Dr. Ling,

603
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,490
are you working for the internal medicine

604
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,650
or the surgery department?

605
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,810
I'm a surgeon.

606
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,890
Surgeon.

607
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,010
Do you do heart operations?

608
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,050
Don't only have him

609
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,450
in your eyes, okay?

610
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,970
Am I not handsome? Why don't look at me?

611
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,410
You? Forget it.

612
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,050
Ling Rui is more handsome.

613
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,610
Exactly.

614
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,250
Well, where's Mr. Yu?

615
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,930
Mr. Yu?

616
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,810
He hasn't arrived yet.

617
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,210
We're all

618
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,570
classmates.

619
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,250
Yeah, let's get together sometime.

620
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,360
But if Mr. Yu knows that

621
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,970
Ling Rui is here,

622
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,170
he's gonna fly here.

623
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,090
He is slow, okay?

624
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,200
I'll give him a call.

625
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,970
We must get together sometime.

626
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,010
After all, we're classmates.

627
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,650
Hi, Mr. Yu.

628
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,010
But we're classmates and old friends.

629
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,650
Alright.

630
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,760
Alright.

631
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,930
Look,

632
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,800
Mr. Yu got lost.

633
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm gonna go pick him up.

634
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,650
Why don't you come with me?

635
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,770
-I'll go, too.
-No.

636
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,330
Don't go.

637
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,610
You just go by yourself.

638
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,530
Leave Ling Rui with us.

639
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,170
Exactly.

640
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,650
Are you afraid that we're gonna eat him?

641
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,570
Hey, guys.

642
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,530
Ling Rui hasn't seen

643
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,290
Mr. Yu for a long time.

644
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,370
He misses him so much.

645
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,170
How about this?

646
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,250
Let him pick up Mr. Yu.

647
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,130
And I'll chat with you.

648
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:25,970
I can talk too, right?

649
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,090
-No, no.
-I don't want that.

650
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,730
We haven't seen Ling Rui

651
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,770
for a long time too.

652
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,650
-We all miss him so much. Right?
-Exactly.

653
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,610
I'll take him away.

654
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,330
Curly, you...

655
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:34,890
So annoying.

656
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,610
Let's get out of here.

657
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,090
Or they are gonna

658
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,680
eat you up.

659
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,520
What are you doing?

660
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,090
Take care of the boys too.

661
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,840
Alright?

662
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,930
We want Ling Rui.

663
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,360
We are all classmates.

664
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,970
Why all the differences?

665
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,890
We just want Ling Rui.

666
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,290
You're not as handsome as he is.
Don't speak.

667
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,130
-Oh my.
-That can't be changed.

668
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,850
We're both so good-looking.

669
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,410
Why...

670
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,730
Mr. Yu, this way.

671
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,810
Mind your steps.

672
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,490
Ling Rui,

673
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,850
are you usually that busy?

674
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,690
I haven't seen you

675
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,890
for so many years.

676
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,610
You didn't say this

677
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,890
when you saw Ling Rui just now.

678
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,530
I mean, he just put on an act.

679
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,250
Which one of you here

680
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,290
doesn't know that?

681
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,010
We all know

682
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,770
how he used to be like?

683
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,370
What's wrong with that?

684
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,530
He is handsome all the time,

685
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,330
okay?

686
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,410
You women are so shallow.

687
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,760
What else could you care about
other than his pretty face?

688
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,970
His face is enough.

689
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,810
Listen to me,

690
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,330
Mr. Yu called on the entire class

691
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,810
to help poor students.

692
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,210
I donated him

693
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,970
a down jacket.

694
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,410
I wonder

695
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,250
if he still wears it.

696
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,490
Come on.

697
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,410
He is a surgeon

698
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,530
at a major hospital.

699
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,650
Why wear your cheap down jacket?

700
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,290
The other day,

701
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,850
I heard from another doctor
at Ling Rui's hospital.

702
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,450
They met his wife

703
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,920
who looks very rich.

704
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,450
Her bag,

705
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,890
and her clothes...

706
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,250
How much salary can

707
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,290
Ling Rui earn every month?

708
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,730
They don't even care about
that little amount of money.

709
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,250
You know?

710
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,250
See? What I was saying?

711
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,410
What did I tell you?

712
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,250
When I came in, he was like

713
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,170
"Hello."

714
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,240
I mean, who was he trying to fool?

715
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,010
I'll tell you what.

716
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,650
With a rich wife,

717
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,690
life is easy.

718
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,450
He was just lucky.

719
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,890
What's the big deal?

720
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,690
Who is this?

721
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,530
Who are you looking for?

722
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,610
Do you know her?

723
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,610
Excuse me.

724
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,290
For me, Lu Fangning,

725
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,290
Ling Rui is quite amazing.

726
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,330
Who are you?

727
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,370
I'm Ling Rui's wife,

728
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,210
Lu Fangning.

729
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,930
If you don't know,

730
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,930
you can search for my name online.

731
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,610
Thanks.

732
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,690
He brought his wife

733
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,570
Fangning.

734
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,410
to the reunion?

735
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,570
This wine

736
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,210
is so terrible.

737
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,290
After all, this is a reunion.

738
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,530
How could you drink such terrible wine

739
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,650
with your teacher?

740
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,770
I'll have my assistant

741
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,770
get two bottles of fine wine

742
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,490
from my personal cellar

743
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,810
to celebrate with you all.

744
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,050
I was just wondering

745
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,730
why you had to invite Ling Rui.

746
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,250
It turns out you want him to pay the bill.

747
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,810
What do you mean?

748
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,130
How could she say something like that?

749
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,890
Forget it, Fangning.

750
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,810
You're Lu Fangning.

751
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,690
She's Lu Fangning,

752
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,450
who is very rich.

753
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,290
This lady,

754
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,050
please mind your behavior

755
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,000
and don't ruin

756
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,450
our reunion party.

757
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,520
What?

758
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,090
Who is exactly rude?

759
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,130
Can't you see that?

760
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,610
You're all here for the reunion.

761
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,290
Some people are just

762
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,170
speaking ill of others.

763
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,370
Are that good manners?

764
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,290
Are they?

765
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:36,810
By the way,

766
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,250
you're the classmate

767
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,970
who gave clothes to Ling Rui,

768
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,530
right?

769
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,410
It occurred to me that

770
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,410
I meant to throw away the jacket

771
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,770
for so many times,

772
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,320
but Ling Rui didn't allow me to do so.

773
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,450
I can see that it really means a lot

774
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,890
to Ling Rui.

775
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,130
But I've changed my mind.

776
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,170
When we get back today,

777
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,010
I'm gonna use that jacket

778
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,290
to make a nest for our Doudou.

779
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,050
By the way,

780
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,330
Doudou is our dog.

781
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,450
What do you mean?

782
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,890
What do you mean, Ling Rui?

783
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,160
You got a rich wife, that's fine.

784
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,570
But now you have your wife

785
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,850
humiliating your old friends?

786
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,290
I'm not humiliating you all.

787
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,290
I'm only humiliating

788
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,450
the two of you.

789
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,770
But you know what,

790
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,370
it should be an honor to you

791
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,450
to have a chance

792
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,890
to be humiliated by me.

793
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,330
Just so you know,

794
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,290
it's not easy
to get Ling Rui to depend on me.

795
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,810
I was gonna give him

796
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,050
tens of millions

797
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,920
He refused it and called me shallow.

798
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,760
It took me so much effort

799
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,970
to get him to depend on me.

800
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,530
Even if he's gonna make this place

801
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,410
a mess,

802
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm gonna let him do it.
What can you say about that?

803
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,130
A mess, huh?

804
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,330
Just do it!

805
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,570
What are you doing?

806
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,850
What?

807
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,680
It's alright, teacher.

808
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,770
Ling Rui's got this.

809
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,450
But I don't wanna make it

810
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,440
a mess.

811
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,120
Let's go.

812
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,890
Are you alright?

813
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm angry.

814
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,930
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry.

815
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,970
Ling Rui.

816
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,410
Don't beat her!

817
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,370
Mr. Yu, don't worry. He won't do that.

818
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,760
What are you all doing?

819
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,570
Huh?

820
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,410
Ling Rui.

821
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,130
Why did you drag me out?

822
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,050
I'm not done talking.

823
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,770
They just taunted you like that.

824
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,610
How could we let them

825
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,170
finish this meal in peace?

826
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,850
Those kinds of snobs

827
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,610
need to be defeated by our strength.

828
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,010
Why are you so angry?

829
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,650
Because...

830
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,370
Because those people

831
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,850
are a bunch of losers,

832
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,770
they're nasty,

833
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,450
and nobody would tolerate them.

834
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,640
Okay, even though I know

835
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,130
I'm still menacing

836
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,850
even when

837
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,730
I'm not wearing my heels.

838
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,130
But, my biggest regret today

839
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:08,770
is that

840
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,610
I didn't wear

841
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,010
my 11-centimeter heels here.

842
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,730
Or else when I saw that stinky man

843
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,650
just now,

844
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,490
I could do this.

845
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,770
And I could look at him this way.

846
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,490
What are you laughing at?

847
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,760
What's so funny?

848
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,570
At times like this,

849
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,440
should I just kiss him?

850
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,170
Someone else is around.

851
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,770
Well, that's fine.

852
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,490
Should I kiss him?

853
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,280
Do it.

854
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,810
I'm not mad.

855
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,010
So,

856
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,570
don't be mad.

857
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:48,970
I...

858
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,010
You're not mad?

859
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,530
Then why did you just

860
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,890
do that

861
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,160
and that?

862
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,360
Because they were right.

863
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,290
When I was in school,

864
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,850
my family was really poor,

865
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,810
and we took a lot of help from others.

866
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,930
Well, they couldn't say that
about you anyway.

867
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,970
These things

868
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,800
are part of my life.

869
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,850
I'm not trying to hide it.

870
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,570
As for

871
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,730
what they said about you,

872
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,410
that's true too.

873
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,090
You're really awesome.

874
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,690
I don't have your mild temper.

875
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,330
He has such a mild temper,

876
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,050
so he should be done

877
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,730
being mad at me about last time, right?

878
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,970
It was different last time.

879
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,690
Why does he know what I'm thinking?

880
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,370
That's annoying.

881
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,970
Fangning.

882
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,730
What's up?

883
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,010
Can I just

884
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,250
ask you a favor?

885
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:09,710
[Bath]

886
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,540
[Sanitary napkin]

887
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,370
Is he a freak?

888
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,450
Cut it out.

889
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,000
He looks funny.

890
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,810
Let's go.

891
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,530
Go?

892
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,410
You are back to your place,

893
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,410
and I go back to mine again?

894
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,810
What's up?

895
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,450
I'm feeling a little uncomfortable.

896
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,930
Every time I have my period,

897
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,490
I don't feel so good.

898
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,810
I need someone to take care of me.

899
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,290
Well, I'll send you back
to your family's place.

900
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,970
What's the point of going back there?

901
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,650
You're not there either.

902
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,010
Besides, who would take care of me

903
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,050
there?

904
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,090
I want to go back to the apartment.

905
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,690
Alright, I'll send you back.

906
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,490
Take a seat.

907
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,890
You know, because of the wedding,

908
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,650
I've been a little busy,

909
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,250
so I haven't cleaned up this place.

910
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,570
It's not always like this.

911
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,970
You know me.

912
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,320
I'll go get you some warm water.

913
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,410
Just a minute.

914
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,400
It hurts.

915
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,930
It hurts.

916
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,170
Fangning.

917
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,970
Where's your hot-water bottle?

918
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,170
Why would I have

919
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,050
a hot-water bottle?

920
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,810
What do you do when your hurts?

921
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,920
I never...

922
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,970
I just endure it.

923
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,250
I just want to go to my room

924
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,970
and clean up a little bit.

925
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,730
Oh, it hurts.

926
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,370
Are you okay?

927
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,570
I'm fine.

928
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,530
One really can't lie.

929
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,810
Why it hurts all of a sudden?

930
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,210
This really hurts like hell.

931
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,970
Come in.

932
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,450
Fangning.

933
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,130
I got you some warm water.

934
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,930
You'll sleep better after you drink this.

935
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:23,930
Thank you.

936
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,680
Careful, it's hot.

937
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,250
Aren't I supposed to

938
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,170
drink brown sugar water?

939
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,210
Drinking brown sugar water or warm water

940
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,290
doesn't make any difference in

941
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,760
helping with your symptoms.

942
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,010
Place this over your belly.

943
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,250
Thank you.

944
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,170
It hurts so much.

945
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,450
Do you want more warm water?

946
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,570
I don't want to drink anymore.

947
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,890
I want you.

948
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,770
Then, go to sleep.

949
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,010
Sleep?

950
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,250
Well, I mean

951
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,410
you'll sleep on your own.

952
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,370
Alright.

953
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,850
Yeah, of course.

954
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,290
I mean, I'm like this, right?

955
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,410
I have to sleep alone.

956
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,770
Where are you going?

957
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,520
I'm suffering.

958
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,730
Can't you just

959
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,330
stay with me?

960
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,330
Stay, please.

961
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,850
It hurts.

962
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,640
Much better.

963
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,210
Put your feet up.

964
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,090
Don't get cold.

965
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,330
You know what,

966
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,090
I do feel better this way.
