[Episode 16]

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,730
Where are you going?

5
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,480
Where are you going?

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Where am I going?

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,910
I'm going to…

8
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,630
Because the

9
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,070
toilets upstairs are all full.

10
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,950
I want to go to the one on the first floor.

11
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,630
How about you?

12
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,430
You… Where are you going?

13
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,560
I think you are too busy working overtime.

14
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,459
So I want to go out

15
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,310
to buy you

16
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,280
something to eat.

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,630
I'm not hungry.

18
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,710
No need for that.

19
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,830
What are you doing?

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,950
No, I'm not hungry.

21
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,190
I won't eat, I won't eat.

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,870
Well…

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,910
I have a lot of things to do.

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,950
If you're hungry,

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,750
just go buy yourself

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,029
something to eat.

27
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,230
Really, you don't have to wait for me.

28
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,110
Go ahead, go.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm leaving now.

30
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,350
What are you doing?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,510
I just want to go on a date with you.

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,000
Ling Rui,

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,680
put your cards on the table.

34
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,029
Are you trying to

35
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,029
use dating as an excuse?

36
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,080
Let me tell you.

37
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,190
I am

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,070
very clever.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
I know what you are thinking.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Is there no next meal

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,150
after this one?

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,320
I can eat this meal

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,070
with you.

44
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,670
But I'll never talk with you

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,680
about this matter.

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,390
Don't even think about it.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,630
It's impossible, definitely.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,520
Really?

49
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,640
Are you not going to date me?

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,350
No.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,990
Date?

52
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,200
Okay.

53
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,400
Listen,

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,150
I am a person that

55
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,230
will take things seriously.

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,160
You can't

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,830
eat your words,

58
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,670
you know?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Lu Fangning,

60
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,110
previously,

61
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,950
I've been denying your feelings.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,440
It was not because I'm apathetic.

63
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,950
Indeed, I dared not admit it before this.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,110
Because for me,

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,520
order

66
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,990
is a very important thing.

67
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,560
You can think of it like this.

68
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,150
A surgeon who loses his order

69
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,270
is like a person who loses his reason.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,920
The order between us

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,030
has always been the opposite.

72
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,350
This has always confused me.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,110
But your true intentions,

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,120
I received it all.

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,320
Are you willing to…

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,990
I…

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,789
I do.

78
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,350
Are you willing to,

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
you and me,

80
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,190
start our relationship from our marriage?

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,310
I…

82
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,440
We…

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,470
You and me…

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,109
Well…

85
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,960
Are you willing to

86
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,430
starting our relationship with me from our marriage?

87
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,990
Ling Rui,

88
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,030
I do.

89
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,600
Why do I feel like crying?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
So embarrassing.

91
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,950
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,040
I've seen you when you were

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
even more embarrassed.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,300
[Deer Sing]

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,710
It's really quite delicious.

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,710
Why are you there

97
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,950
watching me eat?

98
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,390
Eat together.

99
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Okay, okay.

100
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,910
Take it yourself.

101
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,510
That's why you asked me out

102
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,590
so many times?

103
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,270
Just to eat together?

104
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,830
Of course.

105
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,470
What the heck.

106
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,920
What about the birthday celebration?

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,310
And your investment?

108
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,990
Then, you said things that I didn't understand.

109
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,200
You made me misunderstand you for so long.

110
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,830
In fact,

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,040
the answers to these questions are the same.

112
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,390
Other people,

113
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,070
they fall in love and get married.

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,680
And we,

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
get married first and then fall in love.

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,950
The order is reversed.

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,560
And the case is more complicated.

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,910
So,

119
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,190
I want to make everything

120
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,400
a little easier.

121
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,760
Investment

122
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,280
is to help us

123
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,160
avoid any financial entanglements.

124
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,550
The birthday party was

125
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,359
to thank you for

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
everything you've done for me.

127
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
That is to say,

128
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,030
we're having a new beginning.

129
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,280
Starting with dating.

130
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,510
Going by the normal order,

131
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,920
what should we do next?

132
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,800
We can watch movies.

133
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,120
We've seen it.

134
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,880
Episode seven.

135
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,910
In the mall, midnight.

136
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,960
Then…

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,230
We can go to the amusement park.

138
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,150
-Episode nine.
-Episode nine.

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
Actually, we've done a lot of things.

140
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,080
Hold hands.

141
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Kiss.

142
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,710
You can rewind and watch it.

143
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,590
But for me,

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,350
tonight is indeed our first day.

145
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,360
I just found that

146
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,150
we've done

147
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,430
so many things together.

148
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,920
So then,

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,800
what else can we do?

150
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,990
Ling Rui.

151
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,480
Ling Rui, Ling Rui, Ling Rui.

152
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,320
What's wrong?

153
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,190
Come on, come on.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,030
Sit.

155
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,910
What's the matter?

156
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,240
I know what we can do.

157
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,960
Come on, give me your hand.

158
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,310
We're going to change our profile photos

159
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,720
and contact nicknames.

160
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,470
Change it

161
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,800
to our match each other as couples.

162
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,640
Come on.

163
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,350
Like this.

164
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,430
Why are you taking this?

165
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,150
I want to capture your hands.

166
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,790
Your hands are so pretty.

167
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,070
Besides,

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,710
people who don't know you

169
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,720
won't know whose hand is this.

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
It won't expose you.

171
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,040
Someone who knows you,

172
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
they'll know that

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,400
you are my husband.

174
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,470
I should change your profile photo to

175
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,750
the debt bill.

176
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,920
When I see it,

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,750
I'll think of you right away.

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,160
Nice look.

179
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,710
I'll definitely answer your call immediately after seeing it.

180
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,470
What do you mean?

181
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,270
You mean that

182
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm a tigress?

183
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,720
Let me see.

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,310
Quite pretty.

185
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,160
You look good at any angle.

186
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,120
Done.

187
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,870
I gotta go to bed.

188
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,950
Fangning,

189
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,110
what else do you wanna do?

190
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,760
I just want to say…

191
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,110
Good night.

192
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,590
Good night.

193
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,200
Good night.

194
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,400
Good night.

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,080
Good night.

196
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,400
Good night.

No, you first.

199
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,870
You go first.

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,950

207
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,120
I don't need you anymore.

208
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
Good morning.

209
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,310
Only that?

210
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,350
Nothing else?

211
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,270
Typing…

212
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,830
What will you send me?

213
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,270
If I send this,

214
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,870
will she think it's a little rusty?

215
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,120

I slept very well. How about you?

224
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,910
I had a sweet dream.

225
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,150

227
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280

I have eaten.

256
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,640

263
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,760

264
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,000
it was the first morning

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,800

I have an idea.

269
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,270
The coffee smells good today.

270
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,680

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,910
Just look ahead.

274
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,240

275
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,910
Okay, then keep watching.

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,630

300
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,030
did you forget?

301
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,910
I just forgot to kiss goodbye.

302
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,190
But I kissed you just now.

303
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
Yeah, everyone saw that.

304
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,680
Don't laugh.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,600
In the future,

306
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,510
you can only laugh like that in front of me.

307
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,030
Don't laugh like that in front of others.

308
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,070
Because you were so charming

309
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,350
smiling like this.

310
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,680

I'm afraid you

315
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,760
don't even have to go to work today.

316
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,790

What do you mean?

328
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,710

336
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,510

337
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,280
Really?

338
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,430

339
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,960

369
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,590

388
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,240
Come.

389
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,670
I'll make you

390
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,710
the best dinner in the world.

391
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,350
Instant noodles?

392
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,430
When did you

393
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,200
buy so many again?

394
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:42,910
Well,

395
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,750
last time,

396
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,750
you came to my company to see me.

397
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,360
It doesn't matter.

398
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,390
Which flavor would you like to have?

399
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,520
You pick one and I'll make it for you.

400
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,880
You're the boss.

401
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,760
Then…

402
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,510
This one.

403
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,390
Wait for me.

404
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,390
I'll cook the most delicious

405
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,510
instant noodles in the world for you.

406
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,200
First of all,

407
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,950
take a bowl out.

408
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,350
Then,

409
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,310
put the noodles in.

410
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
Then, the seasoning.

411
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,070
Wait.

412
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,800
I'll boil the water first.

413
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,590
After the water is boiled,

414
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,550
just put it in the pot and it's done.

415
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,550
You make instant noodles like this?

416
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
How else can instant noodles

417
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
be cooked?

418
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,550
Let me do it.

419
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,830
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

420
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,510
When the water comes to a boil,

421
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,880
I'll put the noodles in.

422
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay.

423
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,990
What are you doing with ice?

424
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,910
The instant noodles must be cooked in hot water.

425
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,000
Use hot water.

426
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,910
You just watch.

427
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,120
Hot water.

428
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,990
What are you doing with ice?

429
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,480
You'll see it soon.

430
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,440
♫ exist only for you ♫

431
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,440
Every time

432
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
I used to see you cooking,

433
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,360
I really wanted to hug you like this.

434
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,280
♫ Your arrival in my world ♫

435
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,440
♫ Makes me believe in destiny ♫

436
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,950
♫ I'm moved beyond my expectation ♫

437
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,950
♫ I can't move my gaze from you ♫

438
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,230
♫ I know the future is too uncertain ♫

439
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,320
♫ I can only be sure that you are the only one ♫

440
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,990
♫ I'm not afraid to walk in a sea of ​​people ♫

441
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,270
♫ Because I really love you ♫

442
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,040
♫ My dear, I have three hearts for you ♫

443
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,870
♫ Listen to this carefully, this shall not be done half-heartedly ♫

444
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,280
♫ You must love and give with all your heart ♫

445
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,070
Thank you.

446
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,790
Try it.

447
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,480
Smells good.

448
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,270
Is it good?

449
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,830
Good.

450
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,190
It was made by us two,

451
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,110
so good.

452
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,880
You look good anyway.

453
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,230
There's no need to be like this.

454
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,960
Ling Rui,

455
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,030
something just occurred to me.

456
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,750
Look at it.

457
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,440
Disgusting.

458
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,910
Why would I get that idea?

459
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,070
-Eat noodles.
-Eat.

460
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,200
Wonderful.

461
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,760
So,

462
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,440
this is the first day

463
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,390
of our formal relationship.

464
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,710
We two

465
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,800
just cooked together.

466
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
And we ate

467
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,830
such delicious noodles.

468
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,670
Next,

469
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,150
let's go out for a date.

470
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,720
How's that?

471
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,670
Are you tired after a day's work?

472
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,590
If you're tired,

473
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,630
how about

474
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,400
we just date at home?

475
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
Date at home.

476
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,750
What can we do at home?

477
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,310
Don't think too much.

478
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,990
I didn't think too much.

479
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,710
Let's watch TV.

480
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,910
I'm serious.

481
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,880
Let's watch the variety show.

482
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,310
I haven't seen a variety show for a long time.

483
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,110
How's that?

484
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,280
Okay.

485
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,920
Ling Rui,

486
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,870
I don't want to see it.

487
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,470
Didn't you say you wanted to watch TV?

488
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,600
Why you don't want to see it?

489
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,550
It's good.

490
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,670
But I think

491
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,070
you're more attractive than the TV.

492
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,360
I want to talk to you.

493
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,200
Tell me about

494
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,790
what happened

495
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,990
in the hospital today.

496
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,870
What could happen at the hospital?

497
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,950
Same as usual.

498
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,120
What's the usual situation, then?

499
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,390
In simple terms,

500
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,510
I was very busy.

501
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,240
You worked a day.

502
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,190
You must be tired.

503
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,950
It's a good thing I helped you cooking,

504
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,600
right?

505
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,200
Well, thank you very much.

506
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,440
You're welcome, I should do that.

507
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,750
Well,

508
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,840
work was pretty tiring

509
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,230
and I also have

510
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,710
some annoyance,

511
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,990
but as long as you are here,

512
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,040
the world is splendid for me.

513
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,750
I do have

514
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,720
that kind of ability.

515
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
Actually, I feel the same.

516
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,350
In the past,

517
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
I always felt being alone is good.

518
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
There's nothing bad about it.

519
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,760
Not that much trouble.

520
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,110
But since I had you with me,

521
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,390
I've changed my thought.

522
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,670
You made me

523
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,880
form this bad habit.

524
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,520
So you should be responsible for me.

525
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,790
You're not allowed to dislike me.

526
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,030
Or hate me.

527
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,230
Do you hear me?

528
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,950
I promise you.

529
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,280
What?

530
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,110
That's all?

531
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,150
You're not up to scratch.

532
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,670
It's our first date.

533
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,110
How could you kiss me without passion?

534
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,480
Come on.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,310
Save it for next time.

536
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,670
So mean.

537
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,190
Did he fall asleep?

538
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,560
Are you asleep?

539
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:05,950
Yes.

540
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,920
Good night.

541
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,720
He goes to bed so early.

542
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Tomorrow is the weekend.

543
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,550
Where shall we go on a date?

544
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,160
We've been to the amusement park.

545
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,030
Go to the cinema.

546
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,510
Watch a horror movie.

547
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,440
Give him a chance

548
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,920
to jump into my arms.

549
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm afraid I can't tomorrow.

550
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm having a gathering with my colleagues.

551
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,710
Thank you.

552
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,190
I'll help you wear it.

553
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,230
My husband is so handsome.

554
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,630
Remember to come back early tonight.

555
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,790
I'll miss you.

556
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,510
I'll miss you too, dear.

557
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,680
What did you put on?

558
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,870
I…

559
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
I didn't…

560
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
I love you.

561
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,160
Go.

562
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,150
Then,

563
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,470
I'm leaving.

564
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,910
Bye, take care.

565
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,720
Bye.

566
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,190
This is just like the dramas, right?

567
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,360
On the second day of our relationship,

568
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,070
he leaves me alone at home.

569
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,280
I am so lonely.

570
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,000
Cai Siyu,

571
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,590
Ling Rui is not at home today.

572
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,800
Come and hang out with me.

573
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,150
I'm so sorry.

574
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,899
I am

575
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,980
on a date.

576
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,830
You…

577
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:24,350
Didn't even let me say more.

578
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,550
Who? Fangning?

579
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,550
Yes.

580
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,189
Dr. Ling is not home.

581
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,800
She felt a little lonely.

582
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,720
You two get along well with each other.

583
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,589
But it seems that

584
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:38,419
you haven't known each other that long.

585
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,189
We feel like

586
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,070
old friends at the first meeting.

587
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,720
Let's go.

588
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,320
Dance… You danced well.

589
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,470
No.

590
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,230
I sat for too long in the house.

591
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,720
I just did some exercise.

592
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,630
You… Why did you come back?

593
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,280
I wanted to ask you

594
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,430
if you want to come

595
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,110
to join our gathering?

596
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,750
It doesn't matter if you don't want to go.

597
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
They're all colleagues anyway.

598
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,270
Maybe we'll discuss something about

599
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,040
surgeries or work.

600
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,670
You may not be very interested.

601
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,750
I want to go.

602
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,550
I'll go get changed.

603
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,390
Okay.

604
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,670
Okay.

605
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,760
We're almost there.

606
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,150
Do you dare to go there?

607
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,710
Welcome our perfect couple.

608
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,360
Welcome, welcome.

609
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,670
Your colleagues, aren't they

610
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,480
a little over the top?

611
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,480
So beautiful.

612
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,640
Wherever I go,

613
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,120
I'll bring glory to the place.

614
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,830
Hi.

615
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,510
Hello, Dr. Ling, Fangning.

616
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,080
I brought Fangning with me.

617
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,320
Are you satisfied?

618
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,750
-Fangning.
-That's good.

619
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,590
Hello.

620
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,390
Hello, Fangning.

621
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,200
Hello.

622
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,510
Welcome, welcome.

623
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,720
Welcome, Fangning.

624
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,310
Welcome them.

625
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,000
Welcome.

626
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:23,910
Applause.

627
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,950
As long as you guys

628
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,190
can help me take care of

629
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,270
Ling Rui more.

630
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,910
No big deal.

631
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,710
Professor Luo.

632
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,800
Professor Luo.

633
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,280
Professor Luo.

634
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,120
Finally you come.

635
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,910
Fangning will treat us to delicious food.

636
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,750
Professor Luo,

637
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,640
this is my wife.

638
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,630
Since I graduated from my school,

639
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,630
Professor Luo has taken care of me.

640
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,990
He is my mentor.

641
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,080
Professor Luo, hello.

642
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,120
We've met.

643
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,110
It's rare for Ling Rui to bring his family.

644
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,030
We're not going to talk about academic problems today.

645
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,910
Let's just enjoy our meal.

646
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,590
How's that?

647
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,590
Professor.

648
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,830
How about you

649
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,510
consider the…

650
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,550
Let's go.

651
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,320
Please think it over.

652
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,430
Come on, go, go.

653
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,110
Go.

654
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,950
Why are you pinching me?

655
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,750
Go.

656
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,990
Professor, sit down please.

657
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,030
Okay, sit down, everyone.

658
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,710
Thank you.

659
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,550
Xiaoxuan.

660
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,470
What?

661
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,360
Thank you, thank you.

662
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,310
What would you like to eat, professor?

663
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,230
Up to you. You choose.

664
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,720
Fangning, you choose.

665
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,590
What would you like to eat?

666
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,510
Brother is so handsome.

667
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,590
So handsome.

668
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,990
I dreamed about him last night.

669
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,430
Me too.

670
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,440
You like him?

671
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,590
Yes.

672
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,560
I'll get his signature

673
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,120
for you later.

674
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,240
Really?

675
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,590
Ms. Lu, you're so nice.

676
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,800
Ms. Lu, I want one too.

677
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,430
Thank you.

678
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,240
I'll go back and frame it.

679
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,480
You and this actor

680
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,870
whose skin is whiter

681
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,550
than a woman's.

682
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,120
Are you still in touch with him?

683
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,640
Yes.

684
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,080
Didn't I tell you that last time?

685
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,720
The company will hire him as a spokesman.

686
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,910
Really?

687
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,830
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

688
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,270
Dr. Ling,

689
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,750
you're just jealous.

690
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,670
Jealous of our brother's

691
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,630
milk-like skin.

692
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,440
Last time,

693
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,840
I haven't forgiven you yet.

694
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,390
You said our brother is not famous.

695
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,360
When he comes out,

696
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,710
even the sky changes color, okay?

697
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,960
You're just being jealous.

698
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,160
Being jealous is such a childish thing.

699
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,710
I won't do it.

700
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,240
You won't?

701
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,120
Will you?

702
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,680
Of course I won't.

703
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,960
Em…

704
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,710
What would you like to eat?

705
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,750
You don't drink wine.

706
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,880
Have some juice?

707
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,000
Dr. Ling never drinks juice.

708
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,710
He always

709
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,550
ordered black tea, right?

710
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,470
This one?

711
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,550
Here you are.

712
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,680
-See?
-Thank you.

713
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,750
Dr. Ling,

714
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,390
I'd like a cup of black tea, too.

715
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,760
Thank you.

716
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,390
Okay.

717
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,590
Dr. Ling,

718
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,070
I'd like a cup of black tea, too.

719
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,910
Do it yourself.

720
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,240
Ling Rui's lover, right?

721
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,960
Professor Luo,

722
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
you can call me Fangning.

723
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,630
Fangning,

724
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,470
your birth plan with Ling Rui.

725
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,440
How's it going?

726
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,470
Preparations are underway.

727
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,990
That's good, good.

728
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,990
Fangning.

729
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,280
Ling Rui, the indifferent prince charming of our hospital,

730
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,670
is difficult to take down, right?

731
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
A little bit.

732
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,430
Dr. Ling does

733
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,670
make people feel depressed.

734
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,280
Every time he goes into the operating room,

735
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,630
he'll always tell a joke.

736
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,270
Corny jokes, you know.

737
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,280
But he

738
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,560
tells the same one every time.

739
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,430
And we can't embarrass him.

740
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,470
Am I right?

741
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,790
That's right.

742
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,630
You know what.

743
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,520
We were just

744
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,670
chiming in with him.

745
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,750
Just to give him face.

746
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,190
I'm tired of warning him.

747
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,310
Is that so?

748
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,350
Yeah.

749
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,720
You may ask them.

750
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,560
-Yes.
-Exactly.

751
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,600
Actually, it was funny

752
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
when he told us the first time.

753
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,360
But he kept telling us the same one,

754
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,160
then we're afraid of

755
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,240
embarrassing him.

756
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,390
What joke?

757
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,110
It's not funny.

758
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,280
Let's not talk about it.

759
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,440
Peng Bo, what's the joke?

760
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,790
You'd better let Dr. Ling

761
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,830
tell you himself.

762
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,030
So, next time he will

763
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,110
tell another joke.

764
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,520
Yes, he should tell another one.

765
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,110
It's really not that funny.

766
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,950
When he told that joke

767
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,990
the first time,

768
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,070
I didn't think it's funny.

769
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,150
But he liked it.

770
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,000
I'll go to the restroom.

771
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,070
Professor, I'll go with her.

772
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:13,870
Okay.

773
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,390
I have a joke.

774
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Fangning.

775
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,710
Dr. Ling doesn't drink juice,

776
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,920
only black tea, right?

777
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,960
Yes, yes. What the hell!

778
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,270
Dr. Ling, I'd like to have a glass as well.

779
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,190
Pour me a glass.

780
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,880
Pour her a glass!

781
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,760
You poured for her,

782
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
why didn't get one for me?

783
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,640
The first time Dr. Ling

784
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,350
told that joke,

785
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,190
it was pretty funny.

786
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,400
It was not funny later.

787
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,680
If so, why you're laughing?

788
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,240
Hahaha…

789
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,150
They all were laughing.

790
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,870
Am I the only one

791
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,430
who hasn't heard of this joke?

792
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,440
Why didn't you tell me?

793
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,000
Lu Fangning,

794
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,710
you can't be like this.

795
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,830
You don't look pretty when you're angry.

796
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,640
Have you forgotten what you said

797
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,430
before you came here today?

798
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,350
Be elegant.

799
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,920
Calm down.

800
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,430
Keep smiling.

801
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,750
Calm down.

802
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,030
Beautiful.

803
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,430
Hi,

804
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,360
I am back.

805
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,840
What are you talking about?

806
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,520
Okay.
