this is the purchase record you want.

I'm so sorry that

7
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,610
we made you come yourself.

Morning.

13
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,450
Morning.

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,020
Let me see

15
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,010
if I'm dreaming now.

16
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,810
Dreaming?

17
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,250
You should pinch yourself.

18
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,180
If I pinch myself too hard,

19
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,370
won't you feel bad?

20
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,450

you can do this.

Are you dreaming?

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,650
I want to praise you particularly.

74
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,840
Before I came,

75
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,430
I thought in the first place that

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,350
these sets of clothes

77
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,450
you prepared

78
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,680
weren't quite suitable for me.

79
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,340
But

80
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,650
it turns out that

81
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,490
they're both decent, elegant,

82
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,090
and make me look very friendly.

83
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,730
It's good that you're satisfied with them.

84
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,010
You have to look beautiful.

85
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,930
How have you been during these two days?

86
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,780
It's been so-so.

87
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,900
What do you mean?

88
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,970
What's wrong?

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,370
You look a bit down in the dumps.

90
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,690
You and Simon...

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,650
Because of the recorder?

92
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:53,620
Is it because of the recorder?

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,260
Ms. Lu.

94
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,450
Regarding this matter,

95
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,609
I haven't apologized to you yet.

96
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,530
If it wasn't because of my recorder,

97
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,290
there won't be so many troubles.

98
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,690
Why do you have to apologize to me?

99
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,450
Those are essential facts.

100
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,540
I dare to take responsibility for what I've done.

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,609
It's not a big deal.

102
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,540
Don't be like this anymore.

103
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,460
Show me a happy face.

104
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:11,970
How about

105
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,890
I give you a pay raise afterward?

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,090
And double bonus.

107
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,450
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

108
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,130
Why did you think

109
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,450
that I'm suitable

110
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,410
for that kind of mini skirt for a lady?

111
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,610
You look good in whatever type of costume.

112
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,890
Today's light

113
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,460
will probably make them look good.

114
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,650
Why are your hands so cold?

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,770
Are you nervous?

116
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,930
I've never taken part in this kind of photoshoot before.

117
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,010
It's my first time,

118
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,370
so I'm feeling a bit nervous.

119
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,450
It's actually my first time, too.

120
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,250
But

121
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,290
I have you here,

122
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,859
so I'm not nervous.

123
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,170
Great.

124
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,060

Look at Ms. Lu.

142
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,090
She wasn't like this before.

How about you?

152
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,210
I'll no longer be tired after you've kissed me.

153

So many people here are watching.

154
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,170
I pay for their salary.

155
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,370
It's okay to let them gossip.

156
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,290
Come and kiss.

157
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,650
A hug will do.

158
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,650
It's not exactly what I want.

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,460

Enough said.

163
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,570
Work is not easy for me, too.

164
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,770
I can't stand it anymore.

165
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,130

170

Hello.

171
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,300
Okay.

172
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,130
I got it now.

173
00:09:59,450 --> 00:09:59,970
What happened?

174
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,860
There was a quality inspection.

175
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,570
The products of a brand in LM Deer Sing Store

176
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,170
were found defective.

177
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,530
This time around

178
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,980
is just a routine inspection.

179
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,970
They didn't regard LM Deer Sing Group

180
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,730
as a typical one.

181
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,500
We've already contacted

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,250
the merchant

183
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,090
to see how to deal with it.

184
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,650
Ms. Lu

185
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,530
has been notified.

186
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,050
She'll go directly to the store.

187
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,850
You might bump into her

188
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,490
in the store.

189
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,610
How's the situation?

190
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,930
This is the inspection report at the time of purchase.

192
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,010
for three years.

193
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,090
Product quality

194
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,690
has never been a problem.

195
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,770
The procedures are also very complete.

196
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,100
Before entering the store,

197
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,410
the company had also conducted random inspections,

198
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,210
and no problem was found.

199
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,530
How about Leqi's side?

200
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,530
We've already contacted them.

201
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,570
They said there was no problem with the products.

202
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,810
I guessed they would say so.

203
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,210
We can only know the actual outcome

204
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,850
after checking.

205
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,860
Gao Erfan,

206
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,010
you sorted all the people

207
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,740
who had dealt with

208
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,650
this batch of products before.

209
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,330
There must be a detailed review of all the procedures

210
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,210
to identify

211
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,810
the exact problem.

212
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,610
Also,

213
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,210
we'll announce publicly that

214
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,250
Lu Ming will treat

215
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,690
this matter seriously

216
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,980
and give the public an explanation.

217
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,210
Tonight

218
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,810
might be a bit hard for us.

219
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,010
We need to check

220
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,010
all the products in the store again

221
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,890
to make sure that

222
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,660
there won't be another Leqi.

223
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,130
Yes.

224
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,530
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,450
I've told you that

226
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,530
you don't have to come with me.

227
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,660
I'm in a hurry.

228
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,370
I can't return home

229
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,740
in awhile.

230
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,290
I'm fine.

231
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,540
It's good that you can handle it.

232
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,330
I also have to go back to the hospital first.

233
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,170
Be careful.

234
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,690
Thank you for your hard work, Simon.

235
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:31,970
I'm leaving.

236
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,370
Peng Bo.

237
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,860
Is everything okay in the wards during these few days?

238
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,010
You're back.

239
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,020
Nothing happened.

240
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,480
[To Ling Rui]

241
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,210
Are you exhausted

242
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,010
after going back this time?

243
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,340
When is the express delivery?

244
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,300
This morning. What happened?

245
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,990
[Interview notice]

246
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,490
Your expression...

247
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,170
What is this?

248
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,930
Ling Rui.

249
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,530
You've received it, right?

250
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,130
I heard that this time around,

251
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,570
you should be on the list.

252
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,450
Professor.

253
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,660
Great.

254
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,690
That's great.

255
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,420
This is the notification letter sent

256
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,330
by the Pancreas Institute

257
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,300
in Germany?

258
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,170
My goodness, Ling Rui.

259
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,050
Finally, you're going to succeed.

260
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,770
This fellow...

261
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,780
What kind of expression is this?

262
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,220
This is something to be happy about.

263
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,130
Why didn't you even smile?

264
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,060
Of course I'm happy.

265
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,330
When will you

266
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,130
join the orientation?

267
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,850
They asked me

268
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,490
to attend an interview in Germany in a week.

269
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,820
Why do you need to go for an interview

270
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,770
when you've received the notification letter?

271
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,010
You know nothing.

272
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,930
The person in charge of the project

273
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,450
which Ling Rui will join this time around

274
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,930
will be his mentor in the future.

275
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,170
Of course he needs to visit him.

276
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,650
Don't worry.

277
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,690
It's just part of the procedure.

278
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,890
There won't be any problems.

279
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,170
Besides conducting research normally,

280
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,740
Professor Cliff

281
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,090
is just a simple-minded person.

282
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,130
He's one with a kind personality.

283
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,090
When are you leaving?

284
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,930
Do you need to apply for leave?

285
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,730
I can sign now.

286
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,450
You can go now.

287
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,890
Professor Luo.

288
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,450
It's a week later

289
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,650
for the interview.

290
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,530
He's been waiting for so long.

291
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,250
I hope that he can go right away.

292
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,850
Right now.

293
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,650
Immediately.

294
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,770
Professor.

295
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,140
He has a family.

296
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,330
No matter what,

297
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,330
he needs to inform his family.

298
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,410
Moreover, he'll leave for three years.

299
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,450
How can he leave now?

300
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,970
It'll delay his plan of getting a baby.

301
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,450
Gosh.

302
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,210
Don't bother him

303
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,010
at this time, okay?

304
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,530
This is really a big deal.

305
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:45,930
Hello, it's me.

306
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,370
How's the preparation

307
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,250
for the next action?

308
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,210
Okay.

309
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,170
Always get ready.

310
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,290
Listen to my signal.

311
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,650
Dr. Ling.

312
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,890
Ms. Lu is inside.

313
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,580
You can go in.

314
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,810
Okay, thank you.

315
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,130
Hello, this is the general manager's office.

316
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,410
You're here.

317
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,300
Have you had your meal?

318
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,450
Not yet.

319
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,050
Here's the food delivered to you by me.

320
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,260
Let me answer it.

321
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,970
What's it again?

322
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,610
Ms. Lu.

323
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,770
Two brands

324
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,980
wanted to withdraw from our store.

325
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,690
Hold them up for now.

326
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,290
Ask them to hold their horses.

327
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:44,970
Okay.

328
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,900
What's the situation now?

329
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,690
I can still handle it.

330
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,850
How about you?

331
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,730
You went to work today.

332
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,410
Did any young nurse harass you?

333
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,610
I'm always cold.

334
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,530
I didn't give a smile at all.

335
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,300
Really?

336
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,380
How is it like? Show me.

337
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,650
Your eyes are still smiling.

338
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,420
Change to another look.

339
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,730
That's more like it.

340
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,330
You're so good.

341
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,940
Thank you.

342
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,450
Fangning.

343
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,490
I have something to tell you.

344
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,570
What happened?

345
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,250
Today, I received...

346
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,090
Oh, I'm doomed.

347
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,850
I asked them to go and check the store,

348
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,930
but I forgot to tell them

349
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,260
that the newly entered brands

350
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,810
also need to be checked.

351
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,290
It'll be miserable if there's a mistake again.

352
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,180
I have to go to the store.

353
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,810
Did you just say

354
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,330
that you want to

355
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,250
tell me something?

356
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,010
There's nothing.

357
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,850
You go ahead.

358
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,090
I'll tell you again

359
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,410
when you've done your stuff.

360
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,890
Then I'll make a move now.

361
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,250
Wait for me.

362
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,010
Leave me some.

363
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,529
Wait for me.

364
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm leaving.

365
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,450
Bye-bye!

366
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:22,250
Bye-bye!

367
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,010
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,970
There were even more things to settle when I reached the store.

369
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,730
Why are you still here?

370
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,410
Were you asleep?

371
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,290
I'm really sorry.

372
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,620
I'll still have to be here

373
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,010
and wait for updates from the store.

374
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,970
I can't go back yet.

375
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,850
You go back first.

376
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,650
You still have to go to work

377
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,490
in the hospital tomorrow.

378
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,490
How can you work without energy?

379
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,050
Listen to me. Hurry up and go back now.

380
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,090
Okay then.

381
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,490

Rest assured.

384
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:45,970
Go now.

385
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,850
Come back early then.

386
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,460
I'll leave first.

387
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,940

You're back.

You worked all night again.

394
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,060
What can I say?

395
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,850
I've made breakfast, do you want some?

396
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,250
Wah.

I'm sorry.

401

I said yesterday

402
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,210
that I'd be back soon.

403
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,250
It's fine.

Well...

409
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,850
It's been alleviated temporarily.

410
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,170
It should be fine later on.

411

which were revealed swiftly,

482
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,330
causing the public

483
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,370
to have a bad impression on LM Deer Sing.

Moreover, many brands

485
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,850
have terminated their cooperation with LM Deer Sing Group one after another now.

the shareholders

489
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,770

490
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,420
This matter was exposed too quickly

491
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,490
with too many coincidences.

492
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,330
I've asked someone to look into it,

493
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,290
but it takes time.

494
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,570
The most important thing now

495
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,900
is to prevent the news from spreading like wildfire.

496
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,450
I'll personally go to Leqi

497
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,450
and Hanping's factories.

498
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,330
It's indeed better

499
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,290
for the manufacturers to give an explanation.

500
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,450
I'll go with you then.

501
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,130

502
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,900

504
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,810
Is sister-in-law okay?

505
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,410
When I took the subway this morning,

506
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,770
I heard from the news,

507
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,330
they were all talking

508
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,330
about her company's issue.

509
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,050
It's a big mess.

510
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:19,810
Yes.

511
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,900
Go away.

512
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,770
There's nothing to gossip about. Go away.

513
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,530
I'm concerned about the director now.

514
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,540
Well,

515
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,490
you go over there.

516
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,770
I have something to talk to him about.

517
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,010
Just go over there.

518
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,170
Regarding your studies in Germany,

519
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,090
you haven't told her, right?

520
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,370
You said an affirmative sentence.

521
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,810
Based on what I understand about you,

522
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,050
you'll never say at this time.

523
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,010
Bro, can you say something?

524
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,850
You've already said an affirmative sentence.

525
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,730
What do you want me to answer?

526
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,490
You always bottle things up.

527
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,810
When are you going to tell her?

528
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,690
The interview will start in two days.

529
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,410
Okay.

530
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,530
What are you thinking?

531
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,850
Have you booked the flight ticket?

532
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,530
Have you got in touch with Germany's side?

533
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,940
Yes, this interview is only part of a procedure.

534
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,620
But you don't even go through the procedure.

535
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,300
Doesn't that mean you're giving up?

536
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,810
I think Lu Fangning is quite capable.

537
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,810
It's no use for you to worry here.

538
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,700
Since you have the time,

539
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,340
you should think

540
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,010
about your future.

541
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,900
Oh my goodness, bro!

542
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,450
I...

543
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,620
I'm so worried about you.

544
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,460
Just eat,

545
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,210

[Leqi]

547
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,650
Ms. Lu,

548
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,810
I really don't know

549
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,530
where the problem lies.

550
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,930
We've always kept our feet on the ground

551
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,610
while doing our jobs.

552
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:01,940
We've also received

553
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,010
a lot of returned orders now.

554
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,690
It's also not a small loss.

555
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,370
Now is not the time to talk about this.

556
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,930
The most important thing is to figure out the solution.

557
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,170
What say you?

558
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,690
I have a solution here.

559
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,850
That's to recall all the products

560
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,660
in the same batch.

561
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,450
As long as the customers have inquiries,

562
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,370
we'll refund them,

563
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,180
no matter if they think

564
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,450
the product is defective or not.

565
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,930
I've allocated all my funds

566
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,180
for the expansion of the factory

567
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,730
and the import of new equipment.

568
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,770
Aren't you causing difficulty for me now?

569
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,410
That's the only solution for now

570
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,010
which can regain

571
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,530
the customers' trust towards us in their minds.

572
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,050
It's worth it in the long run.

573
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,210
For Hanping's side,

574
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,050
I'll also go

575
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,020
and discuss it with them.

576
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,930
Ms. Lu,

577
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,010
I know that your solution

578
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,090
is also good for us.

579
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,130
But

580
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,370
Hanping is the same as us.

581
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,930
We're all emerging companies.

582
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,370
If you want us to utilize the cash flow

583
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,730
for the refunds,

584
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,570
my whole factory's operations

585
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,970
can only be discontinued.

586
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:45,860
Look.

587
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,050
I'm raising so many people.

588
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,330
If we stop production,

589
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,370
my business

590
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,500
will be considered going bankrupt.

591
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,450
Ling Rui.

592
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,780
I got you.

593
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,850
What brought you over?

594
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,010
How did you know that I'm here?

595
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,290
I went to the company and couldn't find you.

596
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,810
I guessed you would be here.

597
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,730
Is it difficult to solve

598
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,410
LM Deer Sing Group's crisis?

599
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,650
In fact, it's not impossible to solve it.

600
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,540
It should be all right for Lu Ming

601
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,010
to get through this crisis.

602
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,340
It's just that those two factories

603
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,570
may no longer

604
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,330
be revived.

605
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,850
Do you think

606
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,330
if I should lend them a helping hand?

607
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,450
If you happen to save them,

608
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,730
will you encounter any difficulty?

609
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,770
Those two factories

610
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,290
hire hundreds of employees.

611
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,010
I thought

612
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:02,940
that you surely would ask me

613
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,130
to help them.

614
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,890
I'm not that holy.

615
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,860
The Savior needs to save himself first.

616
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:10,970
Moreover,

617
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,690
LM Deer Sing Group's survival

618
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,700
is also related to many people's lives.

619
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,610
You're running a business.

620
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,930
The concepts of conscience,

621
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,050
original intention,

622
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,850
and compassion

623
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,530
can only be practiced

624
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,250
with the premise that the company can survive.

625
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,130
Besides,

626
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,610
if you have a way to protect yourself,

627
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,450
you don't need to think about

628
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,290
the temporary gains nor losses.

629
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,770
After all,

630
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,450
it'd be a good deed

631
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,700
if you can help others.

632
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,130
Okay.

633
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,160
[Yu Shiyi, waiting for the call to be answered]

634
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,180
Hello, ex-boyfriend.

635
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,770
Why did you suddenly think of contacting me?

636
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,620
I have something to ask for your help with.

637
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,010
I knew it.

638
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,780
If you don't have

639
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,530
something serious,

640
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,890
you won't contact me.

641
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,130
But if I remember correctly,

642
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,570
shouldn't you appear

643
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,170
at the institute six days later?

644
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,250
Are you asking me

645
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,970
to help you pack your luggage

646
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,170
by looking for me at this hour?

647
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,730
Can you please contact

648
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,450
Professor Cliff for me?

649
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,420
I want to change the interview time,

650
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,170
or we can

651
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,250
schedule a video call first.

652
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,610
I have something to handle here for now.

653
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,020
I mightn't be able to go there right away.

654
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,140
You're really troublesome.

655
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,690
But I can't guarantee

656
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,570
that I'll succeed.

657
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,450
You know Germans.

658
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,770
Let me try first.

659
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,410
Thank you.

660
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,730
Cut the

661
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,650
civilities out.

662
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,570
I'm hanging up.

663
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,090
Bye-bye.

664
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,300
[LM Deer Sing Group]

665
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,570
You ask me to come over.

666
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,660
Is there any solution?

667
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm thinking to let LM Deer Sing Group take

668
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,770
all the responsibilities for now.

669
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,090
What do you mean?

670
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,010
Before the issue

671
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,380
gets worse,

672
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,370
I want LM Deer Sing Group

673
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,930
to bear all the losses in advance.

674
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,450
To meet all the needs of customers,

675
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,290
including returns, refunds, and even compensation.

676
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,730
For the products' environmental issues,

677
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,690
the direct responsible parties

678
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,210
are their brand manufacturers.

679
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,770
After all,

680
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,650
LM Deer Sing Store is just

681
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,610
a sales platform for these brands.

682
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,410
We shouldn't take all the responsibilities.

683
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,850
Of course I know.

684
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,010
I'll also hold those

685
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,100
manufacturers accountable for these.

686
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,210
But the point

687
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,130
is they totally don't have

688
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,690
the ability

689
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,370
to afford all the compensation.

690
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,010
There's only a dead end for them.

691
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,020
Moreover, the key to the problem

692
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,410
is to appease public opinion

693
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,850
by meeting customers' needs.

694
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,380
What I worry about is that if we do so,

695
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,330
we'll need to contribute a lot of funds.

696
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,650
That's too risky.

697
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,050
Is there any better way?

698
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,810
Let's issue a statement publicly

699
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,810
that we'll strictly check for the parties responsible for these.

700
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,850
As long as we dare to face the problem,

701
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,770
LM Deer Sing Group's reputation will soon be rebuilt.

702
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,730
How long is required?

703
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,210
It's feasible.

704
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,050
But you need enough

705
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,210
funds to support the effort.

706
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,970
Also, it's not that

707
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,570
you can execute it

708
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,890
after Simon and I

709
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,650
have agreed.

710
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,250
What about the board?

711
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,130
Have you thought about it?

712
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,490
Of course I know that

713
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,450
there's a huge risk for this.

714
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,090
But LM Deer Sing Group's credibility

715
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,460
must be rebuilt immediately.

716
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,090
I've asked Gao Erfan to contact

717
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,980
all the investors

718
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,220
who approached us before.

719
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,610
I'll also filter out those investors

720
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,410
who are competent enough

721
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,970
and are willing to help us as soon as possible.

722
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,970
I believe that we'll have a bargaining chip

723
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,970
in front of the board.

724
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,650
For my side,

725
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,650
there're also a few trustworthy

726
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,490
investors who are close with me.

727
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,210
I can convince them.

728
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:46,970
Okay.

729
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,650
I'll go and ask

730
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,490
those investors

731
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,650
to see if they're still interested.

732
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,530
According to the current

733
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,330
situation of our store,

734
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,130
we must filter out

735
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,060
the most suitable

736
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,210
investor within two days.

737
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,250
Little bear,

738
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,130
thank you for eating with me.

739
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,540
Come on.

740
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,210
I toast you.

741
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,370
Bottoms up.

742
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,050
Boss must be so worried

743
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,730
that her hair is even falling out now.

744
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,930
By thinking so,

745
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,170
we ordinary people

746
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,370
still live a more comfortable life.

747
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,680
Come on.

748
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,460
Let's clink first.

749
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,250
Okay.

750
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,050
In fact, I asked you out today

751
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,010
is because our...

752
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,020
Look at you.

753
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,129
You talk about the work from the beginning

754
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:21,970
when you invited me out for a meal?

755
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,649
Fine. Then

756
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,169
I toast you again.

757
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,730
I get drunk easily.

758
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,850
You may drink more.

759
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,129
Okay, I'll drink it.

760
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,689
Who is this woman?

761
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,370
Both of them are single.

762
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,330
What does it mean that they're eating together at night?

763
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,660
It's a difficult period of time for LM Deer Sing Group now.

764
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,290
I can't believe that he still has time

765
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,570
to dine with a woman.

766
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,169
Yiyao.

767
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:56,760
It's actually okay that LM Deer Sing Group can't hold on,

768
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:58,689
or

769
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:01,280
you can come to my company.

770
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,220
Although your last name is Lu,

771
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,540
this world shows us that

772
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,130
those long united shall be divided.

773
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,690
Why do you care so much?

774
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,170
How come you still touch him?

775
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,100
Lu Yiyao.

776
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,090
Don't you stay away from strangers?

777
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,570
Why did you change your mind now?

778
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,610
Come on.

779
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,090
Have a drink.

780
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,650
Okay.

781
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,290
Then I represent LM Deer Sing Group

782
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,330
to toast you again.

783
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,410
Cai...

784
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,210
Who is this?

785
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,940
This is LM Deer Sing Group's employee,

786
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,130
Miss Cai Siyu.

787
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,850
This is Ms. Xu.

788
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,810
We're here

789
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,450
to talk about the investment in LM Deer Sing Group.

790
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,660
Ms. Xu.

791
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,490
Well...

792
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,170
This is our first time meeting,

793
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,610
I'll toast you first.

794
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,850
Well.

795
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,610
Ms. Xu,

796
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,250
I'm sorry that

797
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,610
I was reckless just now.

798
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,770
I'll punish myself for a shot.

799
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,210
Well,

800
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,300
Director Lu

801
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,980
usually doesn't drink a lot.

802
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,090
I'm still quite okay with it.

803
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,610
I'll toast you on behalf of Director Lu.

804
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,570
What are you doing?

805
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,100
Ms. Xu,

806
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,970
I'm also an employee of LM Deer Sing Group.

807
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,610
LM Deer Sing Group has encountered such a huge crisis,

808
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,450
I...

809
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,330
On behalf of my colleagues,

810
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,660
I toast you,

811
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,570
hoping that you

812
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,490
can help us.

813
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,770
That's enough.

814
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,140
It's okay, Director Lu.

815
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,020
I'm still okay.

816
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,210
I'll treat you

817
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,050
well today.

818
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,330
If this is the case...

819
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,740
Waiter,

820
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,890
get us ten more bottles.

821
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,610
That's enough.

822
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,650
Let me drink it.

823
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,170
Director Lu, you can't drink too much.

824
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,330
I'll drink it.

825
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,820
Don't drink anymore, okay?

826
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,250
I'll drink it.

827
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,010
I'll drink it.

828
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,220
That's enough, don't drink anymore.

829
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,370
I'll drink it.

830
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,490
I'm still okay.

831
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,890
Don't drink it.

832
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,770
Give it to me.

833
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,940
Don't drink anymore.

834
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,420
That's enough.

835
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,130
She's gone.

836
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,770
Why did you come here again?

837
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,050
You were creating chaos here.

838
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,530
What are you talking about?

839
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,050
I did it for you.

840
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,890
If I didn't see you,

841
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,570
you may be with that Ms. Xu...

842
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,740
Right?

843
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,620
You scumbag don't appreciate it.

844
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,490
I just wanted to help you.

845
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,170
I was just here to talk about...

846
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,690
Just to have a talk?

847
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,210
Okay, if you want to have a talk, then drink it.

848
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,300
Drink it.

849
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,890
Okay, I'll drink it.

850
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,650
Let's see what will happen if I don't help you. Drink it.

851
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,130
Aren't you capable of drinking a lot?

852
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,930
Then you should drink it, too.

853
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,380
Okay, I'll drink it.

854
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,570
Come on.

855
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,410
Don't stop. Continue.

856
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:03,250
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

857
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:13,060
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

858
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:22,570
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

859
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,700
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

860
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,530
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

861
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,130
♫ I like you ♫

862
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,980
♫ Only you ♫

863
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,770
♫ You're my one and only ♫

864
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,980
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

865
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,050
Why are you swaying?

866
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,130
I drank too much.

867
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,090
We...

868
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,890
Where are we going?

869
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,220
Go to bed.

870
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,340
Go to bed?

871
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,490
Where to sleep?

872
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,570
Go there.

873
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,500
Go there to sleep.

874
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,260
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo, and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

875
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,620
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

876
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:46,090
♫ We can lie on the beach and count the stars ♫
