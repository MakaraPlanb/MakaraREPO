[Episode 29]

4
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,730
I...

5
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,980
I want to tell you something.

6
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,700
What's up?

7
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,770
Actually...

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,580
Actually...

9
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,260
You know, six years ago,

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,820
I went to talk to Lu Fangning.

11
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,690
And I told her that

12
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,340
you received an invitation

13
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,220
from the German Institute.

14
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,170
I...

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,890
I was trying to get her to talk you into going.

16
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,300
But who knew that

17
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,540
she would divorce you straightaway.

18
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,860
And I certainly didn't expect her

19
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,780
to have a baby

20
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,300
without telling us.

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,010
Mom.

22
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,850
Calm down.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,660
It's not your fault.

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,529
I've been holding it in

25
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:29,890
all this time.

26
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,970
I finally got the chance

27
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,410
to say it out.

28
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,970
It's okay. It's all over now.

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,860
-My heart hurts.
-Pretty Granny.

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,410
Are you not feeling well?

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,330
Granny's heart is aching.

32
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,290
Let me pat it for you, pretty Granny.

33
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,300
My baby.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,330
Such a good boy.

35
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,690
My head hurts.

36
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,210
It hurts so much.

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,650
Pretty Granny,

38
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,060
let me massage it for you.

39
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,740
Lu Youyou, my arm hurts.

40
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,820
Here.

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,500
-My shoulder hurts.
-Pretty Sis.

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,020
Let me massage it for you.

43
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,290
I'll be your doctor,

44
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,700
just like Dad.

45
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,500
Youyou.

46
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,290
Did you wash your hands?

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,860
Shut up.

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,820
It's been so long.

49
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,779
There's not even a phone call.

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,730
What in the world is going on?

51
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,980
Is he coming back or not?

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,810
Did Youyou betray me?

53
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,860
That's impossible.

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,250
What kind of grown-ups can handle those three moves?

55
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,580
Youyou finally got sent back.

56
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,620
Youyou!

57
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,820
Youyou!

58
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,780
-Hello.
-Hi.

59
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,410
What are you two doing here?

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,090
Is this because

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,730
you realized that you were being a bit harsh last time,

62
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,690
so you came here

63
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,020
to apologize?

64
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,010
We're all adults.

65
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,020
We should take responsibility for our words.

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,300
That's enough. Step aside.

67
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,380
Youyou.

68
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,410
Youyou.

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,620
Little Mommy is here to visit you.

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Where are you?

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,860
Look

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,610
what I brought you.

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,860
All the finest toys.

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,810
Where are you?

75
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,780
I adore you so much.

76
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,859
Youyou.

77
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,730
Did you hear that

78
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,410
she just called herself 'little mommy'?

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,380
Yeah.

80
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,420
Hasn't she always

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,450
like to compete with you?

82
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:49,380
This time, she's okay

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
with being just the little mom.

84
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,370
What more could you ask?

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,450
My son would never want

86
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,490
a silly mom like her.

87
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,260
How ridiculous.

88
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,850
What about you?

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,210
You must be here to apologize.

90
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,460
Youyou.

91
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,570
Is Youyou here, Pingping?

92
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,180
-No.
-No?

93
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,660
I wanted to share

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,700
a short story with him.

95
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,930
You...

96
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,610
So you're here to see my son too?

97
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,050
I wrote a new book.

98
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,090
There's a kid in the story

99
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,500
who is about Youyou's age.

100
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,690
I want to use him as a model.

101
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,210
Alright.

102
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,940
You two can stop looking.

103
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,530
Lu Youyou isn't here.

104
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,660
He's at his dad's home.

105
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,540
His biological dad.

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,770
You two brought

107
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,700
so much stuff.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,010
It must be hard to carry them around.

109
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,820
Just leave them here.

110
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
As for your new story,

111
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,610
if you're having any problems with it,

112
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,650
you can just talk to me.

113
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,290
I do have

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,700
some experience in this area.

115
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,020
What a pity that Youyou is not here.

116
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,290
What a pity.

117
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,740
I canceled a schedule for nothing.

118
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,690
I have yet to finish writing and conceiving

119
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,530
my new story.

120
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,700
I'll tell you about it next time.

121
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,090
Oh, yeah. I'll give these presents

122
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,530
to Youyou in person next time.

123
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,660
Yup. See you next time.

124
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,690
How can you two be like this?

125
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,700
How can you only care about the kid

126
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,780
but not the mom?

127
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,370
So all these that you've brought,

128
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,850
none of them is for me?

129
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,010
I'll tell you what.

130
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,340
Since you two

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,020
want to see Youyou so badly,

132
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,930
I have an idea.

133
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,410
I can take you to him.

134
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,180
I know the address.

135
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,130
Did you drive here?

136
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,970
I'll drive.

137
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,900
I drive fast.

138
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,220
You guys are my good friends.

139
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,410
If you want to meet Youyou,

140
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm sure Ling Rui wouldn't mind.

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,090
Isn't there...

142
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,570
Something wrong.

143
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,860
What's wrong with me?

144
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,010
What's wrong with

145
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,650
helping my friends to fulfill their dreams?

146
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,260
Was Lu Fangning

147
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,540
ever so helpful?

148
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,690
I don't think so.

149
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,060
She was never like this.

150
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,730
And she said that

151
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,740
she is our friend.

152
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
It's even more wrong

153
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,780
for her to say that you're her friend.

154
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,930
-Yeah!
-What's going on?

155
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,140
She'd never possibly call me her friend.

156
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,290
Oh my. Lu Fangning.

157
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,850
Are you out of your mind?

158
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,820
That's enough.

159
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,540
You guys can cut it out.

160
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,850
I'm still here.

161
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,020
Well...

162
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,609
Actually...

163
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,020
I want to see Youyou too.

164
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,090
Fighting for custody?

165
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,650
How could Dr. Ling be like this?

166
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,970
I'll tell you what.

167
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm going to transfer you some money.

168
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,370
No, that wouldn't be enough.

169
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,660
I'll transfer you a large sum of money

170
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,410
so you can hire the best lawyers.

171
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,660
Plus, we can utilize

172
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,140
my influence in the media

173
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,820
to gain some compassion points

174
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,170
for a single mother like you.

175
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,610
Alright, you need to stay out of this.

176
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,420
What's wrong with Dr. Ling doing this?

177
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,100
He was kept in the dark for six years.

178
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,090
True.

179
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,850
Then I'll send Dr. Ling some money too.

180
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,170
Just a little bit

181
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,580
less than yours.

182
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,460
How is that?

183
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,340
He didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,050
I'm the one who's wrong.

185
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,740
If we can't do this the conventional way,

186
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,970
we can try some tricks instead.

187
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,460
What do you mean by that?

188
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,050
Seduction.

189
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:56,940
Is it different

190
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,090
from what I did before?

191
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,660
Of course, it's different.

192
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,780
You used to do it for love.

193
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,460
This time, it's for...

194
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,890
Dr. Ling

195
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,890
just wants a baby.

196
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,410
Just give him one.

197
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,380
Problem solved.

198
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,210
You get one, he gets one.

199
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,940
You each have one. How fair is that.

200
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,570
Seduction.

201
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,940
Why are you two acting like this?

202
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,460
Is one not enough?

203
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,980
Then, two.

204
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,370
Or three?

205
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,530
Four should be enough.

206
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,210
It's exhausting to have babies.

207
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,020
I feel bad for you.

208
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,020
Thank you.

209
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,850
Is quantity the problem here?

210
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,450
If the quantity is not the problem, what is?

211
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,210
If you have an idea, say it.

212
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,489
With your brain,

213
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,060
anyone can think of something like that.

214
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,210
So, what do you have in mind?

215
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,420
Still, seduction.

216
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,900
Then what's the difference?

217
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,980
Isn't that what she just said?

218
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,260
Well, it's kind of a cliche.

219
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,570
The way to a man's heart

220
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,690
is through his body.

221
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,420
Isn't that right?

222
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,370
Yup.

223
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,610
Yes.

224
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,180
I don't think

225
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
this is how the saying goes.

226
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,810
The stomach is part of the human body.

227
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,020
-Exactly.
-Look at yourself.

228
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,820
Trade yourself

229
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,140
in return for Dr. Ling's forgiveness.

230
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
It's a small price to pay.

231
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,660
Plus, you'll be getting two for the price of one.

232
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,850
What a great bargain!

233
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,810
You're right!

234
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,420
It's a great bargain!

235
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,090
Here.

236
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,500
Cheers!

237
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,290
What's with that reaction?

238
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,180
I think someone's just being a chicken.

239
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,050
Yeah.

240
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,260
Scared.

241
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,650
-Chickened out.
-Exactly.

242
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,020
She used to have thousands of tricks

243
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,210
up her sleeve.

244
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,980
I know, right?

245
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,970
How is she such a coward now?

246
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,850
Who says I'm a coward?

247
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,660
Who says I'm scared?

248
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,150
-So, when do you plan to go?
-So, when do you plan to go?

249
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,900
Right now!

250
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,180
Or... Tomorrow.

251
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,620
It's getting a little late out there.

252
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,900
I'll go tomorrow.

253
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,420
I'll definitely go tomorrow. Sit down.

254
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,180
Let me see

255
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,260
what your mom packed for you?

256
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,490
Why did your mom

257
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,850
pack two towels?

258
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,770
Did she tell you

259
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,460
how to use them?

260
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,250
Yes.

261
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,570
The yellow one is for my face

262
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,850
and the blue one is for the shower.

263
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,020
Put it back where it was.

264
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,210
-Put it back.
-Okay. Wait a second.

265
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,770
What?

266
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,730
We're going to have to wash your face with this one later.

267
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,540
Oh, okay. Then, take it.

268
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,210
Take it.

269
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,940
What are you doing?

270
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,620
I'm holding a towel.

271
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,970
Give it to Daddy.

272
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:51,890
Here.

273
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,810
-Daddy.
-What's wrong?

274
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,210
You're so great.

275
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,130
You haven't seen me for five years

276
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,370
and you're still considering

277
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,450
Mommy's feelings.

278
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
Are you still worried that

279
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,770
I might miss Mommy?

280
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,580
No wonder Mommy always says that

281
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,300
my daddy is an angel.

282
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,090
But I'm a good kid.

283
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,130
I'll be good and

284
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,300
stay with Daddy.

285
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,890
I'm not going to miss Mommy.

286
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,170
Youyou, you're so sweet.

287
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,620
Daddy needs to take this.

288
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,460
Who's that?

289
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,730
Is Mommy missing me?

290
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,970
Maybe not.

291
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,580
Are you answering it?

292
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,090
Yes.

293
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,780
Hello.

294
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,730
Yes.

295
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,340
Tomorrow?

296
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,730
What is it?

297
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,850
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,250
Alright, I get it.

299
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,570
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

300
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,700
Yeah.

301
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,740
Okay, bye.

302
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,340
-Youyou.
-What's up?

303
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,060
Daddy promised you that

304
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,810
I'm going to take you out

305
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,380
to play tomorrow, right?

306
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,730
Yeah. Why?

307
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,770
What's the matter?

308
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,220
Daddy might have to

309
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,500
apologize to you now.

310
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,780
What is it?

311
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,530
Is there anything wrong?

312
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,900
Because tomorrow,

313
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,340
Daddy has to go to the hospital.

314
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,820
There's an emergency

315
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,930
that Daddy has to take care of.

316
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,930
So, Daddy probably can't keep my promise.

317
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,210
Hospital?

318
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,580
I've got a new idea.

319
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,220
Daddy.

320
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,700
Can you take me with you?

321
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,770
You want to go to the hospital too?

322
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,460
Yeah.

323
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,380
I want to see

324
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,460
where Daddy works.

325
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,890
I'm a little doctor, after all.

326
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,540
You're a little doctor too?

327
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,850
Yeah. Did you forget?

328
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,660
I treated my grannies.

329
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,850
You treated your grannies?

330
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,730
Daddy almost forgot.

331
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,210
Alright.

332
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,890
Daddy will take you

333
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,820
to the hospital tomorrow.

334
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,900
Yay!

335
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,260
Let's go wash my face.

336
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,140
You want to wash your face?

337
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,930
Yes.

338
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,970
-Go, go, go.
-Wash your face.

339
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,500
Wash your face.

340
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,890
Wash your face.

341
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,090
So cute.

342
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,610
So handsome.

343
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,620
So lovely.

344
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,180
Have you guys watched enough?

345
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,900
He's so cute.

346
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,770
Later,

347
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,860
I need to discuss a case with the other departments.

348
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,850
Youyou will be here during that time.

349
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,380
Please take care of him for me.

350
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,570
Don't worry, Director.

351
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,900
We will definitely take good care of

352
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,050
your excellent achievement.

353
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,940
That's not necessary.

354
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,180
You be careful yourselves.

355
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,010
Be careful of what?

356
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,740
Baby.

357
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,820
Daddy

358
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,770
is going to be busy with work for a while.

359
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,900
You can stay here,

360
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,740
but do not disturb

361
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,020
these aunties and uncles,

362
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,730
okay?

363
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,180
Okay, Daddy.

364
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,290
High five.

365
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,010
One more time.

366
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,450
I'll get going.

367
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,660
My heart is melting.

368
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,610
Thanks.

369
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,100
This little face.

370
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,570
Don't scare him.

371
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,730
Little fingers.

372
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,820
Hey, there.

373
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,530
My last name is Yang.

374
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,980
You can call me Dr. Yang, okay?

375
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,330
Hi, Dr. Yang.

376
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,450
Good boy.

377
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,250
Is that my godson?

378
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,810
Get up, get up.

379
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,410
Let me have a look.

380
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,650
Excuse me, excuse me.

381
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,490
Get your hands off.

382
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,620
You know who I am, right?

383
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,690
No.

384
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,540
I finally meet you.

385
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,730
I'm your godfather.

386
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,540
I already have a godfather.

387
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,820
Listen to me.

388
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,530
The other godfathers

389
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,700
will have to come after me.

390
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,850
Your dad and I

391
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,130
grew up together.

392
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,060
And we've been

393
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,970
best friends for over a decade.

394
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:27,940
In the hospital,

395
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,290
we're also the best partners

396
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,500
and the best rivals.

397
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,050
As of today,

398
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm your curly-haired godfather.

399
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,450
Come here.

400
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,970
Yeah.

401
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,460
Closer.

402
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,920
Yeah.

403
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,260
It feels so good.

404
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,170
No wonder Daddy

405
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,980
likes to touch Mommy's head.

406
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,890
He has got a sense of humor.

407
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,260
He's so different

408
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,450
from what Ling Rui was like.

409
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,940
Don't you guys have work?

410
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,980
Back to your work.

411
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,260
-Let's go.
-What about you?

412
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,490
Where's Ling Rui?

413
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,170
He has a case discussion.

414
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,930
How am I supposed to get her phone number?

415
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,530
Come here. Let godfather hold you.

416
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,650
Careful, careful.

417
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,970
Youyou.

418
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,250
Can godfather ask you

419
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,010
a question?

420
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,690
Okay.

421
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,690
Do you know

422
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,810
your mom's friend

423
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,650
with the name, Tang Ping?

424
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,980
My mom's friend?

425
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,930
You know...

426
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,100
The one who

427
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,490
might be a little silly

428
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,210
when she looks at you,

429
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,740
and kind of stupid when she talks.

430
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,130
The one

431
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,370
who is stupid and loud

432
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,610
but still accepted by Mommy?

433
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,980
Yeah, it's her.

434
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,060
Do you have her phone number?

435
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,460
No.

436
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,380
But I have Mommy's number.

437
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,450
Well, can you give me

438
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,650
your mommy's number?

439
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,770
Come here.

440
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,420
-Professor Luo.
-Professor Luo.

441
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,370
Hello.

442
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,780
Hi, Professor Luo. My name is Youyou.

443
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,130
My daddy is Ling Rui.

444
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,770
Do you know me?

445
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,460
Yeah.

446
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,850
Daddy told me that

447
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,050
Professor Luo is his teacher,

448
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,820
just like his daddy.

449
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,420
So you're

450
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,900
like Youyou's grandpa,

451
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,090
very important.

452
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,330
What a smart kid.

453
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,450
You're

454
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,050
the pride of medicine

455
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,460
and the future of the general surgery department.

456
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,250
Wait a minute.

457
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,180
Come on, kid.

458
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,770
This is a gift from grandpa.

459
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,820
I specifically picked the one with pictures.

460
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,770
You can take a look.

461
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,340
I'll teach you whatever you don't understand.

462
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,170
Professor Luo, don't you think it's...

463
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,180
Grandpa.

464
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,220
When did my dad

465
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,300
read this book?

466
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,020
18 years old.

467
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,020
Freshman year.

468
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,340
Then, I can't read it now.

469
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,180
Why?

470
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,530
Because I'm only five years old.

471
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,690
If I read this book

472
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,970
so many years earlier than Daddy did,

473
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,010
Daddy might think that

474
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,730
I'm so much smarter than him.

475
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,010
He'll be sad.

476
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,380
Grandpa.

477
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,330
Let's just keep this

478
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,770
as our secret.

479
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,810
Don't make Daddy feel bad.

480
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,650
Our secret? Alright.

481
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,490
Here.

482
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,810
Let's keep this between us.

483
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,340
Okay.

484
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,570
-Pinky promise.
-Pinky promise.

485
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,420
This kid's too smart.

486
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,809
He's like a prodigy.

487
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,529
Dr. Ling was right.

488
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,100
We should worry about ourselves.

489
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm leaving.

490
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,049
Mom.

491
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,529
Auntie.

492
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:29,500
Auntie, I...

493
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm here to pick up my son.

494
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,289
I'm not here to do...

495
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,620
Bad things.

496
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,250
Why that reaction?

497
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,740
What's going on?

498
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,450
She...

499
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,530
What if your scream...

500
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh, no.

501
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,460
Disturbed our neighbors?

502
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,540
Did you just see a ghost?

503
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,690
Yeah.

504
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,180
Lu Fangning, the ghost.

505
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,930
She is right outside the door.

506
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,530
At the door.

507
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,330
I got this.

508
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,330
What are you doing?

509
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,890
Aunt...

510
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,500
Auntie...

511
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,010
I...

512
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,300
You're here all of a sudden.

513
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,810
I didn't have time to prepare.

514
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,170
Why don't you just keep

515
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,770
these books first?

516
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,490
We'll fill in the rest later.

517
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,420
By the way.

518
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,740
I highly recommend this one.

519
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,570
"Was It the Chocolate Pudding?"

520
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,580
You know what.

521
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,930
If things aren't well-handled,

522
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,970
more often than not,

523
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,180
children would see their parents' separation

524
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,100
as their fault.

525
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,010
Alright, that's it for now.

526
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,740
Okay.

527
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,130
Study hard.

528
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,130
Okay.

529
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,970
-I...
-Keep learning.

530
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,890
Okay. Uhm...

531
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,250
Two for the price of one?

532
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,410
Now I can't even

533
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,540
keep the little one.

534
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,610
"Mother Changes The Child's Life

535
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,220
Before The Age of 13."

536
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,820
"Who Took Away The Child's Happiness?"

537
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,970
Me?

538
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,530
"The Emotional Stages During Childhood and Adolescence."

539
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,620
"Mama and Papa Bear's Divorce."

540
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,770
What are you doing?

541
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm taking out the trash.

542
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,090
You've already opened the door.

543
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,450
It's my turn now.

544
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,130
I'll throw the trash in her face.

545
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,450
You'll only be violating public cleanliness.

546
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,410
Just one bag.

547
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,770
Go ahead.

548
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,730
Don't worry about her.

549
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,660
Here you go.

550
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,690
Look through it carefully.

551
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,730
Ling Rui and Youyou are in the hospital.

552
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,900
There's still someone

553
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,340
who's nice to me in this family.

554
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,770
Thanks.

555
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,810
I'll take the trash out for you.

556
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,380
Youyou, did you like the candy?

557
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,370
Let me take you

558
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,100
to get something better,

559
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,500
okay?

560
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,890
Thank you, sweet Sis.

561
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,370
So cute.

562
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,140
Let's go.

563
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,020
Don't let your guard down.

564
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,410
He really is something.

565
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,340
Get lost.

566
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,010
Why are you getting this everywhere?

567
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,940
Let me help you with it.

568
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,660
Dr. Yu.

569
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,940
Ling Rui's child?

570
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,370
Hi, Auntie. I've seen you before.

571
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,780
Have you?

572
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,970
Did the auntie see me

573
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,180
and then purposely walk around me?

574
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,140
Youyou, what did you just say?

575
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,820
This auntie

576
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,340
has got my attention.

577
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,130
Sis,

578
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't want to buy food anymore.

579
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,130
I'll be in the office and wait for Daddy.

580
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,170
Alright then, let's go.

581
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,730
Should I go in there?

582
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,180
If I go in now,

583
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,340
what would Ling Rui's colleagues think?

584
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,770
If I don't go in there,

585
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,210
it means I was

586
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,340
shut out of the door three times for nothing.

587
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,250
Which also means...

588
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,290
Which also means I carried these books for nothing.

589
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,770
How would I dare take the initiative?

590
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,450
I'd be lucky to get out of this in one piece.

591
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,290
We're off work now. I can finally ask you.

592
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,380
Is Dr. Ling's ex-wife

593
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,460
really that awesome?

594
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,810
Of course.

595
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,580
Or else, how could she

596
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,690
have given birth to such a smart kid like Youyou?

597
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,930
That's true.

598
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,010
But why

599
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,020
did she divorce Dr. Ling?

600
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,530
They said it was due to

601
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,810
incompatible personalities.

602
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,010
Divorce is actually something very normal.

603
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,770
But Director Ling

604
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,050
is so close to Dr. Yu.

605
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,260
Anyway, she is the ex-wife.

606
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,730
What ex?

607
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,140
Did Dr. Ling said that

608
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,220
he has got a girlfriend?

609
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,570
Cut the nonsense.

610
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,210
I saw it all.

611
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,130
Director Ling has the ring on his finger.

612
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,040
Stop it.

613
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,730
Tone it down. Don't let Youyou hear it.

614
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,260
It might leave a mark on the child.

615
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,800
Let's go.

616
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,490
[That's true.]

617
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,820
[I never even asked]

618
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,780
[if Ling Rui is still single.]

619
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,660
Auntie, would you like some candy?

620
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,100
I've got some really good candies.

621
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,580
No, thank you.

622
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,130
[Ling Rui's not here.]

623
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,250
[Should I just bring Youyou back?]

624
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,850
Am I cute, Auntie?

625
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,260
Cute.

626
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,980
There's no water.

627
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,930
I'll get it.

628
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,370
Auntie, have some water.

629
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,010
Thank you.

630
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,170
[What's wrong with Youyou?]

631
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,730
[He got won over so fast.]

632
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,900
[This doctor]

633
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,730
[looks kind of familiar.]

634
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,890
[Isn't she the one who had a blind date with Ling Rui?]

635
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,770
Auntie, do you like me?

636
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,940
Just so so.

637
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,890
That's what my little grandpa said.

638
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,820
You guys are alike.

639
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,410
I'm so unique.

640
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,740
How can I be like your grandpa?

641
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,890
We're not alike.

642
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,410
Little grandpa's so boring.

643
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,970
You're more interesting.

644
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,970
You think I'm very good?

645
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,700
Yeah.

646
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,730
What about your daddy?

647
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,860
Do you think he's good?

648
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,450
Of course, he is!

649
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,260
How about this?

650
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,860
Take your daddy as the standard.

651
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,940
Is there anyone around you

652
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,130
that is like your daddy?

653
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,660
Wouldn't that be perfect?

654
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,250
But someone like Daddy...

655
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,210
It's hard to find, right?

656
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,970
Your daddy already has your mommy.

657
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,370
Auntie is all alone.

658
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,090
I'm so lonely, kid.

659
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,810
Yu Shiyi.

660
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,650
The talented girl in med school.

661
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,730
Lu...

662
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,130
Nurse Liu.

663
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,180
How do I look?

664
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,620
Fine.

665
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,890
Compared to before?

666
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,140
As beautiful as ever.

667
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,850
Did I get it on my teeth?

668
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,730
No.

669
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,170
Youyou.

670
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,490
Mommy!

671
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,220
Mommy is here. Are you happy?

672
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,770
Yeah.

673
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,290
Go ahead. You can go to the toilet.

674
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,250
Mom, I don't want to go to the toilet.

675
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,450
Yes, you do.

676
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,780
Yeah.

677
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,530
I suddenly want to go to the toilet.

678
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,810
Good boy. Slowly.

679
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,580
Be careful.

680
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,220
Hello.

681
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,650
Hi, I'm Lu Fangning.

682
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,970
I know.

683
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,010
I'm Yu Shiyi.

684
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,090
I'm Youyou's mother,

685
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,570
Ling Rui's ex-wife.

686
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,770
I'm Ling Rui's classmate and colleague.

687
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,410
I know I have a pretty hand,

688
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,730
but Ms. Lu,

689
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,490
you don't have to

690
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,930
keep holding it.

691
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,610
I feel that

692
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,610
Youyou kind of like you.

693
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,970
This little guy

694
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,650
is slightly less annoying

695
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,130
compared to other kids.

696
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,090
[What is she trying to say?]

697
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,860
[Is she saying Youyou is annoying?]

698
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,690
Thanks.

699
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,460
It's probably because he inherited

700
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,050
some good genes from me and Ling Rui.

701
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,570
But I think

702
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,220
he's more similar to you, Ms. Lu.

703
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,500
[This woman...]

704
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,890
[Is she trying to say that Youyou isn't like Ling Rui?]

705
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,100
I know you.

706
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,050
Ling Rui told me that

707
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
you two were

708
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,140
in the same study group in college.

709
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,250
He said that

710
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,850
it was a very pure fellowship.

711
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,100
Young and naive.

712
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,850
Well, we were still immature.

713
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,570
But things are better now.

714
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,250
We're in the same department.

715
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,090
Our relationship could be closer.

716
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,530
[To what point?]

717
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,490
Speaking of which,

718
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,330
my relationship with Ling Rui

719
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,100
is much closer.

720
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,780
So close that we have a baby.

721
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,850
But I heard that

722
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,050
you two

723
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,420
have been divorced for six years.

724
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,370
You should know that

725
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,020
Ling Rui didn't even go to Germany for you.

726
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,410
Giving up his dream

727
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,780
for such

728
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,330
minor emotional injury.

729
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,770
It wasn't worth it.

730
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,210
Worth it or not

731
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,380
is not up to you.

732
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,970
Well, as far as I know,

733
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:32,810
because of me,

734
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,540
Ling Rui didn't even

735
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,730
change his phone number in the past six years.

736
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,570
He knew I had gastric problems.

737
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,650
So every time he saw me,

738
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,290
he'd tell me to

739
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,690
cut down on coffee.

740
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,970
The other day,

741
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,330
I was feeling just a bit unwell.

742
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,210
Straightaway, he dragged me to his office

743
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,210
to check on this

744
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,250
and that...

745
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,530
Checked on this...

746
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,770
Excuse me.

747
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,530
Ling Rui hasn't changed

748
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,530
his phone number

749
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,370
ever since college.

750
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,610
If it's really like

751
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,420
what you just said,

752
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,810
was he actually waiting for me?

753
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,460
Plus, Ling Rui is a doctor.

754
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,210
Don't you know

755
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,150
-how doctors are?
-Daddy.

756
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,090
-You're back.
-Everyone is somehow sick

757
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,490
-in our eyes.
-Why are you here?

758
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:12,930
Perhaps

759
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,170
when he saw you,

760
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,620
he thought your condition worsened.

761
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,970
Now, as for whether

762
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,490
it was worth it or not.

763
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,930
If it's not up to me,

764
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,770
is it up to you?

765
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,010
Of course, it's not up to me either.

766
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,900
Ling Rui's matter

767
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,180
can only be up to him.

768
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,490
That's right.

769
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,340
Then, how would you know that

770
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,690
he wouldn't be with me?

771
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,930
I just know.

772
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,770
Why?

773
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,690
Because Ling Rui is a virtuous person.

774
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,970
While he is good with me,

775
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,850
he would never

776
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,490
give other women

777
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,650
unnecessary attention.

778
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,100
Then, what about you?

779
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,090
Do you deserve

780
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,170
a good man like Ling Rui?

781
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,290
In the last six years,

782
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,170
was there never anyone else in your life?

783
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,220
Of course, I deserve him.

784
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,770
Besides,

785
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,330
I already have

786
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,250
a good man like Ling Rui.

787
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,620
Why would I be interested in someone else?

788
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,380
Why are you laughing?

789
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,490
Ms. Yu.

790
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
Dr. Yu.

791
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,260
Dr. Yu, I'm sorry.

792
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,700
Never mind.

793
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,980
Ling Rui.

794
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,330
When did you get here?

795
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,300
Just now.

796
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,620
That's just the way she is.

797
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,050
I apologize on her behalf.

798
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,450
It's alright.

799
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,460
I've understood everything

800
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,940
just now.

801
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,620
Why are you apologizing to me?

802
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,570
What did you understand?

803
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,730
For my sake, forget it.

804
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,450
I'll buy you a meal next time.

805
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,340
Good.

806
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,420
Then, let's go to the place

807
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,740
we used to go to all the time.

808
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,780
I'll keep that in mind.

809
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,290
No problem.

810
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,890
Ms. Yu.

811
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,620
Let's go.

812
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,100
Let's go.

813
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,530
Ling Rui.

814
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,570
I'm sorry.

815
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,580
I sort of

816
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,860
overreacted just now.

817
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,170
But...

818
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,050
But what?

819
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,850
I admit that my attitude was pretty bad back there.

820
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,220
But you didn't have to

821
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,900
apologize to Dr. Yu for me.

822
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,580
Really.

823
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,060
Did you defended her just now

824
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,690
because she's your...

825
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,140
My colleague and classmate.

826
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,250
I don't think so.

827
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,300
Lu Fangning.

828
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,570
Why did you

829
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,820
say those things

830
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,890
to Dr. Yu just now?

831
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,090
What did I say?

832
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,100
Things like I wouldn't get involved with anyone else,

833
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,020
that I'm the best man

834
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,260
in the world,

835
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,610
and that

836
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,330
you're not going to be with anyone else.

837
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,610
This is all because...

838
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,690
I was trying to protect him.

839
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,290
He's our son.

840
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,650
His image,

841
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,690
your image, and my image

842
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,130
are all important, right?

843
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,420
Mom, I wasn't there just now.

844
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,530
Youyou.

845
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,620
Cover your ears.

846
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,410
Mom, I'm covering my ears now,

847
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,980
but I can still hear you.

848
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,690
Then...

849
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,210
Then you just...

850
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,410
Just go and sit there.

851
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,620
Run. Move your short legs.

852
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,020
Okay.

853
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,740
You can say it now.

854
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,970
I...

855
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,860
I did this entirely for

856
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,970
the happiness of Youyou

857
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,090
in the future.

858
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,980
Really.

859
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,410
To be honest, Ling Rui,

860
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,450
I know you're a

861
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,450
mature man.

862
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,610
You have your requirements

863
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,810
concerning your family and relationships.

864
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,610
I can

865
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,260
fully understand it.

866
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,290
It's just that as Youyou's mom,

867
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,450
I think I have the right

868
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,460
to give you a heads up.

869
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,540
Just a heads up.

870
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,940
I think

871
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,260
she's not the kind of person

872
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,890
in every aspect...

873
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,460
Her personality, you know.

874
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,570
It's not exactly suitable to be Youyou's

875
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,540
stepmother.

876
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,900
That's all?

877
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,210
Yeah.

878
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,570
Okay.

879
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,410
I got it.

880
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,980
When I need something,

881
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,420
I'll let you know.

882
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,540
How about this.

883
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,860
I'll make a list of Youyou's preferences.

884
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,770
I'll text it to you later.

885
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,140
[The kind that you'll never find]

886
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,290
[for the rest of your life.]

887
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,460
Is there a reason that you're here?

888
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,540
If there's nothing,

889
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,580
I'll get going.

890
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,460
Youyou.

891
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,010
I got something.

892
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:42,970
What's the matter?

893
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,210
Can Youyou

894
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,460
come to my place tonight?

895
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,340
Lu Fangning.

896
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,220
We had a deal.

897
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,170
I know. I just thought that

898
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,530
Youyou is still young now.

899
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,570
And he had just accepted you.

900
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,730
If he keeps having to go back and forth

901
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,020
between different living environments,

902
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,610
I think he might not get used to this.

903
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,610
He might not sleep well either.

904
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,290
I don't think

905
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,330
he looked uncomfortable.

906
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,770
Youyou can't leave me.

907
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,490
Well, he can't live without me either.

908
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,700
We need to get along.

909
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
You can see

910
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,370
how happy

911
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,370
Youyou was

912
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,210
when he called me 'daddy'.

913
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,540
Then...

914
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,609
The three of us...

915
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,740
The three of us can get along together.

916
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,379
Okay.

917
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,060
Then, let the three of us get along together.

918
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,770
Tonight,

919
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,689
Youyou and I will go to your place.

920
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,050
You wait here for me.

921
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,050
I'll go back to my office

922
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,370
to take care of something.

923
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,899
Come here, Youyou.

924
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,169
Daddy.

925
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,010
Daddy.

926
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,740
Youyou.

927
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:45,859
You stay here and watch Mommy.

928
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,500
Wait for me here, okay?

929
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,730
Okay, Daddy.

930
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,169
-Leave Mommy to me.
-Good boy.

931
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,700
Mommy, be good.

932
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,970
My books are still in the office.

933
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,010
How was it?

934
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,860
Shouldn't you thank me for what happened just now?

935
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,970
Thank you for what?

936
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,340
Didn't you hear it?

937
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,620
Your ex-wife didn't get your son

938
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,530
a stepfather

939
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,210
in the last six years.

940
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,690
Obviously,

941
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm the catalyst

942
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,860
for your relationship.

943
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,090
She took the bait as soon as I put it out.

944
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,690
How have I not noticed that

945
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,210
you like to meddle in

946
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,490
other people's business so much?

947
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,690
Oh, please.

948
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,530
You sure enjoyed yourself

949
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,940
watching everything at the door just now.

950
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,770
Your ex-wife

951
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,250
looks intimidating,

952
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,010
but she's actually

953
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,180
not that scary.

954
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,010
Just fool her a bit,

955
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,250
and she would believe it.

956
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,970
So you enjoyed fooling her?

957
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,250
Can I?

958
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,090
I mean, think about it.

959
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,650
Let her get jealous every day,

960
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,650
and your progress with her

961
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,980
could speed up by four times.

962
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,580
You can take off the word 'ex' in no time.

963
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
Isn't that a good deal?

964
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,260
No, thank you.

965
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,570
Why?

966
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,050
It's not necessary.

967
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,770
Alright.

968
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,980
Then, you can just be alone

969
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,770
for the rest of your life.

970
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,900
I'm off to do my rounds.

971
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,150
[Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

972
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,450
I have to take this.

973
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,740
Hello.

974
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,090
Excuse me, are you...

975
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,100
Who is this?

976
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,450
Peng Bo, I'm Peng Bo.

977
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,250
Uhm...

978
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,650
Ms. Tang.

979
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,330
I'm wondering if you could take my phone...

980
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,340
Ms. Tang?

981
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,620
The evidence is solid,

982
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,370
and you still dare to deny it?

983
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,340
Miss Pingping.

984
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,180
Yeah.

985
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,810
That's right.

986
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,690
Listen.

987
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,220
I'm going to buy you a meal.

988
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,860
How about a barbecue?

989
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,900
Okay.

990
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,690
I'll see you later.

991
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,660
I got it.

992
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,340
Bye.

993
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,290
Bye.

994
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,540
Here, I grilled this for you.

995
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,530
-Eat up.
-Sir, all the dishes have been served

996
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Thank you, Miss Pingping.

997
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,700
I can finally have a piece of meat.

998
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,340
I've already eaten

999
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,330
salad for a month.

1000
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,130
I'm so tired of it.

1001
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,970
Miss Pingping.

1002
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,010
F you want to lose weight, you have to be persistent.

1003
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,490
Why don't you eat some vegetables?

1004
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:07,810
You...

1005
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,450
You eat it.

1006
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,940
Caramel Apple 120.

1007
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,130
What?

1008
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,170
Nothing.

1009
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,300
Caramel Apple 120.

1010
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,940
I'm here.

1011
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,460
Is there anything you want me to do?

1012
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,370
No, I'm just calling you.

1013
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,370
I think it's amazing.

1014
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,330
You are a doctor

1015
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,530
and a man.

1016
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,100
How would you be my biggest fan?

1017
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,170
Did you think

1018
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,930
I had the star aura

1019
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,900
from the first time you saw me?

1020
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,170
Yes.

1021
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,700
So?

1022
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,210
So what do you

1023
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,180
like about me?

1024
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,330
Because of this.

1025
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,290
I'm here again

1026
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,970
at LM Deer Sing Home Furnishing Store today.

1027
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,850
They smell very refreshing too.

1028
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,380
There's no smell of formaldehyde.

1029
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,570
[What formaldehyde?]

1030
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,700
[It's all a lie.]

1031
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,650
No.

1032
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,170
Why are you playing that video?

1033
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,050
Turn that off right now.

1034
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,130
It's not bad.

1035
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,570
Are you kidding me?

1036
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,890
Miss Pingping.

1037
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,980
I just think that

1038
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,130
you were very brave

1039
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,610
to go to LM Deer Sing at that time.

1040
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,930
Really?

1041
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah.

1042
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,300
So what other good qualities

1043
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,060
do I have?

1044
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,940
Give me more compliments.

1045
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,820
You...

1046
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,370
I don't think it's right to say in front of you.

1047
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,850
What's the big deal?

1048
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,770
As a fan,

1049
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,010
complimenting your idol

1050
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,420
should be a basic skill.

1051
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,420
I'll say more then.

1052
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,420
Go ahead.

1053
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,650
Even though you have bad acting skills, like to parade your ability,

1054
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,970
and you've done a lot of embarrassing things,

1055
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,140
I'd like to thank God that

1056
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,180
people don't take you

1057
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,700
as a villain.

1058
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,140
And you

1059
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,930
always do things

1060
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,210
without much consideration.

1061
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,180
You never think about the consequences.

1062
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,250
You've offended a lot of people,

1063
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,730
including the fans behind them.

1064
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,380
You may have

1065
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,300
a lot of haters than fans.

1066
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,170
I...

1067
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,090
But...

1068
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,020
But?

1069
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,610
I think that...

1070
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,860
It's because you're very simple.

1071
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,290
You would rather fight yourself

1072
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,300
than scheme

1073
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,810
against other people.

1074
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,210
You're very kind.

1075
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,090
You never do things

1076
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,290
that would hurt other people.

1077
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,500
Even if you liked Ling Rui,

1078
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,130
you didn't go

1079
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,290
and expose the contract marriage

1080
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,540
between Ling Rui and Lu Fangning, right?

1081
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,050
And most importantly,

1082
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,820
you've always been

1083
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,170
really, really,

1084
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,380
genuinely trying hard.

1085
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,020
Even if this doesn't work out,

1086
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,100
and the other one fails,

1087
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,580
even if you're bad at acting,

1088
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,090
even if you just can't make a breakthrough,

1089
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,610
so what?

1090
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,130
Am I right?

1091
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,700
All of us

1092
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,900
have your back.

1093
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,970
Although all of your compliments

1094
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,580
don't sound good,

1095
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,900
why do they make me cry so much?

1096
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,690
Let me have a look.

1097
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,490
It's my endorsement. I can use it.

1098
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,220
Uhm...

1099
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,300
Do you want to

1100
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,090
use the restroom and touch up your makeup?

1101
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,500
Daddy, here you go.

1102
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,300
Thank you.

1103
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,690
Youyou is such a good boy.

1104
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,700
You even know how to change your own shoes.

1105
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,210
Come.

1106
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,770
Youyou.

1107
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,780
Why don't you play with your toys?

1108
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,530
Daddy would like to

1109
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,530
have a talk with Mommy.

1110
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,300
Okay?

1111
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,180
Okay.

1112
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,490
That's my good boy.

1113
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,100
Is he really going to sleep here tonight?

1114
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,050
Is he...

1115
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,370
Is he going to sleep with me?

1116
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,650
Do I really have to seduce him?

1117
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,460
No, no.

1118
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,100
I thought you were getting me water.

1119
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,740
Why are you drinking it yourself?

1120
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,900
It's because...

1121
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,260
It's cold water.

1122
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,610
I want to get some hot water for you.

1123
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,890
I'll get you some hot water.

1124
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,820
Don't worry.

1125
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,130
I'll just drink this.

1126
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,650
Ling Rui.

1127
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,050
I think

1128
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,860
you might want to reconsider.

1129
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,610
You can

1130
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,690
go home tonight,

1131
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,460
and come to pick Youyou up tomorrow.

1132
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,370
You can come in the morning.

1133
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,090
Really.

1134
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,170
It won't take too much of

1135
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,330
your time together.

1136
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,050
Lu Fangning.

1137
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,330
I realized

1138
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,980
you really like to change your mind.

1139
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,060
To educate a child,

1140
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,740
the parents need to lead by example.

1141
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,900
No.

1142
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,250
It's just that

1143
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,130
I don't have your toothbrush,

1144
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,210
razor or anything else here.

1145
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,090
We can order them online.

1146
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,770
And the bedsheets,

1147
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,970
your clothes...

1148
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,010
I can use yours.

1149
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,450
Or...

1150
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,130
Do you mind?

1151
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,300
I don't mind.

1152
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,780
Why would I mind about it?

1153
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,220
But...

1154
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,140
But what?

1155
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,010
But I snore when I sleep.

1156
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,130
I didn't want to disturb your sleep.

1157
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,140
You never had that problem before.

1158
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,330
It just happened in the last six years.

1159
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,100
It's so bad that it can't even be cured.

1160
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,210
I mean it.

1161
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,540
So?
