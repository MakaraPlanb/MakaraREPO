[Begin Again]

3
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 05]

4
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,320
Here, right?

5
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,140
So shameless.

6
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,960
What?

7
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,660
I mean Gao Erfan.

8
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,779
I...

9
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,100
I feel much better. Thank you.

10
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Um...

11
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,570
My hand also aches.

12
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,690
Hand?

13
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,700
Maybe because

14
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,900
the glove is too tight.

15
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,500
It's probably the room service.

16
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,290
What's wrong?

17
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,460
Off you go.

18
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,770
The second guideline of a happy marriage,

19
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,090
wine and ambiance.

20
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,060
Ling Rui, Ling Rui.

21
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,580
How much alcohol can you take?

22
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,529
I've never

23
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:02,570
been drunk before.

24
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,890
This one is of high concentration of alcohol.

25
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,420
Let's have some wine

26
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,330
as a celebration.

27
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,650
I won't.

28
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,420
Wine does no good

29
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,460
to health.

30
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,010
But it does good to sleep.

31
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,450
You can sleep well when you feel calm.

32
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,340
I haven't had

33
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,930
the "cross-cupped wine" with you yet.

34
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,400
You asked the wedding MC

35
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,380
to change the "cross-cupped wine" part

36
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,130
into a lucky draw to give away furniture.

37
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,020
I know it.

38
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,300
Sometimes I appear

39
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,850
too push-and-go.

40
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,660
But I don't want to miss

41
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,900
the necessary procedure

42
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,980
in a marriage.

43
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,140
All right.

44
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,810
I won't push you.

45
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,540
I'll drink it myself.

46
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,380
Don't.

47
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,980
What are you doing?

48
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
This glass of wine is for me.

49
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,010
And this, for you.

50
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,460
I'll have one glass of wine.

51
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,770
Just one glass.

52
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,540
Wait a second.

53
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,820
Do you know...

54
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,770
Do you know...

55
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,220
Do you know...

56
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,010
Do you know that the heart?

57
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,530
Heart lies

58
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,970
between the chest and lungs,

59
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,380
about

60
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,980
one third

61
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,140
at the right side of the median line,

62
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,220
and about two thirds

63
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,700
at the left side of the median line.

64
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,140
As big as my fist.

65
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,660
-Ling Rui, can we...
-You.

66
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,970
Leave the heart aside for a moment?

67
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,490
Let me finish.

68
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,180
Its shape is like a peach,

69
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,250
like a pear grown askew.

70
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,740
Venous blood from the right ventricle

71
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,060
flows into the pulmonary artery

72
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,420
And then

73
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,060
flows into the capillary network

74
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,620
around pulmonary alveolus.

75
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,690
Through pulmonary artery

76
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,420
as well as its branches.

77
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,930
How come you're still a physician

78
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,460
when you're drunk?

79
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,330
Ling Rui.

80
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,300
Are you okay?

81
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,380
Ling Rui?

82
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,330
No, no, no.

83
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,290
No, no, no!

84
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,610
It's such a folly.

85
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,420
Lu Fangning.

86
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
You can't do this.

87
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,330
This is not what a gentlewoman should do.

88
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,090
By the way,

89
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:48,660
I can't just do it

90
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,050
by myself.

91
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,730
I can.

92
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,810
Who hit me?

93
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,170
Why are you staring at me
early in the morning?

94
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm frightened.

95
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,620
Didn't you say you've never been drunk?

96
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,500
Yeah, never have I...

97
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,330
Nothing happened between us

98
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,780
last night, right?

99
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,100
What do you think?

100
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,340
I'm kidding.

101
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,020
Let's go home.

102
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,850
I'll take care of you at home.

103
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,650
This feels right.

104
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,930
Ningning.

105
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,210
Fangning.

106
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,980
Simon?

107
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,820
Simon!

108
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,220
You are finally back!

109
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,060
You've been away for so long.

110
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,340
Are you going to leave again this time?

111
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,450
Anyway,

112
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,210
I won't let you go

113
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,020
even if you mean to leave.

114
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,860
I'll hold onto you

115
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,420
so you can never

116
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,530
have the chance to

117
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,500
just walk away.

118
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,780
But it'd be better if you come back

119
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,380
one day earlier.

120
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,770
You could have attended my wedding then.

121
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,740
But it was just a marketing conference.

122
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,050
Forget about it.

123
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,740
You're a grown-up.

124
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,780
How could you kid

125
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,330
about your wedding?

126
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,140
You have the gut to blame me?

127
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,740
You've been away for ten years.

128
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,850
Ling Rui.

129
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,820
This is Simon,

130
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,890
my little uncle.

131
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,690
I am Lu Yiyao.

132
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,530
I'm Ling Rui.

133
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,450
Simon is finally back.

134
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,890
That's great.

135
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,140
You look happy.

136
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,290
Of course.

137
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,250
He was away for ten years

138
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,340
and no one could

139
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,290
persuade him to come back.

140
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,100
I don't know why

141
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,170
he figured it out this time.

142
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,780
He looks young

143
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,580
and does not look like your uncle.

144
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,260
Actually, he was adopted by my family.

145
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,050
He is more like a brother

146
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,290
who watched me growing up.

147
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,260
He treats me so well.

148
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm done. Your turn.

149
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
Be serious about it.

150
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,490
Simon is my favorite person

151
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,900
in this house,

152
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,020
the current house.

153
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,610
Alright.

154
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,020
Where are you going?

155
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm going to find Simon.

156
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
I have so much to tell him.

157
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,580
You just leave me alone here?

158
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,220
It's good for you to be here.

159
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,860
No one

160
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,010
will disturb you.

161
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,650
It's daytime anyway,

162
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,610
so it's safe here. Rest assured.

163
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,650
Didn't you say

164
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,340
you would look after me

165
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,820
on the way here?

166
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
What's wrong?

167
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,300
We're newlyweds.

168
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,660
And this is our first day home.

169
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,410
I know that.

170
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,660
To make it convincing

171
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,860
to your families,

172
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,540
shouldn't we be

173
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,930
better prepared?

174
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,610
You can be assured.

175
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,580
No one is my match

176
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,170
in this family.

177
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,850
Really?

178
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,900
Although Lu Fangyu

179
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,420
is clear about our relationship,

180
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,130
he is just

181
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,100
a mascot

182
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,740
that can talk.

183
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,020
Don't mind him.

184
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,010
As for Yang Yi,

185
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,250
she earnestly wishes that

186
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,820
we'll divorce as soon as possible.

187
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,650
She wants to see me sad,

188
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,890
and crying all day.

189
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,860
But she is not worthy of

190
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,290
being mentioned for her low level.

191
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,020
Want some?

192
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,700
But,

193
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,010
I don't understand

194
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,820
what my father is thinking this time.

195
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,100
To my surprise,

196
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,850
he just allowed us

197
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,890
to get married

198
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,220
although we've only known each other
for five days.

199
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,340
I wonder

200
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,410
what is he thinking?

201
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,900
What about Simon?

202
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,250
Why don't you mention him?

203
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,500
My little uncle

204
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,940
seems to be

205
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,730
normal and tranquil.

206
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,450
But he knows everything clearly.

207
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,580
He just doesn't say it.

208
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,580
He is the cleverest person

209
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,570
in the family,

210
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,290
save me, of course.

211
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,610
You don't worry about him?

212
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,690
No need at all.

213
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,330
He treats me really well.

214
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,900
And he is the one I trust the most

215
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,020
in the family.

216
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,330
And he also trusts me.

217
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,130
To fully achieve the contract,

218
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,060
I assumed a proper setting

219
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,130
for our relationship.

220
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,290
Come in.

221
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,100
Fangning. Dr. Ling.

222
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,290
The food is ready.

223
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,570
You can have some fruit first.

224
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,850
Thank you, Aunt Gao.

225
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,460
Aunt Gao has been working

226
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,300
at our home for years.

227
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,610
She cooks very well.

228
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,220
Thank you, Aunt Gao.

229
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,780
I don't want it.

230
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,570
This strawberry

231
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,580
seems tasty.

232
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,540
I'd like to taste it.

233
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,370
Don't move.

234
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,680
I assume we should be

235
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,360
deeply attached to each other.

236
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,850
Aunt Gao is watching us at the door.

237
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,260
She left.

238
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,850
Aunt Gao

239
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,140
seemed to be looking for something.

240
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,010
My son.

241
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,290
Mom,

242
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,130
why didn't you knock at the door?

243
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,100
Why should I knock

244
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,010
since it's my son's room?

245
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,360
What are you watching?

246
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,700
What?

247
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,049
-Let me see.
-Nothing.

248
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,370
Don't watch it too much.

249
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,340
It's bad for your body.

250
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,500
Mom, what are you talking about?

251
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,610
What do you wanna say again?

252
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,019
Your dad has always wanted

253
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:28,900
Lu Fangning to get married.

254
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,410
And now,

255
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,049
they live with us here.

256
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,059
Your dad

257
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,539
can't be happier.

258
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,530
She got a new brand for her marriage.

259
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,010
What a good deal.

260
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,460
Lu Fangyu.

261
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,650
What, Mom?

262
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,450
You go get married too.

263
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,500
Your dad may get you a new brand

264
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,180
if he's happy.

265
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,020
You don't have to

266
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,500
watch those anymore.

267
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,960
I...

268
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,700
I'll go become a monk now.

269
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,610
Forget about it.

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,540
It's good now.

271
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,650
Otherwise, I may have to

272
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,900
take care of my daughter-in-law.

273
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,010
I think she should be the one to serve you.

274
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,260
Yes!

275
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,460
Get married.

276
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,380
She'll have kids after getting married.

277
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,620
If she gets pregnant,

278
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,340
then she won't have time to run the company.

279
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,060
It'll be yours then.

280
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,060
Mom,

281
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,610
there is Uncle Simon

282
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,500
managing the company.

283
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,480
I wanna stay out of

284
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,420
the awful mess.

285
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,940
Pregnant.

286
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,820
Well,

287
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,100
how can I get her pregnant?

288
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,020
How can I get her pregnant?

289
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,370
Knock before you come in next time.

290
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,660
Lu Fangyu, bring our uncle here.

291
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,570
-Okay.
-Go.

292
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,530
They're here.

293
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,450
-Coming.
-Uncle.

294
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
Here. Take a seat.

295
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,040
Son, you can sit here.

296
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,290
I can sit here...

297
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,020
Never mind, sit here.

298
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,850
-Next to me.
-Okay.

299
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,180
Brother,

300
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,920
you sit over there.

301
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,340
Take your seat.

302
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,890
Isn't there a seat?

303
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,620
Go over there.

304
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,460
Just go.

305
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,090
How was it going over there?

306
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,970
Quite good.

307
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,970
What's wrong?

308
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,420
Mascot.

309
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,090
Troublemaker.

310
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,210
Old and wicked.

311
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,060
And,

312
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,490
the cleverest.

313
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,370
I hold my alcohol better now.

314
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,970
Ling,

315
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,100
this is the first time you dine at home

316
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,380
since you're married.

317
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,930
I wonder if the dishes

318
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,740
suit your taste.

319
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,500
It's okay.

320
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm not picky, aunt.

321
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,180
That's right.

322
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,380
Especially the young people,

323
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,530
don't be picky with food.

324
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,900
Health is the most important.

325
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,580
Here.

326
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,700
Eat this.

327
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,770
Enjoy it.

328
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,420
Thank you, Dad.

329
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,380
Good.

330
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,460
We were both drunk at that time.

331
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,220
Stop chatting.

332
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,700
Focus on the dishes, come.

333
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,650
I shouldn't have asked you.

334
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,780
You were away for so long.

335
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,660
Here, try this.

336
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,780
How is it?

337
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,100
Good.

338
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,960
Nice.

339
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,780
It's so good that you are back.

340
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm telling you...

341
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,010
Ningning,

342
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,620
you've had a hard couple of days.

343
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,970
You should eat more.

344
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,130
Hard?

345
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,020
Ling Rui,

346
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,340
did you sleep late

347
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,620
at your wedding night

348
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,930
yesterday?

349
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,260
Fangyu.

350
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,850
All these dishes still

351
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,060
can't shut your mouth?

352
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,780
Fangning.

353
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,530
Well,

354
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,580
now that you're married,

355
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,930
you should start planning

356
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,970
your future, right?

357
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,780
You're not young anymore.

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,730
Your dad can't wait any longer, either.

359
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,050
Why don't you put it on the agenda

360
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,620
to have a baby?

361
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,940
Yea, we should.

362
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,370
Really?

363
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,540
Glad that you think the same!

364
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,890
I'm so pleased.

365
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,540
You're too slim.

366
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,940
Eat something good

367
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,330
to get into shape.

368
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,540
Eat some sea cucumber and bird-nests,

369
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,090
also pork liver.

370
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,100
With good circulation,
you'll conceive more easily.

371
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,980
Do you have someone to cook for you?

372
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,370
If not, I can cook some

373
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,900
and send them to you.

374
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
Alright.

375
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,170
You don't have to care so much.

376
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,900
These loving couples

377
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,810
care for each other.

378
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,290
Why bother?

379
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,060
They got married when the time came.

380
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,540
So, when the time comes,

381
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,340
they will naturally

382
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,260
have a baby.

383
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,370
Why are you in such a rush?

384
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,730
I don't think so.

385
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,810
Aunt Yang,

386
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,490
does the diet plan work?

387
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,730
Of course!

388
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,930
See? My son. It does work!

389
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,220
Ningning, Ningning.

390
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,900
Ningning.

391
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,050
You should think twice.

392
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,940
You'll have a useless kid

393
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,610
if you

394
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,810
follow this diet plan.

395
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,060
Dad.

396
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,740
Why am I useless?

397
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,220
How could they get married

398
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,170
if it weren't me?

399
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,340
Fangyu,

400
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,820
she knew Ling Rui

401
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,170
because of you?

402
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,900
Yeah... No...

403
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,610
Yes.

404
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,260
Fangyu went to the hospital

405
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
and I met Ling Rui.

406
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Hospital?

407
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,260
What happened?

408
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,900
-Mom.
-Why did you go to the hospital?

409
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,330
I'm fine, mom.

410
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,530
He was sick because…

411
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,370
It was

412
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,490
hard to tell.

413
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
What?

414
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,090
You...

415
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,810
I've told you not to spend too much time
on your phone.

416
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,580
See? Now you're sick.

417
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,970
Son, it matters a lot!

418
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,450
-Mom.
-How will you have kids?

419
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,690
Mom, you think too much.

420
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,570
Stop looking at your phone.

421
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,500
I don't wanna talk.

422
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
Let me have my meal.

423
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,100
You should've done it earlier.

424
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,050
Cheers.

425
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:27,980
Okay.

426
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,300
We don't have to drink wine sneakily

427
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
as we did when we were little.

428
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,220
We can feel free to drink now.

429
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,500
We were

430
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,890
so anxious

431
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,580
as we did it covertly.

432
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,130
Ningning, try this.

433
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,330
Fangning doesn't like fat meat.

434
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,300
Does she?

435
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,810
Tastes good. Thanks, darling.

436
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,290
Enjoy it.

437
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,340
Simon,

438
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,650
you may not know that her taste has changed

439
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,170
since you were away

440
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,100
for so long.

441
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,780
No, I know.

442
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,450
Fangning likes peppery chicken the most.

443
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,300
Right?

444
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,730
Ningning.

445
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,930
Eat more vegetables.

446
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,050
Now, you even

447
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,980
like the vegetables

448
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,820
you hated the most?

449
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
My throat has been bothering me lately.

450
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,650
I should eat some vegetables.

451
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,580
It is not enough.

452
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,900
You've been so tired these days,

453
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,180
have more meat.

454
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,490
Otherwise,

455
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,300
how can you

456
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,220
make it through the night?

457
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,970
Darling, as I say,

458
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,410
you are more tired.

459
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,860
It's so good.

460
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,770
Thank you, honey.

461
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,890
Love you.

462
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,820
Eat your meal.

463
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,370
Enjoy yourselves.

464
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,980
You behaved well,

465
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,820
Mr. Ling Rui.

466
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,300
That's impressive.

467
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,540
You were good too,

468
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,820
Ms. Fangning.

469
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,890
Fangning.

470
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,090
Uncle.

471
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Hey, Simon.

472
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,170
We are

473
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,420
putting in a lot of effort to enjoy the sea.

474
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,180
I brought her a wedding gift.

475
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,380
I don't know what she likes now

476
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,940
since I was away for so many years.

477
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,210
Don't you know her well?

478
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,020
What do you think she likes?

479
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,250
Of course, I know.

480
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,700
She likes me

481
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,010
the most.

482
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,530
Oh, come on.

483
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,940
Ling Rui.

484
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,620
I'm sorry

485
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
to disturb you two.

486
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,140
Can you

487
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,060
give us a minute?

488
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,370
No problem.

489
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,530
Honey,

490
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,970
I'll go back then.

491
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,940
Come back early.

492
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,260
Off you go.

493
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,250
Wait for me.

494
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,300
I will.

495
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,290
He is so clingy about me.

496
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,050
Guess what it is.

497
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,290
A bag?

498
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,420
Wine?

499
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,570
Open it.

500
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,100
This is?

501
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,250
Dala horse.

502
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,620
It was a handicraft

503
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,610
made by Swedish carpenters

504
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,740
long time ago

505
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
to carry their wishes to the families.

506
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,940
Thank you, uncle.

507
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,660
You don't blame me

508
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,700
for my sudden marriage, right?

509
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,890
Fangning.

510
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,340
You always know what you want.

511
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,940
As long as you're sure

512
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,740
you're doing the right thing,

513
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,820
I'm not worried then.

514
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm sure.

515
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,380
Okay.

516
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,170
Then, I'll wait and see.

517
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,180
See if this man

518
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,060
can bring you happiness.

519
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,380
By the way, Fangning.

520
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,170
Although the proposal of Infinity

521
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,100
has been adopted,

522
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,180
we still have

523
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,130
a lot of work to do.

524
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,700
You must be stressed out.

525
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,650
Relax,

526
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,650
I'll get your back

527
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,300
and protect LM Deer Sing Group.

528
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,090
Thank you.

529
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,100
Thank you for coming back.

530
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,180
Have you got over the jet lag?

531
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,090
I'm alright.

532
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,330
I can fall asleep. Don't worry.

533
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,340
I can drink wine with you

534
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,050
if you can't sleep.

535
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,780
Good then.

536
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,060
No kidding,

537
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,900
did you also prepare

538
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,810
anything else for me?

539
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,850
Well...

540
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,540
Are you okay?

541
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,290
What are you doing?

542
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,530
Your hair got wet.

543
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,060
You're just

544
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,210
messing up my hair.

545
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,250
It was already a mess

546
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,500
and wet. Don't move.

547
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,610
It looks better now.

548
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,130
Honey.

549
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,380
The wind is strong here.

550
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,130
You may catch a cold,

551
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,100
then you'll get a flu

552
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,890
which will lead to many complications.

553
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,170
And they can

554
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,740
do harm to your brain.

555
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,500
Fangning, I'm going upstairs.

556
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,610
Uncle, you are wet too.

557
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,740
Use this.

558
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,620
No need.

559
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,970
I feel cool this way.

560
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,090
Let's have a drink tonight, uncle.

561
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,820
No problem.

562
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,050
What are you doing?

563
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,460
I thought it was done.

564
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,580
I'm curious, Ling Rui.

565
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,010
You've been acting weirdly today.

566
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,180
You are weird, I think.

567
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,620
What's wrong with me?

568
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,020
What did you talk about

569
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,420
with Simon?

570
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,530
Fangyu is not only a mascot.

571
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,090
Aunt Yang is not like a troublemaker.

572
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,220
There is no bad intention

573
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,580
on your dad's mind.

574
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,220
But, Lu Yiyao

575
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,490
is indeed the cleverest

576
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,730
in the family.

577
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,250
He is also the one

578
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,420
who can see through us the most easily.

579
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,370
No, no, no.

580
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,340
I am the cleverest person

581
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,820
in the family.

582
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,460
And he just said

583
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
he wanted me to be happy.

584
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,820
According to the contract,

585
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,140
we'll get divorced one year later.

586
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,780
I'm afraid no one would take this

587
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,940
as happiness.

588
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,290
If he really accepts

589
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,700
every decision you make,

590
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,300
he wouldn't have

591
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,290
sounded me out like that just now.

592
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,140
He is indeed the one who knows me the best.

593
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,760
We can't go on like this.

594
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,780
Being alert all the time,

595
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,370
we'll both be tired then.

596
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,100
Then what should we do?

597
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,780
We can only stay in the room

598
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,970
till night

599
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,420
and enjoy the time for ourselves,

600
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,540
refusing all disturbances.

601
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,860
Ling Rui.

602
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,860
About some things,

603
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,770
you can't say too much.

604
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,050
Because I'll take that

605
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,130
seriously then.

606
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,370
Don't think too much.

607
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
I'll sleep on the floor.

608
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Come on.

609
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,620
Darling.

610
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,740
Come sleep with me.

611
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,940
When I'm going to sleep,

612
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,250
I'd like to spray some…

613
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,180
What are you doing?

614
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,650
Are you really gonna sleep on the floor?

615
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,380
Didn't we say to enjoy the time for us?

616
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,300
You sleep on the bed.

617
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,650
I'll sleep on the floor.

618
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,010
No way.

619
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,820
They'll find out if they come in.

620
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,540
I've locked the door.

621
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,410
If you know locking the door,

622
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,020
you should know what to do next.

623
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,130
I'm kidding.

624
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,880
Alright.

625
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,340
Come here.

626
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,300
You have to work tomorrow.

627
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,020
I always work overtime at the hospital.

628
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,730
I'm used to this.

629
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,780
Working overtime?

630
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,340
Come here. We can share the bed.

631
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,680
I have a good sleeping habit.

632
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,060
I won't touch you.

633
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,690
I'm not that kind of person.

634
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,450
Good night.

635
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,900
The third guideline of a happy marriage.

636
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,380
Acting actively or passively.

637
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,130
First, I have to act.

638
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,490
Good night.

639
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,380
So sleepy.

640
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,780
Ling Rui.

641
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,770
Ling Rui.

642
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,419
Ling Rui!

643
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,330
Don't go.

644
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:45,939
Okay.

645
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,899
Easy, easy.

646
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:47,689
I'm here with you.

647
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,300
Just sleep.

648
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,850
What do you mean by this?

649
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,860
What are you doing?

650
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,810
I can't

651
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,890
move at all.

652
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,260
You can calm down for a while.

653
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,650
Ling Rui.

654
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,100
Ling Rui.

655
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:46,890
Ling Rui.

656
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,500
Ling Rui!

657
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,260
What is the brand of his body wash?

658
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,530
Smells nice.

659
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,420
Would you like some?

660
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,370
No, thank you.

661
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,620
She can't fall asleep again?

662
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,780
Fangning has insomnia.

663
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,170
She is always like this.

664
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,980
The slightest sound can wake her up.

665
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,130
She'd feel better after drinking some milk.

666
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,260
You do know her well.

667
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,020
My parents passed away

668
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,970
when I was little.

669
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,820
I was adopted by her family from then.

670
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,500
I was probably sort of uncomfortable

671
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,090
at first.

672
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,010
I only had her.

673
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,140
She was just born at that time.

674
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,090
I liked staring at her so much.

675
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,860
She could say nothing.

676
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,100
She knew nothing.

677
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,690
She didn't show care

678
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,140
and protection

679
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,450
in a cautious way.

680
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,930
She didn't put a feeler.

681
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,460
Fangning is always ambitious

682
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,660
and bad-tempered.

683
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,090
Actually,

684
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,740
she'll bury her scars inside

685
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,060
once she gets hurt.

686
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,380
Throughout all these years,

687
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,970
she has always insisted on founding Infinity,

688
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,540
that means she still can't let it go.

689
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,010
The foundation of Infinity

690
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,090
has something to do with her past?

691
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,410
You don't know about this?

692
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,370
That is to say

693
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,740
she does not trust you as I imagined.

694
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,460
I know that

695
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,890
You don't believe

696
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,020
our marriage.

697
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,290
Or,

698
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,890
you don't believe in me.

699
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,570
Yes.

700
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,860
Maybe,

701
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,260
Fangning is still hiding something from me.

702
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,740
But if she doesn't want to tell me,

703
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,180
I won't try to

704
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,530
pry into her mind.

705
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,580
In this world,

706
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,090
even if you're a family

707
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,740
or a couple,

708
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,370
no matter how close your relationship is,

709
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,460
they all enjoy the freedom

710
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,700
to have their own secrets.

711
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,020
Am I right?

712
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,420
Thank you.

713
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,140
Ling Rui.

714
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
I don't know what's going on

715
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,810
between you two.

716
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,340
But listen to me carefully.

717
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,740
I won't let anyone

718
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,850
have any chance to hurt her.

719
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,330
Lu Yiyao,

720
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,530
I don't know what's going on

721
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,970
between you two, either.

722
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,250
But listen to me,

723
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,340
the one who hurts her

724
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,700
definitely won't be me.
