00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Flu

5
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,320
is contagious.

6
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,440
The effect's so strong?

7
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,840
What is in that soup?

8
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,770
Whatever, come on.

9
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,830
-No.
-Why are you hesitating?

10
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,170
-What are you doing?
-Come down.

11
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
We have to

12
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
talk about it tonight.

13
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,410
Why did you tie me up again?

14
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
I don't feel comfortable like this.

15
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,680
Ling Rui.

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,690
Ling Rui.

17
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,600
So,

18
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,170
you married me

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,430
just to legally get...

20
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,290
my...

21
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,480
Alright.

22
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
I completely understand

23
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
why you, Lu Fangning,

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,970
would do this.

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
It's just... Why me?

26
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,130
Why not you?

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,920
You're handsome and well-educated.

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
You have a good personality.

29
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,800
Of course, it's you.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,950
Besides, you still owe me money.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
You have to pay your debt.

32
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,130
It's perfectly fair.

33
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,880
Don't worry.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,450
After I have a baby,

35
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,890
I'm not gonna bother you.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,170
Our marriage

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,279
will automatically end in a year

38
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,930
as we agreed on the contract.

39
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,490
Of course,

40
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,920
the baby will be mine.

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,490
But, you're still the father.

42
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,330
You can see the kid whenever you want.

43
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,010
I would never stop you.

44
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,850
However,

45
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,330
if one day

46
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,810
you have a new relationship,

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,529
I'm not gonna let the baby

48
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,529
call that woman mother.

49
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,480
So,

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,279
you have never had any intention

51
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,890
to keep the father of the child?

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm perfectly capable of handling

53
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,800
the risks and responsibilities

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,770
of raising a baby.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,330
Besides,

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,750
I have a stable financial income

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,290
to give the kid the best possible life,

58
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,800
education,

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,560
and all my care and love.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,050
I'll be with him as he grows up.

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,960
Why

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,250
does he need a father?

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,210
It's not a question of necessity.

64
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,479
Then what's the problem?

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,770
Ling Rui.

66
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,480
You've got to open your mind.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
Think of it as

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,250
helping a lovely girl

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,160
who wants a baby,

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,810
but can't have one by herself.

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,530
I can't do this alone.

72
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,080
I can't do mitosis.

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,130
Of course, I need your help.

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,370
Ling Rui.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,570
Look at me.

76
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,550
Look at me.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,440
Being with a girl as attractive as me,

78
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,210
someone else would have been
attracted a long time ago.

79
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,690
Someone else?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
So if it's not me,

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,000
you would've found someone else

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,080
to carry out your plan?

83
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,800
Can't I?

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
You can't!

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,720
Two mature adults

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,230
raising a child together

87
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,880
would meet a lot of problems,

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,050
let alone someone like you

89
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,410
who's childish and ridiculous.

90
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,160
Childish?

91
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,130
Childish?

92
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,010
I thought of your feelings

93
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,890
and your ego,

94
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,600
so I stayed there

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
for such a long time,

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,880
and you call that childish?

97
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,160
Immature?

98
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,240
How do you know I'm immature?

99
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,120
Have you ever seen me doing anything

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,200
before you said that?

101
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,400
Anyway, I'm not going to

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,170
have a baby with you.

103
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,160
A baby should be a gift

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
to two adults who are in love.

105
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,359
We're not.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,970
How do you know we're not?

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,480
I love you.

108
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,680
I like you.

109
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,240
No.

110
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,560
It's not up to you.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,320
You're just saying no to anything.

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Why are you such a pain in the ass?

113
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,930
Anyway, I'm not gonna

114
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,080
have a baby with you.

115
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,530
And, you will never do it

116
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,410
with someone else too.

117
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,490
I'm going home for a few days.

118
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:27,800
Ling Rui.

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
-Don't look for me.
-Ling Rui.

120
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,600
Ling Rui!

121
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,240
One more.

122
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,080
How about I feed it into your mouth?

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
Have you ever stopped eating?

124
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,450
Ling Rui.

125
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,040
Why did you come back at such late hours?

126
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,770
I have something to do.

127
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,290
What is it?

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,410
Why are you home so late?

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,250
Where is your coat?

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,370
My coat...

131
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,250
I left it at the hospital today.

132
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,690
I had surgeries all day.

133
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm too tired.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

135
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,490
Did you

136
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,650
have a fight with Lu Fangning?

137
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,000
Fight?

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,240
How could I possibly fight with her?

139
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,650
It's nothing like that.

140
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,359
I'm going to bed. Good night.

141
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, off you go.

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,930
Are you hungry?

143
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,810
No, I'm fine.

144
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,850
What happened to Ling Rui?

145
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,200
Came back to his mother's house
in the middle of the night.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
What are you talking about?

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
How could you

148
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,930
say that?

149
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,480
He's a man.

150
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,010
Can't he just come home?

151
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,840
She's not wrong.

152
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
You're his mother.

153
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,530
Sister.

154
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
Why don't you go to sleep? It's late.

155
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,010
Alright, go to sleep then.

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,370
Don't you want to sleep?
You're still eating?

157
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,360
Go to sleep.

158
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
No.

159
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,840
You...

160
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,600
Wait a minute.

161
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,040
Hurry up.

162
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

163
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm just using the toilet.

164
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,800
Keep your voice down.

165
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,130
Look.

166
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,680
Ling Rui has been

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,530
cleaning up since the morning,

168
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,610
from this side to that side

169
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,120
and back and forth

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,930
for a long time.

171
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,410
Isn't it normal

172
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,640
for him to clean the table?

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,440
Cut the crap.

174
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
Is that normal?

175
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,170
When was

176
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,450
the last time he was like this?

177
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,930
Last time?

178
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,290
When was the last time?

179
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,770
Nothing like this happened before.

180
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,450
No.

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,720
Yazhi, go ask him.

182
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,890
No.

183
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,730
-Go.
-Go.

184
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,720
Ling Rui.

185
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,290
Did you fight with Fangning?

186
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:44,880
Return me my money.

187
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,650
I'll leave you to it then.

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,530
See? I told you I can't.

189
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,520
Why did you send me?

190
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,640
Sister, why don't you go?

191
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,720
Me?

192
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,480
He has always listened to you
since he was a kid.

193
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,250
He'll do whatever you tell him to.

194
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,970
You're his mother. Let's go together.

195
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,130
-Let's go, Yazhi.
-Let's go.

196
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,200
Ling Rui.

197
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,560
Today is the weekend.

198
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,440
Why don't you stay with your wife at home,

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
but come here?

200
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,320
Son, will you stop doing that?

201
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
You have been doing this

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,680
from here to there

203
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,770
and the other way around.

204
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,290
You haven't taken any rest.

205
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,930
Good boy, come here. Take a break.

206
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,810
Take a break,

207
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,610
okay?

208
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,520
Be good.

209
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,680
Hi.

210
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,090
Mom and aunts,

211
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,800
here comes your daughter-in-law.

212
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,560
Here.

214
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,920
Help me get the stuff inside.

215
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,150
Fangning is here.

216
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,440
Hi.

217
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,290
What's going on here?

218
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm going to visit

219
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,000
a friend of mine who lives nearby.

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
Her little baby

221
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,080
is one year old.

222
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,150
These are all the things

223
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,280
that I plan to give her.

224
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,890
You have friends

225
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,480
who live at places like this?

226
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,560
Of course.

227
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,320
Alright, you take a seat.

228
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,490
I go get you some fruits.

229
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,680
Mom, please sit.

230
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,210
Hold on, hold on.

231
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,320
Sit here.

232
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,160
What is this?

233
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,480
These are socks for

234
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,080
the little babies.

235
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,730
With their little feet inside,

236
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,210
it's so cute.

237
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,370
It's so soft and tender.

238
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,290
Mom, look.

239
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,040
What's this for?

240
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,520
This is to put under the heads

241
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,730
of the little babies.

242
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,050
Their little heads on top of it.

243
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,730
Such a pleasant view.

244
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,210
This one's so soft, too.

245
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:12,920
Feel it, mom.

246
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,360
You opened the things

247
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,400
that you're going to give others.

248
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,850
How are you supposed to give it away?

249
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,600
No problem.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,930
I'll just put it in later.

251
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,760
I can imagine

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,970
the little babies' little arms,

253
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,810
little feet

254
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,760
that look like little lotus roots,

255
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,010
soft and tender.

256
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,090
Imagine them kicking their little legs

257
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,410
and stretching their arms,

258
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,490
it melts my heart.

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,720
Do you like kids?

260
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,280
Of course, mom.

261
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,560
In the future,

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
when you have your own

263
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,330
grandchildren,

264
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm sure you'd love them too.

265
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,550
Take a look.

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,070
Ling Rui.

267
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,050
Mom.

268
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,560
Do you remember the friend
you play cards with?

269
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,530
Which one?

270
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,210
The one who rarely talks, but plays fast,

271
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,650
and always lets you win.

272
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,680
Ever since she got a grandson,

273
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,090
you haven't seen her anymore.

274
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,400
Didn't you tell me that

275
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,760
she cried when she told you,

276
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,400
after having a grandson,

277
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,650
she was surrounded
by diapers and milk bottles,

278
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,360
and had to take care of the baby
all night?

279
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,880
So,

280
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,410
you think it's going to be

281
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,840
troublesome for you to have a baby?

282
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,720
It's a real pain in the ass.

283
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't think

284
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm gonna take care of your kids.

285
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,280
Is that right, sister?

286
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah, we won't.

287
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,400
Mom, I haven't...

288
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,720
Didn't you just say that...

289
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,170
Mom, I...

290
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,090
You know what? Never mind.

291
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,410
Please ask Ling Rui about this.

292
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,450
What's going on?

293
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,000
What's going on?

294
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,000
What the hell is going on?

295
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,040
What's up with all that?

296
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,530
Fangning.

297
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,850
Sit over there.

298
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,130
Move over and let me sit down.

299
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,210
Fanning.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,160
Try this tea.

301
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,080
Thank you, aunt.

302
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,920
When I went out

303
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,640
for inspiration last time,

304
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,000
I watched the old farmer cooked this.

305
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,280
Aunt.

306
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
I've been preparing myself for pregnancy,

307
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,610
so I can't drink tea.

308
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,240
Look.

309
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,080
A lot of people think that

310
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
career-minded women like us

311
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,080
don't have time

312
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
to take care of the kids.

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,040
But it was a misunderstanding.

314
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,130
Look at me.

315
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm fully prepared

316
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
to welcome

317
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
the baby.

318
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,080
Because motherhood is strong.

319
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,000
Our children are our backbones.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,880
Isn't that right?

321
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,600
Aunt.

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,690
I'll drink it.

323
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,570
I apologize on behalf of Fangning.

324
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,440
She definitely didn't mean that

325
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,720
a woman without children is weak,

326
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,040
and her life is imperfect.

327
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,330
That's not what I was saying.

328
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,130
I know.

329
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,120
I won't take it personally.

330
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,050
Actually,

331
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,720
it's nice to have a kid.

332
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,760
But people like me

333
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
who choose not to have children

334
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,490
and live on their own

335
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,680
are also living

336
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
a good life.

337
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, of course.

338
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,370
Oh, Fangning.

339
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,200
You're pretty bad

340
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,080
with your languages.

341
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,760
"Motherhood is strong."

342
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
That's not how it's supposed to be used.

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,280
Aunt Yazhi.

344
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm here.

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Come, sit.

346
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,410
Aunt,

347
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,320
haven't you been

348
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,280
trying to find a job

349
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,810
and sending out resumes online?

350
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,560
Resumes?

351
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,370
Go ahead. That matters more.

352
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,080
Au... Aunt?

353
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
I'll go send out resumes.

354
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,170
Oh, I forgot to tell you that

355
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,160
Aunt Yazhi divorced,

356
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,170
and her ex-husband got the baby.

357
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,520
Be careful

358
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,360
with your words.

359
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,720
It's tasty.

360
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,730
Mom.

361
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
Come on in, kid.

362
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Come on in.

363
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,530
Close the door.

364
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,250
Come on, come on.

365
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,290
Let me ask you something.

366
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,930
Sit, sit.

367
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,520
Out there, you just said that

368
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,200
you want kids

369
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,320
and then you said you don't.

370
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,090
What exactly were you thinking?

371
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,170
I don't actually

372
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,890
want a child

373
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,040
very, very much.

374
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,810
Besides, mom, you don't

375
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,920
want it that bad either,

376
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,039
do you?

377
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
I didn't say that...

378
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
Of course, I do.

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,730
You just said that

380
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,000
you don't want to take care of the kid.

381
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,160
No.

382
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,519
I was sitting next to Ling Rui,

383
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,400
so I had to say that.

384
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,289
Otherwise, he would

385
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
feel embarrassed.

386
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
Mom.

387
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,809
You might not

388
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,600
gonna be able to have a grandson
so soon.

389
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,320
What do you mean by that?

390
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,000
Since Ling Rui and I got married...

391
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,560
Never mind, it's okay.

392
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
What's going on? What do you mean?

393
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,920
Since you are married, then what?

394
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
We don't act like a couple.

395
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
Not like a couple?

396
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,480
It's exactly like what you're thinking.

397
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,840
There's nothing wrong with my son.

398
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,160
Nothing wrong?

399
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,640
There's nothing wrong.

400
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
Who knows?

401
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,000
A little orange peel.

402
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,160
That's enough.

403
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,970
-Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal won't do.

404
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,440
Don't move, don't talk.

405
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,090
Wolfberry, black sesame,
and green beans.

406
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,000
What is

407
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Ling Rui thinking?

408
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,840
How am I supposed to know
what he's thinking?

409
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,760
Perhaps, he doesn't love Fangning.

410
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,810
What are you talking about?

411
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,850
How could he not

412
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,560
love a girl like Fangning?

413
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,010
Alright, stop talking.

414
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,920
It's already a mess.

415
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,130
Just figure out a way to fix this.

416
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,280
Alright.

417
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,880
Why are you still here?

418
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,130
Why should I leave?

419
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,280
I'll be right where you are.

420
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,320
Where else would I go?

421
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,610
Listen to me,

422
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,560
whatever you're planning

423
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,130
is not gonna work.

424
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
What are you talking about?

425
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,770
What could I possibly have planned?

426
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,810
Of course, I should stay

427
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,160
with my husband.

428
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,890
Right?

429
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,400
Mom, Ling Rui doesn't want to drink it.

430
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Come on, Ling Rui. Drink up.

431
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,160
Drink up.

432
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,290
Drink.

433
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,240
Okay.

434
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,360
Mom, Ling Rui still refuses to drink it.

435
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,160
What's wrong with you, Ling Rui?

436
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,960
Just drink it.

437
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,290
You don't listen to mom now?

438
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,610
You don't listen to your mom now?

439
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,080
Go wash the cup.

440
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,010
Okay.

441
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,040
He drank up.

442
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,410
Come here.

443
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,080
I'll take a shower first.

444
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,800
Okay.

445
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,880
Come here, come here.

446
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,850
Come here.

447
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Later,

448
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
when he's in the shower,

449
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,960
you should just sneak in.

450
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,210
-Shall I do that?
-Don't let him hear you.

451
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,970
I'll lock the door.

452
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,370
No one can see you.

453
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,160
Keep your voice down. Don't talk.

454
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,600
Mom, no.

455
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,440
Stop talking.

456
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
Forget it, forget it.

457
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,120
Be good.

458
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,610
Just get in there.

459
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,710
Turn it off.

460
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,140
Turn it on.

461
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,730
She's shy, you know?

462
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,810
Excuse me.

463
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,690
Go, go, let's go.

464
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,480
I won't be back for a few days.

465
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,280
No way.

466
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,520
My family is going to be suspicious.

467
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I've talked to dad...

468
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,850
I've explained to Uncle Lu that

469
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
I've got something to do at home.

470
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,770
I'll stay here for a few more days.

471
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,990
Alright.

472
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,160
No matter what,

473
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,480
I'll stay with you.

474
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,320
Okay.

475
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,880
You can stay here.

476
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,210
You'll sleep on the floor.

477
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,890
No.

478
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,120
Mom wants us to sleep together.

479
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,650
Also,

480
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,680
don't you forget that
according to the contract,

481
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,250
for the rest of the year,

482
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,430
you have to fulfill every requirement

483
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,130
as my husband.

484
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,410
Then, I suggest that

485
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,790
you should carefully read

486
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,800
the fifth clause in section six

487
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,130
of the contract.

488
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,930
What?

489
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,450
The contract clearly states that

490
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,000
if you, Party A,

491
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,040
coerce me, Party B,

492
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,090
to do anything unethical,

493
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,810
or illegal,

494
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,730
I would have the right
to break the contract

495
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,210
without any legal responsibility.

496
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, I need to add one more.

497
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,970
All the rights and duties

498
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,160
stated in the contract

499
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
have to be done

500
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,650
without violating the law.

501
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,800
I, Lu Fangning, am the general manager

502
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,570
of Deer Sing Group.

503
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,360
Why would I do anything illegal with you?

504
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,240
I'll add this anyway.

505
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,610
Very good.

506
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,720
Well, since you've made up your mind

507
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,000
to do this,

508
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,040
I'll find someone else

509
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,920
to work with me.

510
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,520
Bye.

511
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,570
Lu Fangning.

512
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
You'll be blamed

513
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,090
for marital infidelity.

514
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,450
Half of your money,

515
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,280
your house,

516
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,930
and your favorite Deer Sing

517
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,400
will be mine.

518
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,730
You sleep on the floor.

519
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,440
Comfortable.

520
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,740
[LM Deer Sing Group]

521
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,520
Leader,

522
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,730
do you think it's going to affect

523
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,640
Director Lu's brain waves

524
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,050
and let him adapt your plan

525
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,840
if you keep

526
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
staring at this?

527
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,240
I really don't want
to work overtime anymore.

528
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,970
I'm the one who's working overtime,
not you.

529
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
Look how well I did.

530
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
If he doesn't like this,

531
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
it certainly won't be

532
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
because of my ability.

533
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,000
It would be...

534
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,410
You know, the perfect couple

535
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,240
sometimes starts as enemies.

536
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:40,880
Siyu.

537
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,330
Again.

538
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,510
Siyu.

539
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,250
It's quite good, isn't it?

540
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,770
Left guard.

541
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
Assistant He, what can I do for you?

542
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,890
Director Lu demands

543
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,290
all of us in the Planning Department

544
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,010
to gather at the exhibition center
immediately.

545
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Make sure you bring
all the proposals along.

546
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,160
In our plan,

547
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
we have three days to set up.

548
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,410
But right now,

549
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,690
something came up at the last minute.

550
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,930
There will be no construction
this weekend.

551
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,070
So we're gonna have to

552
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,120
get everything set up

553
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
by end of today.

554
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,920
But, we'll be off work soon.

555
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,650
I don't want to...

556
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,760
Do we need to work overtime again?

557
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,200
Overtime again?

558
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
If you don't want this to happen,

559
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,530
you should have included

560
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,810
a contingency plan

561
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,680
when you were making the proposals.

562
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,760
Do you want the company

563
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,510
to pay for the failure of the plan?

564
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,840
The layout of the exhibition
must be finished today.

565
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Is there any problem with this?

566
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,960
-No problem.
-No problem.

567
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,040
Louder

568
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,640
-No problem.
-No problem.

569
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,650
Once again.

570
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,000
No problem.

571
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:46,880
Alright.

572
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,640
Let's go to work.

573
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
The earlier you get this done,

574
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,470
the longer you get to sleep

575
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,650
after you go home.

576
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,400
And if you all slow down,

577
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,830
you may need to come
to work straight tomorrow.

578
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,160
Let's get started.

579
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,690
He's so determined
and does all the things first.

580
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,230
He's getting more attractive.

581
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,680
Staying here is better.

582
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,120
I dare not even breathe

583
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,290
with Director Lu around.

584
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Director Lu is handsome.

585
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,290
When he's wearing a suit,

586
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,120
he is extremely charming.

587
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,520
Working overtime with him

588
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,730
heals my eyes.

589
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,950
But, Lu Yiyao is too scary.

590
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,680
No one dares speak with him around.

591
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,520
What woman could stand him?

592
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,490
You can.

593
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,040
I think you can.

594
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
-You can.
-You.

595
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,120
I think you might be more efficient

596
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,490
if you just shut up.

597
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,600
Mi.

598
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,050
What's going on with

599
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,960
the labels on these bottles?

600
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
Anything wrong with that?

601
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
Can't you see?

602
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,760
The words are all blurry.

603
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,530
Look at this.

604
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,410
This is the previous batch of labels

605
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,560
that got rejected, right?

606
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,090
We're supposed to use the new one.

607
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,440
As long as the information is correct.

608
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,010
We'll put the new ones on later.

609
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,000
I mean, we're done with all these.

610
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,130
We can't just

611
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,850
do it all over again.

612
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,890
Besides,

613
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,080
it's too late.

614
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,270
No one will notice.

615
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,960
But if these...

616
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,320
My stomach hurts...

617
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,630
I'll bring her to the toilet.

618
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,250
-It hurts so much.
-What do you want to drink, Siyu?

619
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll get you one.

620
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,330
You guys are going to the toilet

621
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,480
or to buy drinks?

622
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,010
Who is it?

623
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,960
Must be him.

624
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,610
At times like this,

625
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,690
the male lead will be here to help.

626
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,130
What are you doing all alone?

627
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,200
I...

628
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,750
This is the distribution of work.

629
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,170
You must strictly follow it.

630
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,110
Do not leave your position
without permission, understand?

631
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,480
Also?

632
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,650
Also,

633
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,440
don't forget the details

634
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
just because the time is running up.

635
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,720
Do everything perfectly.

636
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,490
Have you guys heard me?

637
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,610
Cai Siyu, why did you do that?

638
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,650
We didn't say we weren't gonna do it.

639
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,770
Exactly, what's the point of snitching?

640
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,280
I didn't.

641
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,050
Assistant He.

642
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,360
Whenever a job is done,
cross-check everything

643
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,690
like how you put the labels

644
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,590
on every product.

645
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,920
If you encounter a similar problem again,

646
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
keep me posted.

647
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,640
Okay.

648
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,680
What did you check?

649
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,720
Alright, go ahead.

650
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,490
What did I check?

651
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,610
Let's go.

652
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,320
He not only helped me,

653
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,960
but also got revenge on them,

654
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,930
and tried to keep me out of trouble.

655
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,930
What kind of perfect male lead is this?

656
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,280
I caused trouble
the first three times we met.

657
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,520
I am so sorry.

658
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,090
But without those three accidents,

659
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,240
how could we get to where we are today?

660
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,040
Come and get something to eat.

661
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,720
-Here.
-Hold this for a second.

662
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,760
Come on, come on.

663
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,920
The red ones are beef burgers

664
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
with beef patty and onions.

665
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,320
And this one is the chicken burger

666
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,090
-with fried chicken and tomatoes.
-I like fried chicken.

667
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,330
Siyu, which one do you want?

668
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,370
Can I have both?

669
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,080
I know I can't.

670
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,810
Then I'll have the chicken burger.

671
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,200
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

672
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,120
Director.

673
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,490
We have beef burgers and chicken burgers,

674
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,440
which one do you want?

675
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,320
Beef burger.

676
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,200
Alright.

677
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,920
Hi, this one, without the onions, thanks.

678
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,760
Okay.

679
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,040
What?

680
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,160
There's finally a chance for me?

681
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,440
That's enough.

682
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,530
Give them more.

683
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I thought you didn't eat beef.

684
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,490
Here, chicken burger.

685
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,410
No?

686
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,120
Have a little more.

687
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,970
A little more.

688
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,010
Director Lu.

689
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,680
What's the matter?

690
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,410
Thank you.

691
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,129
For what?

692
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,450
You know, because of the labels,

693
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,800
you've reassigned our jobs.

694
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,160
I was trying to improve

695
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,080
the efficiency.

696
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,609
What's up?

697
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,330
You thought I did it for you?

698
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,600
Is it on again?

699
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,960
Are we

700
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,720
turning into enemies again?

701
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,570
Such a cliche.

702
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,930
Enjoy your meal here.

703
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:47,200
Cai Siyu.

704
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,839
I didn't know

705
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,680
how you convinced Ms. Lu

706
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,200
to let you get into Deer Sing.

707
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,320
But I hope

708
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,450
that you're capable enough

709
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,560
to do your job,

710
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,410
or I'm going to ask you to leave.

711
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,000
See?

712
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
That's usually how it goes.

713
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,600
You won't be willing to let me go later.

714
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,130
Save me in a time of danger.

715
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,050
What a cliche.

716
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,390
But, it's so good.

717
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,570
Are you okay?

718
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,170
This is for you, Director Lu.

719
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,120
No onions.

720
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Ms. Lu.

721
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,610
What are you doing?

722
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,560
Why do you call me here to check on

723
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,440
the exhibition at such a late hour?

724
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,210
Director Lu.

725
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,890
Fangning.

726
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,610
Look.

727
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,960
All the arrangements

728
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
are done already.

729
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
Two days later,
we can launch it on time.

730
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,080
Let's take a look over here.

731
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
Let's go. Mr. Li, come and have a look.

732
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,480
This couch was designed by

733
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,960
Infinity's designer, Gavin.

734
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,130
It's also the main product

735
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,440
of our exhibition then.

736
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,880
During the interview,

737
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,040
we'll have the designer up here

738
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
to receive the interview.

739
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
I think it's all good here.

740
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,280
Why don't we look somewhere else?

741
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,920
Wait a minute.

742
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
I think there's something wrong with

743
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,600
the couch's position.

744
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,810
What do you think, Simon?

745
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,210
Maybe it's the lighting.

746
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,160
I'll tell you what.

747
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,930
Mr. Li.

748
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,410
Why don't you go up there and give it try?

749
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,800
We can get your feedback directly.

750
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,850
It's all good.

751
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,960
Don't make a big deal out of it.

752
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Making furniture

753
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,240
is all about precision.

754
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,090
Besides, this couch really matches

755
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,920
a successful man like Mr. Li.

756
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,090
Give it a try.

757
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,360
Please.

758
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,760
Mr. Li, don't be so nervous.

759
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
You've seen everything.

760
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,690
This couch really matches

761
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,130
you perfectly.

763
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
Turn slightly to the left.

764
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,690
Simon, do you think it's better

765
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,800
for him to face right?

766
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,040
Let's turn right.

767
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,250
Maybe it's the lighting.

768
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,730
Look how pale

769
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,530
Mr. Li's face is.

770
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,090
Mr. Li, sit down. We're not in a hurry.

771
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,650
Director Lu,

772
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,000
even though we don't have much time left,

773
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,960
but we still have to do our best

774
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,000
to make it perfect.

775
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,720
Yes. We have limited time.

776
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,650
Otherwise,

777
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,440
we can do better than this.

778
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,850
The plan was made in advance.

779
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,200
Why did the exhibition hall

780
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,210
suddenly change their mind?

781
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,010
What do you think

782
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,400
about this, Director Lu?

783
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,480
People

784
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,760
are easy to be manipulated.

785
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,240
Ms. Lu, are we done here?

786
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,840
With this light,

787
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,920
my eyes can't take the glare.

788
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
That's enough. Mr. Li, thank you.

789
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,960
What's wrong with this, Lu Fangning?

790
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,000
Right.

791
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,970
What's wrong with this, Simon?

792
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,160
Sorry, Mr. Li.

793
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,570
I forgot to tell you that

794
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,160
this light right here

795
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,570
almost hit

796
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,410
our own staff.

797
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,800
I've checked on it.

798
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,570
Someone did this on purpose.

799
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,360
On purpose?

800
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,130
Thank God Mr. Li sat here in advance,

801
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,850
or it might hit somebody else.

802
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,050
And that's gonna be bad.

803
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,440
Lu Fangning.

804
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,010
Would you like me

805
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,040
to call an ambulance for you?

806
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
No need.

807
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,170
Get me an ambulance when I'm dead.

808
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,600
Let's go.

809
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,160
How absurd.

810
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,440
Ms. Lu, I'll go check over there.

811
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,000
Go ahead.

812
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,520
We're almost done

813
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,360
after the light is fixed.

814
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,000
The rest of the place has been checked.

815
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,530
No signs of tampering.

816
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,400
Don't worry

817
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,400
about the exhibition.

818
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,960
You've done a lot, Simon.

819
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,930
It's alright.

820
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,210
What? In a bad mood?

821
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,000
Why do you say that suddenly?

822
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
I saw you come here

823
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,090
with a long face.

824
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,520
You didn't even argue with him
and just directly went to the point.

825
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,280
Did you fight with Ling Rui?

826
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,170
No, we're fine.

If anything is bothering you,

829
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,250
remember that you still have me.

830
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,800

831
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,810

833
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,920
let it all out,

00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,090
I could do boxing with you.

In short,

836
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
don't keep it all to yourself.

837

It always takes

838
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,120
some experience to grow up.

839
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,600
You told me this.

840
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,050
If I tell you,

841
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,640
you might just

842
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,760
beat the crap out of me.

843
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,650
Hold on, I need to
borrow someone from you.

844
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,760

And with this vibe...
