Ms. Lu Fangning.

Thanks to…

00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,000
Who is she?

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,760
Mrs. Lu.

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
What's happening?

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah.

15
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,970
What's she doing up there?

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280

I'm up here to

of a piece of big news.

21
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,490
Something that will

22
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,600
shock

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920

Lu Fangning and Ling Rui…

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
Hello, everyone.

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
I'm the president of Deer Sing Group.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,600
This is my wife Yang Yi.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,410
As you can see, she is excited.

29
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,160
Well, I'm excited, too, actually.

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,840
Because we've made a last-minute decision

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,810
here today

32
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,250
to announce a piece of

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
great news,

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,279
that is

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,570
my daughter Lu Fangning

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,680
and my son-in-law

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,330
Ling Rui

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
would be the face

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,279
of our new brand Infinity.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,960
Listen to me.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,370
Shouldn't it be Bai Jing?

42
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,840
How did it become our boss?

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Where's Bai Jing?

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I just heard Bai Jing

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,370
mumbling about

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,000
getting paid without having to work

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,960
is so happy.

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,320
He probably heard the news

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,210
and got out of here.

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,930
Their marriage

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,640
is tied to Deer Sing.

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,000
If anything happens today,

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
and the bad news gets around,

55

in your hand right now.

57
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,440
Think about it.

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,760
Calm down.

59
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,960
Alright.

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
I sincerely hope that

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,410
they could get much support from all of you.

62
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,290
Thank you.

63
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,170
And now,

64
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,320
let's get them two up here

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,290
First of all,

68
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,440
we would like to thank you all

we have something that

75

we would like to confess to you.

76
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,240
Don't worry, I'm here.

Actually…

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
My marriage with Ling Rui

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
is a little unusual.

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,840
In the beginning,

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,120
I used a

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,880
certain way

85
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,520
to force him to marry me.

86
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,360
What the hell?

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,580
Didn't they say they were in a relationship?

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,440
Write that down.

[Infinity Product Press Release] [Lu Fangning reveals abnormal beginnings of her marriage]

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800

Write it down quickly.

Our marriage

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
started out a little different.

95
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,050
Because of that,

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
we've taken a few wrong turns, too.

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,440
There's been a lot of misunderstandings.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,250
But we are grateful for

99
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,960
this unusual experience.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
It allowed us to get into each other's lives,

101
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,240
and learn the true meaning of marriage.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,970
Love

103
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
exceeds everything.

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,650
Actually,

105
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,760
the conception of Infinity

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,080
came from something

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,690
that my sister Lu Yue said.

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,640
Giving you infinite meanings

109
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,650
in a finite time.

110
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,120
Therefore,

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope the series of

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Infinity's furniture

113
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
could bring a little bit of

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
difference to

115
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,210
everyone's daily life.

116
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,760
Enjoy the people around you and the love.

117
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Cherish every minute

118
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,280
and every second of every day.

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,960
I also wish the Infinity series

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,359
could be more than furniture.

121
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,040
It could also become

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
an emotional connection

123
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,920
between everyone.

124
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
Just like the meaning

125
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
of Infinity's name.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
In a finite time,

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,450
giving you infinite love.

128
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,770
Thank you.

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,320
Ms. Lu.

130
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,560
Mr. Ling.

131
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,360
Can I get an interview?

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,930
Ms. Lu.

133
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,680
Mr. Ling.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
While this release conference is ongoing,

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,890
there came a few scandals

136
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,800
about your

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,520
marriage situation.

138
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,880
What do you think?

139
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
I think

140
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
it's because I'm

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
just too perfect.

142
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,320
If nobody hates me,

143
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,400
wouldn't it be unfair?

144
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Ms. Lu,

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,680
about the rumor that

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,810
your marriage is a

147
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,720
money transaction,

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,890
what do you think?

149
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,770
Miss reporter, may I ask if

150
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,359
you have someone on your mind

151
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,000
that you really wanted

152
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,160
but you couldn't get?

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,080
Yeah.

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,210
If there's a chance now,

155
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,650
and all you have to give

156
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,240
is your three months' salary.

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,609
For the next year,

158
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,720
you'll be able to

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
enjoy the fact that

160
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
the man you love

161
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
completely belongs to you.

162
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,090
Would you take it?

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,600
Sure.

164
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,360
That's what I thought at first.

165
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,280
And then I found out

166
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,040
it's impossible.

167
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,960
Because love is

168
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,240
cannot be bought with money.

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
But until then,

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
it's okay to dream.

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,480
He means more than just a lover

172
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,920
or a husband to me.

173
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,480
He is also what I'm fighting for,

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,810
and who I make money for.

175
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,840
I want to give

176
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,770
all the best things that I have

177
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,430
to him.

178
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,100
Mr. Ling.

179
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,730
Mr. Ling.

180
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,610
-Mr. Ling, may I ask
-Mr. Ling.

181
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,080
why you didn't say anything?

182
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
What do you think of

183
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,520
the marital relationship

184
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,600
between you and your wife?

185
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,690
Yeah, what's your thought?

186
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,530
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

187
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,090
To me,

188
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,840
she is the best of everything.

189
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,290
Thank you.

190
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
OK. That's good.

191
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,320

197
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
One-year marriage? Money transaction?

198
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,080
Did Ling Rui

199
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
sell himself for four million?

200
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Four million?

201
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,720
My…

202
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,360
My son is

203
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
worth only four million?

204
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Don't ask.

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,280
I love her anyway.

206
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,600
"I love her."

207
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,200
Look at this.

208
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Ling Rui says he loves her.

209
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,890
It's none of my business.

210
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,370
Where are you going?

211
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,610
It's all your fault.

212
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,560
Your fault.

213
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,730
How could you stay out of it?

214
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,010
-I have to punch you.
-Punch you.

215
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,850
-It's all your fault.
-It's all your fault.

216
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,840
I was wrong.

217
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,400
Why did you tell them about

218
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,330
the transaction

219
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,850
at Infinity's release conference?

220
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm just glad I made this choice.

221
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,120
Otherwise,

222
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
all the efforts poured in for Infinity

223
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,520
would be tainted by

224
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,480
my marriage.

225
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
If Ling Rui hadn't tricked you to marry him,

226
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,040
this kind of thing would not

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,080
have happened today.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Simon,

229
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,480
I know I owe you an explanation.

230
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,440
But as I said,

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,690
I took the initiative.

232
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,530
I wanted to do this.

233
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,280
This has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

234
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
Even if the marriage

235
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,720
was your idea,

236
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,010
then what about Tang Ping?

237
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
Is hers also a one-sided love?

238
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
Fangning, don't you see?

239
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
He's lying to you.

240
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,290
In order to make you believe him,

241
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,240
he can pretend to be the kind of guy

242
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,480
that you like.

243
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Simon,

244
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
this is my marriage.

245
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
My relationship with Ling Rui

246
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
is also my personal business.

247
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
I'm trying to protect you, Fangning.

248
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,160
What happened to you?

249
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,490
You've always been

250
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,040
a rational, calm man,

251
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,200
and never suspected

252
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,850
someone else like this

253
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,600
without probable cause.

254
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,530
What's the matter with you, Simon?

255
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,440
What's wrong with me?

256
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
I just…

257
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,090
You both need to calm down.

258
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,770
Simon.

259
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,890
I'm not gonna stop you from caring about Fangning.

260
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,240
I believe that in the end,

261
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,720
you're gonna have

262
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,680
a right judgment

263
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,610
about whether I'm good to her.

264
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,730
Fangning, let's go.

265
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
She's good at what she does.

266
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,880
And even better at finding a husband.

267
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,930
Yes, they confessed, so what?

268
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,880
Their marriage is indeed fake.

269
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
How is it fake?

270
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
The two of them

271
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,480
are truly in love.

272
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,850
What's fake?

273
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,690
Let me tell you.

274
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,880
You just don't want to see Fangning

275
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
live a good life.

276
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,760
You're just jealous.

277
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,320
I…

278
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,730
You put too much faith in them.

279
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,410
Everything she says now sounds good to you.

280
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,440
So is everything she does.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,880
I didn't want you to be fooled.

282
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm telling you.

283
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,640
Everything that Fangning

284
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
does is good.

285
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,770
She is perfect to me.

286
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,520
OK?

287
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Look at yourself.

288
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,160
You went up

289
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,400
to the stage of the press conference.

290
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you know what you looked like?

291
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,680
You're like a shrew!

292
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,970
You're really making me

293
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,480
lose my face.

294
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,690
Do you think that

295
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,440
if you did this,

296
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Fangyu could come back?

297
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,690
Have a think!

298
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Think with your brain.

299
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,210
What are you thinking about?

300
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,170
Why did Fangyu leave?

301
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
It's because Lu Fangning

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,840
was bullying him in the company.

303
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,210
That's why he went dancing.

304
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,520
If he didn't dance,

305
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,130
how could he be abroad

306
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,440
and suffering now?

307
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,450
And you.

308
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:10,960
What?

309
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,720
You let Lu Fangning

310
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,120
bully your son.

311
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
It's your fault.

312
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,810
You and your perfect daughter

313
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,640
drove my son away.

314
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
Lu Fangning bullied him?

315
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,050
And I bullied him?

316
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,410
Come on, he should have the ability to protect himself.

317
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,560
If you care about him so much,

318
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,730
why didn't you go dancing with him?

319
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,920
You two should dance together.

320
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,760
Go dancing.

321
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,920
You're kicking me out?

322
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm not kicking you out.

323
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,880
You just told me to go.

324
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
I didn't.

325
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,170
You sent our son away.

326
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,480
Now you're kicking me out.

327
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm not kicking you out.

328
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,930
You don't want our son,

329
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,880
and you don't want me.

330
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,250
Why is my life so hard?

331
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,370
Psycho.

332
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,480
I married you.

333
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,680
Yet I haven't had a single good day.

334
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,320
I choked down all the bitterness in life.

335
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,200
In the end, you don't want me and my son.

336
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,050
Look at yourself.

337
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,400
You're out there messing around and you're still doing that at home.

338
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,010
Do you really

339
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,320
have to be such a shrew!

340
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,880
All you care about is Lu Fangning,

341
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,210
not me and my son.

342
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Now you want a divorce?

343
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,210
I won't agree with that.

344
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,520
Psycho.

345
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,490
I took the initiative.

346
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,280
I wanted this.

347
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,610
This has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

348
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,560
Even if the marriage

349
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,280
was your idea,

350
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,610
then what about Tang Ping?

351
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,800
Is hers also a one-sided love?

352
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,480
Fangning, don't you see?

353
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,840
He's lying to you.

354
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,600
Simon.

355
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,560
This is my marriage.

356
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
My relationship with Ling Rui

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,570
is also my personal business.

358
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,490
What brings

359
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,680
our tasteful Director Lu

360
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,480
here today?

361
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,170
Why is your super nice

362
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,640
girlfriend

363
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,280
is not here?

364
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,840
Do you like Ling Rui?

365
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,090
It's none of your business.

366
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,840
I can help you.

367
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,480
How is that possible?

368
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,720
Are you nuts?

369
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,730
Of course not.

370
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,890
I can help you get him.

371
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,720
Is today April Fools'?

372
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
Or the end of the world?

373
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Don't trick me.

374
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,760
Tang Ping.

375
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,480
Everything I'm saying right now

376
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,320
is serious.

377
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,640
I want you to tell

378
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,730
Fangning the truth

379
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,160
of how Ling Rui tricked her

380
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,360
and fooled you at the same time

381
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
to get everything he wanted

382
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,850
from you two.

383
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,840
Do you have any idea

384
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,850
what you're talking about?

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,370
Have you read too many novels?

386
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,650
I don't want to be the mean girl here.

387
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,480
Hey,

388
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,400
why are you still defending him?

389
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,250
Or are you trying to cover for him?

390
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,320
I actually want to defend him.

391
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,280
But he doesn't need it.

392
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,520
Dr. Ling.

393
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,120
He is a real streak of

394
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
pure white moonlight.

395
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,200
There's not even one single flaw in him.

396
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,410
That's why I both love and hate him.

397
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,800
You won't understand.

398
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,120
Tell me. Do I look good

399
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,280
in a wedding dress?

400
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,170
Tang Ping.

401
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,920
I was hoping you could

402
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,160
think about

403
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,320
what I just told you.

404
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,280
Bye.

405
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,960
Love you.

406
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,960
Bye.

407
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,039
What's wrong with him?

408
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,120
Evil mother-in-law?

409
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,559
Or the scheming supporting actor?

410
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
Wait.

411
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

412
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,440
What am I panicking about?

413
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,040
Shouldn't he run up

414
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
to me, explain himself,

415
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,600
and do some sweet talking

416
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,680
at times like this?

417
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm walking so slowly.

418
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Why hasn't he caught up?

419
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,930
Didn't he see me?

420
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,480
Siyu.

421
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
Excuse me. One second.

422
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,000
Siyu.

423
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,930
Yes, Director Lu?

424
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm busy.

425
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,640
Let's talk.

426
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
What does Director Lu

427
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
want to talk about?

428
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm sorry.

429
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,160
I shouldn't have lied to you

430
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
about this whole recorder thing.

431
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah.

432
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,840
Yeah.

433
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,090
And?

434
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,200
And?

435
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,280
Yeah.

436
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,410
Now that you've apologized to me,

437
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,840
you're supposed to say you regret it,

438
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
it won't happen again,

439
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,410
and you're gonna put

440
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,450
my feelings first.

441
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,280
I lied to you,

442
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
and that is my fault.

443
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,440
I apologize for that.

444
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
What I did was wrong.

445
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,760
However,

446
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't regret it.

447
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
If I didn't do this,

448
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,850
I wouldn't know the truth about

449
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,330
Fangning and Ling Rui.

450
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,280
And Ling Rui

451
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
is surely up to something.

452
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,170
I don't want Fangning

453
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,240
to fall into his trap like this.

454
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,530
Sorry, Director Lu.

455
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,800
I don't see it the same way you do.

456
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,080
And,

457
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,250
you seem to have forgotten one thing.

458
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
You keep talking about Fangning.

459
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,080
Lu Fangning.

460
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,320
Did you ever think about me?

461
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
Ms. Lu is my friend.

462
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
You made me betray my friend

463
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,200
in a way like this.

464
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,640
Did it ever occur to you

465
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,810
how I'm supposed to face her?

466
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:52,880
Alright.

467
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,240
Even if in your heart,

468
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,370
I'm not in the first place.

469
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,450
But do I have any place there?

470
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,730
I guess I shouldn't have expected

471
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,730
your apology.

472
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,440
[Deer Sing]

473
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,840
Ms. Lu,

474
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,320
the next couple of plans

475
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,120
that we present to you

476
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,850
were all made by

477
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,210
[Shooting Proposal]

478
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,890
the Planning Department

479
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,360
overnight

480
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
for our two

481
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,400
new spokespersons.

482
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,810
The first plan.

483
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,680
Walking down a boardwalk in the mountains.

484
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,450
Man meets nature.

485
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,690
How beautiful is this?

486
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
Back to primitive life.

487
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,610
Getting some fresh air

488
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,040
in these hills.

489
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,440
The second plan.

490
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,600
Walking on the endless highway.

491
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,800
The highway is like

492
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,760
a golden belt

493
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
leading to the perfect place.

494
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,640
Very comfortable.

495
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,120
It fits our theme.

496
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,360
The third plan

497
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,680
is an endless lake.

498
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,000
You can see it's perfectly still.

499
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,080
Just like our brand,

500
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,560
simple, elegant,

501
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
and refreshing.

502
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,280
It calms the mind.

503
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,330
The fourth plan is a small town in Europe.

504
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,080
European towns

505
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,240
combined with

506
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,400
the eastern face of our brand,

507
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,170
the clash of cultures

508
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,090
makes a perfect fit.

509
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,000
The God-chosen place.

510
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,170
Ms. Lu.

511
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,560
These are

512
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
the first four

513
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,360
of our proposals.

514
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
What do you think?

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,320
It's not enough to make a splash.

516
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,200
It's not original enough.

517
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,650
The budget's too high.

518
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,680
Too low for me.

519
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
No problem.

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,520
We still have one last option.

521
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
The urban cultural initiative.

522
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,320
The ones we talked about before

523
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,730
are about combining our brand

524
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,680
with traditional cultures.

525
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,520
But this is different.

526
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,560
This is a

527
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
combination of urban culture.

528
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,960
It's definitely on the cutting edge of fashion.

529
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,360
Besides,

530
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,040
we could use urban culture

531
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,600
to accentuate and elevate

532
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,640
our brand awareness.

533
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,120
Ms. Lu.

534
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,680
This is the last one.

535
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,090
What do you think?

536
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,810
I don't like it.

537
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,290
Ms. Lu.

538
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,480
What do you have in mind?

539
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
You can tell us

540
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,090
about it, too.

541
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
So we can find the right direction.

542
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,440
I think…

543
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,360
I think this thing needs to

544
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,280
leave some empty space

545
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,490
for people to imagine.

546
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,610
We can't be too specific,

547
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,330
or too graphic.

548
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,200
Please go on, Ms. Lu.

549
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,280
I think we can have fewer people in it.

550
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,370
Fewer?

551
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,320
Well, let's make sure

552
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,280
to use scenic or panoramic shots.

553
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,160
The people in the ads

554
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
can only take up

555
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,040
half of the picture.

556
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,560
Fewer.

557
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
One third?

558
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,640
Fewer.

559
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
A quarter of it?

560
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,170
What do you say we use our backs?

561
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

562
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,520
Backs?

563
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
The camera pulls out,

564
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,280
and the two little silhouettes

565
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,130
could just be a profile on the picture.

566
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,440
How's that?

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm gonna go take a pill.

568
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,560
Please don't put his voice in it.

569
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,320
Because Ling Rui's voice

570
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,480
sounds too good.

571
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,770
You've heard it before, right?

572
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,520
Yeah.

573
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,280
We can't let them know

574
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
Ling Rui's job.

575
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,840
What are we gonna do now?

576
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
If it goes like this,

577
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,290
I might actually be on my meds soon.

578
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,630
Dr. Ling.

579
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,470
Dr. Ling.

580
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,440
Help us.

581
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
We've just had

582
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,920
a six-hour meeting.

583
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
And not a single proposal was accepted.

584
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,010
We're going bald from this.

585
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
-What should we do?
-Ask him to come here.

586
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,520
Come here.

587
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,050
Help.

588
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,440
Our boss is so hard to please.

589
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,520
Will he come?

590
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,200
Dr. Ling.

591
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,930
What do you think?

592
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,520
Which would you prefer?

593
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,770
I had a look at these proposals.

594
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,800
They all look pretty good to me.

595
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,720
But in this field,

596
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,450
I'm not a professional.

597
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,760
I'll leave it to you.

598
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,080
Ms. Lu.

599
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,960
Since Dr. Ling said so,

600
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,280
what do you think?

601
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,200
But…

602
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,160
-But...
-But what?

603
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,490
But I've seen

604
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,720
you scheduled this

605
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,360
at the beginning of the next month.

606
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,170
I don't think I'll be available then.

607
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,960
Because this time of year,

608
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,770
I have to go back to my hometown.

609
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,760
You heard that?

610
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Dr. Ling won't be available.

611
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,170
Change the schedule.

612
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,080
But Ms. Lu,

613
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,090
Infinity's products

614
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,280
for the next season

615
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,560
are about to be released to the market.

616
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,090
We can't do without the face of the brand

617
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,210
at the time of

618
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,960
the brand's first big launch, can we?

619
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,330
Go get Bai Jing.

620
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,680
Bai Jing has canceled

621
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
his partnership agreement with Deer Sing.

622
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,640
We've even collected the penalty.

623
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,560
Ask him again.

624
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,280
Ask him to give us a discount.

625
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,720
After all, he got

626
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,450
the first payment.

627
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,600
If…

628
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,520
If you don't mind,

629
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,690
perhaps

630
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,010
we could shoot in my hometown.

631
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
-Yeah, no problem.
-Yeah, no problem.

632
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,970
Ling Rui.

633
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,640
I think that

634
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,840
if you really don't want to,

635
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,210
you don't have to do this.

636
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,090
Actually, these are

637
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,440
not big problems.

638
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,610
I can find someone else to do it.

639
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,720
I know.

640
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
You don't want to intrude on my life.

641
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,160
But since we have

642
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,770
announced it at the press conference.

643
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,810
We have to make it happen.

644
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,130
And plus,

645
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,880
we can shoot at my hometown.

646
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,520
You can do your job,

647
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,280
and I can do mine.

648
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
Isn't that great?

649
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But…

650
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,000
Alright, that's just my opinion.

651
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,160
You can listen to the suggestions

652
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,210
of the Planning Department.

653
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,680
Alright.

654
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,890
Don't you still have a meeting?

655
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,770
Go.

656
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,770
Go.

657
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,960
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

658
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,880
Hello, Simon.

659
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,450
I need to talk to you.

660
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,680
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

661
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,770
What are you doing here?

662
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,130
I'm here for the spokesperson planning meeting.

663
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,400
In a few days,

664
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm gonna take Fangning

665
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,530
to my hometown

666
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
and shoot the commercials.

667
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,450
Oh.

668
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,640
That's what you came here to tell me?

669
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,920
What am I supposed to say?

670
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
Should I say that your place in Fangning's heart

671
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
is unshakable?

672
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,560
No.

673
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm here to remind you that

674
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,680
if you've been hiding

675
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,000
a secret for ten years

676
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,850
just to avoid hurting Fangning,

677
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,690
then why should you

678
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,360
give up now?

679
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,920
What are you talking about?

680
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,080
Lu Yiyao.

681
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,760
You can easily tell

682
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,240
whether I've hurt Fangning or not.

683
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,360
Your hostility towards me

684
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,730
is not because I did something wrong,

685
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,080
but because the man standing

686
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,650
next to Fangning

687
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,440
is me, not you.

688
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm not in a position to judge

689
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,560
you departure ten years ago.

690
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,440
But I thank you

691
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,090
for not letting your feelings

692
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,520
hurt Fangning.

693
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,930
But if you still can't

694
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,000
let go by now,

695
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,560
it'll only make Fangning feel bad.

696
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
How do you know all this stuff?

697
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
A man like you

698
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,450
who has been hiding your feelings for ten years

699
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,480
and knew how important that

700
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,760
the conference was to Fangning,

701
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,560
still chose to expose everything

702
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,440
at that time.

703
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,490
This means you've lost your mind,

704
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,880
and you can't control your emotions.

705
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,640
Do you think that

706
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
Fangning can't

707
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
see through all of this?

708
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,560
I'll take Fangning

709
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,640
away for a while.

710
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,690
In the meantime, I'd appreciate

711
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,240
it if you could get your emotions together.

712
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
What makes you think

713
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,640
you have the right to tell me this?

714
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,800
Because I can

715
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,930
love her fair and square.

716
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,280
That's all I've got.

717
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,120
Besides,

718
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,400
Fangning is not someone

719
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,170
who needs others' protection.

720
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,440
What she needs is someone to

721
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
stand next to her.

722
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,450
And now,

723
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,810
I'll stand by her side.

[Wheatfields represent hope]

725
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,160
Ms. Lu.

726
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,600
This is my special proposal

727
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
which is customized

728

[Lake shows endlessness]

729
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
just for you and Dr. Ling.

730
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
How's it?

731
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,970
Are you sure that

732
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,600
this is Ling Rui's hometown?

733
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,690
Yes, of course.

734
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,240
I got these off the Internet.

735
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,760
The picturesque scenery.

736
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,840
Full of nature's spirit.

737
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
And completely undeveloped.

738
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,080
Just right for Infinity.

739
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,880
What a pleasant surprise.

740
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,640
So,

741
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,360
I highly recommend you and Dr. Ling

742
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,400
to have your

743
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
honeymoon here.

744
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,120
And just take some pictures

745
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,490
during your spare time.

746
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,920
What do you think, Ms. Lu?

747
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
Ms. Lu.

748
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,960
This is shooting three birds with one arrow.

749
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,000
Honeymoon.

750
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,410
Shooting commercials.

751
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
And taking Dr. Ling down

753
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,040
Take him down

754
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,280
completely?

755
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
It's exactly what you are thinking.

756
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:53,930
Think about it.

757
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,480
In a secluded farming town,

758
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,330
away from the buzz of the city,

759
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,920
in the golden fields of wheat,

760
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,810
the wind carries the waves of wheat.

761
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,450
Waves.

762
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
It's so romantic.

763
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm talking about the shooting.

764
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
It's all for work.

765
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,400
And of course,

766
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,800
it's also for Ms. Lu's

767
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,250
personal happiness.

768
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,360
Then it's settled.

769
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,730
You and Dr. Ling go ahead first.

770
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,120
We'll work out the plan at the company.

771
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
And we'll be there in a few days

772
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
so that you and Dr. Ling

773
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,960
could complete the final step.

774
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,560
All right, go ahead.

775
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,240
All right.

776
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,890
Wave.

777
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,050
Wave.

778
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,880
Wave.

779
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Wave.

780
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,720
You knew how important that conference

781
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,890
was to Fangning,

782
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,000
and still chose to

783
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,010
expose everything at that time.

784
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,530
It means you've lost your mind,

785
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
and you can't control your emotions.

786
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,560
Fangning is not someone

787
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,920
who needs others' protection.

788
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,600
What she needs is

789
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
someone to

790
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
stand next to her.

791
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,890
And now,

792
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,280
I will stand by her side.

793
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,000
Is this the ending?

794
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,730
What a bad ending.

795
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,080
No way.

796
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,240
Even if I'll die, I have to know the truth.

797
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,350
Simon.

798
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,120
Simon.

799
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,220
Simon.

800
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,230
You've got a call.

801
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:02,680
Hello.

802
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,360
Hello.

803
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,080
Lu Yiyao

804
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,250
got drunk at the Alleyway Bar.

805
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,930
If you're his friend,

806
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,280
can you come and get him?

807
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,330
Okay.

808
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,410
Lu Yiyao.

809
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,880
Lu Yiyao.

810
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,250
Lu Yiyao.

811
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,600
Naughty.

812
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,760
Are you really drunk?

813
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,330
Well, is this the time when

814
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,680
you tell the truth while you're drunk?

815
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,690
Lu Yiyao.

816
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,610
What's your bank account password?

817
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,240
Password?

818
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,960
35768024.

819
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,360
What kind of password is this? It's so long.

820
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,080
Lu Yiyao.

821
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,280
So who's your favorite person?

822
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,880
Do they have a long name too?

823
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,800
Don't bother.

824
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,680
I mean, he's this drunk.

825
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,960
He should be asleep by now.

826
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,160
Young lady,

827
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,360
now that you're here,

828
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,330
I'm gonna have to ask you

829
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,280
to pay the bill for him.

830
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,650
We don't accept credit

831
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,680
even from my best customers.

832
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
-This…
-Excuse me.

833
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,040
Do I look like that kind of

834
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,210
naive and stupid girl?

835
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,840
I can't get anything out of him.

836
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,800
And I have to pay for you!

837
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,040
Pay?

838
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,760
Who's paying?

839
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
I got money.

840
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,040
Money.

841
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,240
I thought you said you don't use a wallet.

842
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
Why are you so tall?

843
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,400
I can't even get a picture of you.

844
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,240
You stay down, stay down.

845
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,360
What are you doing?

846
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,160
Just squat down.

847
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
Alright.

848
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,690
How about we use this picture

849
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,570
as our lock screen wallpaper?

850
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,280
What do you say?

851
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,160
No, we're in a secret relationship.

852
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,410
This is too public.

853
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,320
Well, why don't we

854
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
put it in our wallets?

855
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,640
Every time you open it,

856
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,480
you'll see me.

857
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,360
Isn't that wonderful?

858
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,640
But I don't really use a wallet.

859
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,440
Every time you open it,

860
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,520
you'll see the one you love.

861
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,000
Cai Siyu.

862
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,720
Director Lu.

863
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,490
Let's have dinner after work.

864
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,360
Cai Siyu.

865
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,010
When did you and Simon

866
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,490
get close enough to have dinner together?

867
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:16,680
That's right.

868
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,610
When?

869
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,440
If I didn't do this,

870
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,880
I wouldn't know the truth about it.

871
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,360
Fangning and Ling Rui.

872
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,690
And Ling Rui surely

873
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,930
is up to something.

874
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,880
I don't want Fangning

875
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
to walk into a trap like this.

876
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,040
Hello.

877
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,240
Simon.

878
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,640
The girl who paid for you

879
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,400
left your wallet

880
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,530
here at the bar.

881
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,320
Come and get it when you're free.

882
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,090
OK.

883
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:40,920
Director Lu.

884
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,320
Hi, Director Lu.

885
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,770
Lin Qi was here just now.

886
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,560
There're some new kittens at the pet store.

887
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,370
Let's check it out after work.

888
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,040
Here you are.

889
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,360
Look, this kitten is new here.

890
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,120
Isn't it cute?

891
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,840
Last time I brought you here

892
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,490
I noticed that you liked kittens.

893
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:54,880
What do you say?

894
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,290
Do you want one?

895
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,210
Siyu.

896
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,080
You don't like this one?

897
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,400
Then how about that one?

898
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,880
That one's cute, too.

899
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,210
Siyu.

900
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,360
What are you doing?

901
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm picking out a kitten for you.

902
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,040
You look cold

903
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,960
and stressed every day.

904
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,000
Having a cat helps prevent depression.

905
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Most important of all,

906
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,080
it could accompany you.

907
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,640
I don't need it.

908
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,040
No problem.

909
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,480
I can think of something else.

910
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,250
You know all about it?

911
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,810
What do I know?

912
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

913
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,400
Since you don't want a pet.

914
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,370
Well, let's…

915
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,760
Let's go to watch a movie.

916
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,360
OK?

917
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,520
Let's just break up.

918
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,680
I'm sorry.

919
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,130
Lu Yiyao.

920
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,810
Lu Yiyao, wait.

921
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,570
Yes, I know.

922
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,600
So what?

923
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,920
I don't care.

924
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,800
Just pretend that I don't know anything.

925
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,400
OK?

926
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,920
Why are you doing this?

927
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,890
Because I found out that

928
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,600
I like you more than I thought.

929
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,760
I don't care about anything else.

930
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,080
Can't I just continue to

931
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,210
be your girlfriend?

932
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,530
You know I don't like you,

933
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,410
and you still want to be my girlfriend?

934
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,200
Are you stupid?

935
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,530
Perhaps if you give it some time,

936
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,520
we could have another try

937
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,120
and you might like me.

938
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,040
Other than 'love at first sight',

939
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,970
and 'quarrelsome lovers',

940
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,120
there're also people who fall in love

941
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,440
after spending some time together.

942
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,170
That's impossible.

943
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,120
I'm not gonna like you.

944
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,560
I think we're done here.

945
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,640
I said I don't care.

946
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,050
I just don't care!
