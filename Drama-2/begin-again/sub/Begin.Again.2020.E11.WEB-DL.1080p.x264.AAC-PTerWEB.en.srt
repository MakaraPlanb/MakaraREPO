[Begin Again]

3
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,190
Don't catch a cold.

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,440
To be honest,

6
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,200
this is much better.

7
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,080
Are you not going to sleep?

8
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,510
I'm in so much pain,

9
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,750
how can I fall asleep?

10
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,870
How are you supposed to fall asleep

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,150
when you are looking at me like that?

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,560
How about...

13
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,390
you sing to me?

14
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,230
Okay?

15
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,430
You're not a kid anymore.

16
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,400
Why do you need others to sing to you?

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,590
Since you like kids so much,

18
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,040
you're surely good at singing

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,080
children's songs,

20
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,760
lullaby or something like that.

21
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,710
Just sing a few lines.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
I don't sing.

23
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,470
Just a few lines, come on.

24
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,950
I don't sing.

25
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,120
Sleep now.

26
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,200
Then you must sing out of tune.

27
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,240
Fine,

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,390
I won't put you on the spot.

29
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,880
Read me a book, then?

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,029
There's one beside you,

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,510
the one on the top.

32
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,510
Read it to me,

33
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,270
I'm sure I'll fall asleep soon.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,520
That's where I stopped.

35
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,029
The upbringing of a newborn.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,480
Go ahead.

37
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,110
Lu Fangning,

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,750
why do you

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,070
want a kid so much?

40
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,870
Right.

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,350
Why?

42
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,430
Kids...

43
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,470
are troublesome

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,750
and annoying.

45
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,750
But,

46
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,150
I don't know.

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,510
Maybe it's because

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,880
I've lived alone for so long.

49
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,590
Sometimes, I think that

50
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,600
if I come back to an empty house

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
and there's a kid

52
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,600
with snot and tears on his face,

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,030
crying and shouting,

54
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,710
"Mom, Mom".

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,469
Life would be pretty interesting.

56
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,950
If you are not reading to me,

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
can I sleep in your arms?

58
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll be asleep in a minute

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,350
with your smell.

60
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,680
It hurts suddenly.

61
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,520
Holding my arm works, too.

62
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,320
Fine if you don't want to.

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not picky.

64
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,790
Just sleep.

65
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,600
Why do you

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
want a kid so much?

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,270
Maybe it's because

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,640
I've lived alone for so long.

69
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,440
Sometimes, I think that

70
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,630
if I come back to an empty house

71
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,350
and there's a kid

72
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,310
with snot and tears over his face,

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,790
crying and shouting,

74
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,430
"Mom, Mom".

75
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,230
Life would be pretty interesting.

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,550
Life is full of obstacles.

77
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,430
It was such a great opportunity.

78
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,800
He even hugged me.

79
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,430
The atmosphere was just right.

80
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,000
I could at least try,

81
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,390
but my period came.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,710
Morning.

83
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,550
Morning.

84
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,640
I made you breakfast.

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
Help yourself.

86
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,350
Thank you.

87
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Well...

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,470
You don't have to watch me eat.

89
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,110
You can go to work.

90
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,830
It'll take me a long time to finish.

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,040
After you finished your breakfast,

92
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,200
I'd like to talk to you about something.

93
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,550
All right, I'm not going to eat.

94
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,070
Go ahead, you're going to say it anyway.

95
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,830
In any case,

96
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
I won't agree if it's about

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,000
getting a divorce or breaking up.

98
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,840
Back then,

99
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,920
-the thing failed...
-Sorry.

100
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,040
Why...

101
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,670
Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?

102
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,950
Back when

103
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,120
we were in the amusement park,

104
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,750
I actually had a good time.

105
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,470
However, this happiness

106
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,110
came from something wrong,

107
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,760
so I got angry with you.

108
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
If you hadn't told me, I didn't even know

110
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
you were angry.

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,470
You can be angry.

112
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,680
You can tell me off.

113
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm not that vulnerable.

114
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,390
Besides,

115
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,680
I've thought it through.

116
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,510
I shouldn't have judged you arbitrarily that

117
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,880
you were not qualified to have a child.

118
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,509
Maybe you're more suitable than anyone else

119
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,629
to have a child

120
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,960
and be a good mother.

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,670
But that's not

122
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,910
in my life plan.

123
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,710
The shooting stars are splendid,

124
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,720
but they do not last long.

125
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,710
If that's what you're really

126
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,750
getting married for,

127
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,270
I don't think I am

128
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,390
the right person.

129
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,270
So,

130
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
I think it would be better for us

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
to call off the engagement.

132
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,830
I'm willing to bear

133
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,150
all of the consequences.

134
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,440
I disagree.

135
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,950
What if I insist?

136
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,270
I don't want a baby.

137
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,200
You don't have to do this.

138
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,390
I know what I'm saying now

139
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,430
will make you think I'm lying to you.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,910
But to tell you the truth,

141
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,590
I didn't marry you

142
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,160
just because I want a kid.

143
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
I also want to promote

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Infinity.

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,990
Now, the brand

146
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,680
is not officially launched yet.

147
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,230
If we got divorced,

148
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,040
Lu Wenbin will not

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,790
let me off,

150
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,630
let alone the others.

151
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,920
Keeping me from making money,

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,400
that's the worst thing ever.

153
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,510
Besides,

154
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,920
I can have a baby after a year.

155
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,390
My previous behaviors

156
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,640
have caused you trouble,

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,750
Starting from today,

159
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,670
we'll formally continue

160
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,910
our relationship within the contract.

161
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,790
By the way,

162
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,310
remember to come home early tonight.

163
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,640
Don't let them get suspicious.

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,710
I got him, right?

165
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,350
He must have bought my words.

166
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,710
I pretended to be so pure-hearted.

167
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,350
Right. Just make him stay for now.

168
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,560
Lu Fangning, you did a great job.

169
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,630
You acted well.

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,110
As long as he stays,

171
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,920
you'll definitely get to have a baby.

172
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,710
Money will come as well.

173
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,790
Ling Rui,

174
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,600
you can't get away.

175
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,160
[Medically speaking,]

176
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,070
[dolls bring a sense of security]

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,190
[and ease loneliness.]

178
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,390
[Let it stay with you.]

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,870
[I went to work.]

180
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,150
[See you at home tonight.]

181
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,470
To ease loneliness

182
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,760
and bring a sense of security?

183
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
What's the point of having a bear doll?

184
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,280
I need to order an adult edition.

185
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
Let me see.

186
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,840
Pingping,

187
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,990
what's wrong?

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm heartbroken.

189
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,870
You drank all of these?

190
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,760
The pool.

191
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,990
You...

192
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,390
This could bring out the mood.

193
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,200
Dad,

194
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm heartbroken.

195
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,590
I feel so terrible.

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,790
How about this?

197
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,830
Think about it.

198
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,910
How are you

199
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,590
better than Fangning?

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,630
Let's turn the feeling of heartbreak

201
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,520
into motivation for life.

202
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,320
How's that?

203
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,390
Better than Lu Fangning?

204
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,190
Yes.

205
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,400
For example,

206
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,200
work,

207
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,080
studies,

208
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,320
hobbies,

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,990
and...

210
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,390
It seems like there's nothing

211
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,750
you can compare with her.

212
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,150
Dad!

213
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,550
Okay, okay.

214
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,590
It's my bad.

215
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,070
I was wrong. I...

216
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,310
It's my fault.

217
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,880
Pingping.

218
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,150
Pingping.

219
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,630
Dad,

220
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,200
I want to learn to dance.

221
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,240
Good, maintain your posture.

222
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,630
Raise your hands steadily.

223
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,560
Yazhi,

224
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,750
I thought you have enjoyed

225
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,400
your ballet classes with us.

226
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
With your own experience,

227
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,230
you may be able to attract more students.

228
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,120
That's why I agreed

229
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,510
to hire you

230
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,550
as our course consultant.

231
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,670
But for the past few days, your...

232
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,360
your attire...

233
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,360
This is genuine.

234
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,560
It's from my nephew's wife.

235
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,480
She's particularly wealthy.

236
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,630
It's not fake.

237
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,870
That's the problem.

238
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,990
Think about this.

239
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,630
When people come to us for inquiries

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,910
and they saw you dressed up

241
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,110
in luxury brands.

242
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,590
They may think that

243
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,670
we overcharge our students.

244
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,230
Look.

245
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,990
Up until now,

246
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,070
you haven't closed a deal yet, have you?

247
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
Headmaster,

248
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,470
I don't think

249
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,640
this is about my attire.

250
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,150
Hi.

251
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,190
Hi, I'd like to ask about

252
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,600
the dance lessons here.

253
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:34,950
Okay.

254
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,150
-I'll get back to work.
-Please wait a moment.

255
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,470
Hi, there.

256
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,910
I'm the course consultant here.

257
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,470
Which courses

258
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,390
would you like to know more about?

259
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,750
Miss,

260
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,350
you look very familiar.

261
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,630
Have we met somewhere before?

262
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,950
It's...

263
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,310
Are you a fan of mine?

264
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,720
I'll give you my autograph later.

265
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
You're a celebrity?

266
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,350
She's a celebrity.

267
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
No, not yet.

268
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,950
I'm just a little famous.

269
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,710
Your dress...

270
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,680
The latest collection.

271
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,360
It's authentic.

272
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,310
But it... Well...

273
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,720
It had a discount.

274
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,870
I choose here.

275
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,350
You'd like to register for a membership?

276
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,990
Even a saleswoman

277
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,600
wears famous brands from top to toe.

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,230
That means this is a high-class institution

279
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,600
with a good taste.

280
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It's just right for me.

281
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Ms. Tang,

282
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,430
we have various

283
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,440
kinds of courses here.

284
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,590
Ballroom dancing,

285
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,360
samba,

286
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,070
rumba,

287
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,310
Latin dance,

288
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,190
ballet, belly dance...

289
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,880
I want the one that

290
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,950
looks particularly elegant,

291
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,320
graceful

292
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,750
and difficult.

293
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,230
The kind that few people can learn.

294
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,510
You don't have it here?

295
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,750
Ballet?

296
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,270
Ballet?

297
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,670
The most expensive class.

298
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,990
I see.

299
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,000
You must think that

300
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,910
I have long hands and feet.

301
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,830
Even my neck as well.

302
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,230
Just like a graceful white swan.

303
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,240
Am I right?

304
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,200
That's what my dad always says about me.

305
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,150
Yes, yes, Ms. Tang.

306
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,029
Don't call me Ms. Tang.

307
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,110
Too polite.

308
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,080
Can I call you

309
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,230
Tangtang?

310
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,150
Tangtang instead of Pingping.

311
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,160
I like you so much.

312
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,840
What's your name?

313
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,910
My surname is Ling.

314
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,269
Ling?

315
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,600
I like you more now.

316
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,120
Ms. Tang, no, Tangtang.

317
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,990
You're making me feel shy.

318
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,950
We have a times card,

319
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,400
monthly card, quarterly card, and annual card.

320
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,310
VIP cards as well.

321
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,920
Would you like to

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
go for a trial class first?

323
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,200
Just get me an annual card.

324
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,390
The VIP card, the most expensive one.

325
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,510
I like you, too!

326
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,040
Me too!

327
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,110
By the way,

328
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,790
I've asked the Design Dept to

329
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,630
try to adjust

330
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,110
the production technique of the main series.

331
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,150
The outcome should be out

332
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,120
in a few days.

333
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,240
All right.

334
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,190
I have an appointment.

335
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,520
You may go first.

336
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,310
Don't drink too much.

337
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
What are you looking at?

338
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,110
Nothing.

339
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,270
How is the partnership

340
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,670
between Ms. Qin and Deer Sing?

341
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,680
I'll take care of that.

342
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,150
I'm busy. I have to go now.

343
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,910
[Who would dare touch his woman?]

344
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,110
What is making you so happy?

345
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
The company's financial statements.

346
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,440
Earlier on,

347
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
I ran into Simon downstairs.

348
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,390
He came back with me.

349
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,720
He's busy so he left.

350
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,190
By the way,

351
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,440
Ms. Qin said that

352
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,230
she and Lu Yiyao went on a blind date.

353
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,200
You were there as well.

354
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,950
Why did you ask?

355
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,440
Nothing, I'm curious.

356
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,550
How should I put it?

357
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,880
It's not like I was there

358
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,430
when they went on a blind date.

359
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,430
To be precise,

360
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,400
I was present

361
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,910
when Simon went on

362
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,920
all of his blind dates.

363
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,840
I was still young at that time.

364
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,390
My dad was busy with his business.

365
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,670
He left me with my uncle.

366
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,600
But my uncle

367
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
was not any older than me.

368
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,990
He was busy with his company

369
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,070
and he had to take care of me.

370
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,160
He had no time to date

371
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,840
so he had to go to these blind dates.

372
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,750
If I hadn't helped him

373
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,040
deal with those girls

374
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,190
on his blind dates,

375
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,590
Simon would have

376
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,240
suffered a lot more.

377
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,190
He really listens to you.

378
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
How do I put it?

379
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Sometimes,

380
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
only a woman

381
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,670
can see a woman better.

382
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,670
If I don't like the girl,

383
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,990
Simon won't like her, either.

384
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,270
What about you?

385
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,590
Do you like him?

386
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,070
Of course.

387
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,440
I prefer the way Simon looks after me

388
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,630
than that of my dad.

389
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,120
Back then,

390
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,430
he even took me to have a drink.

391
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,630
I think...

392
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,830
What's the matter?

393
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,710
I think we've lived here

394
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,080
long enough.

395
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,110
Let's move back to the apartment tomorrow.

396
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,550
It's kind of like

397
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,680
resuming our contract.

398
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
A new start.

399
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,680
Really?

400
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,230
You don't want to?

401
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,390
I...

402
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,630
I don't mind

403
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,840
if we are moving or not.

404
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,390
Well then...

405
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,830
Okay. Let's do that.

406
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
I'll pack my stuff

407
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,150
and tell my dad about it.

408
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
Newlyweds.

409
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,240
Only us two.

410
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,400
Should I see them off?

411
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,320
Should I not?

412
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,590
I should.

413
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,230
Why can't they stay here?

414
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,350
If you live here, I'll feed you

415
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,630
and you don't have to pay the rent.

416
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,110
Did we bother both of you?

417
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,630
I should not.

418
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,520
I should.

419
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Should not.

420
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,400
It's a good idea for you to go back there.

421
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,230
It's more convenient for you two.

422
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,870
Hurry up.

423
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,710
I'll be waiting for your good news.

424
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,590
Thank you, Aunt Yang. I hope the same, too.

425
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,840
Well...

426
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,680
Where's Mr. Lu?

427
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,560
Where's your dad?

428
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,910
How would I know?

429
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
I'll check on him.

430
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,710
Take care.

431
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,520
Okay.

432
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,790
Come back and eat with us sometimes.

433
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,990
Fangning,

434
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,430
remember to come home more often.

435
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
Fangning,

436
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,670
take care of yourself.

437
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't worry.

438
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,350
I had been living alone

439
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,590
over the years.

440
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,040
And now she has me.

441
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,800
I'll take good care of Fangning.

442
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,510
Where's she?

443
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,390
-What?
-Where's she?

444
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,230
Fangning?

445
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,350
She left a while ago.

446
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,550
They left?

447
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,310
What a nice weather.

448
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,910
Aunt Gao,

449
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,430
please get the quilts to air them out.

450
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,360
Wait, wait.

451
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,800
Wait.

452
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,550
Am I that unreasonable?

453
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,550
No, no.

454
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
The old saying is right.

455
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,560
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

456
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,350
If you insist on keeping her,

457
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,230
she'll come to hate you.

458
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,710
That's right.

459
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,200
Go in. What are you thinking about?

460
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,750
"The CEO and Her Doctor."

461
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,430
A sweet holiday.

462
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,990
It's just a book title.

463
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,070
My recent hobby.

464
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,270
It was an unintentional situation

465
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,670
the last few times

466
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,750
you came to my house.

467
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,680
My house is usually

468
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
this clean and tidy.

469
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,080
I cleaned it the day before yesterday.

470
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,310
Really?

471
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,920
When you came the day before yesterday,

472
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,400
don't you think that

473
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,000
there was not much cleaning to be done?

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,430
It was pretty much the same as now, right?

475
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,840
I'll put the luggage away.

476
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,800
What are you doing?

477
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,110
Are you really sleeping in the guest room?

478
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,560
Where else then?

479
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,190
No.

480
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,560
If we have guests

481
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
visiting our home,

482
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,750
they'll find out.

483
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,960
Do you have many guests?

484
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,190
Not that many.

485
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,070
If we do have guests coming over,

486
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,590
we can just tidy up the place.

487
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,360
My work schedule

488
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,400
is different from your schedule.

489
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,630
We shouldn't disturb each other

490
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,070
so that you can sleep better.

491
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,750
I'd like to be disturbed by you.

492
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
What are you doing?

493
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,670
I'm putting my luggage in.

494
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,480
You...

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,030
Put it somewhere else.

496
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,560
Why?

497
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,430
No reason.

498
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,920
Is there anything in here?

499
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,350
Nothing.

500
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,640
Why can't I put it in?

501
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,960
You can't keep stopping me.

502
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,310
Where else can I put it?

503
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,790
You...

504
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,320
Do you really want to open it?

505
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Yes.

506
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,800
Are you sure?

507
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,520
Okay.

508
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
Open it if you want.

509
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,720
I've warned you.

510
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,510
You insisted.

511
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,440
He looks so good even when he folds clothes.

512
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,560
It's okay for us to sleep in separate rooms.

513
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,950
We're married.

514
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,120
It's just a matter of time.

515
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,680
Are you done?

516
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,000
Let's do some grocery shopping

517
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,150
in the supermarket later.

518
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,920
It's because...

519
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,680
It had always been just me

520
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,830
in this house.

521
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,960
So I only prepared the daily necessities

522
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,950
for myself.

523
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
This is kind of like our new home.

524
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Why don't we replace them with new ones?

525
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,670
Fangning,

526
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,120
I have something to tell you.

527
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,590
What's the matter?

528
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,430
From now on, the living expenses,

529
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,440
management fees,

530
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,520
utility bills,

531
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
and the cost of hiring a helper...

532
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,440
This house is mine.

533
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,960
You don't have to worry about that.

534
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,030
Didn't you say

535
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,190
it's our new home?

536
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,510
Although our marriage is a contract,

537
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,670
the marriage certificate is real.

538
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,750
And we're living together.

539
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,750
Even housemates who live together

540
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,390
share the expenses as well.

541
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,160
Not to mention that

542
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,040
I need to carry out my responsibility

543
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,680
as a good husband.

544
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,000
So in the future,

545
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,430
I'll pay these expenses on time every month.

546
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,040
I can't believe

547
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,430
I'm being financially supported.

548
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,160
Thank you.

549
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,080
I know that it sounds like

550
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,990
I'm overestimating myself,

551
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,400
you don't lack money.

552
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,440
What's wrong with that?

553
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,030
Someone wants to support me.

554
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,960
That's great.

555
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,080
Besides, you're my husband.

556
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,160
Enough,

557
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,070
let's go.

558
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
Let's go out.

559
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,680
There's one more thing.

560
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll go on a business trip tomorrow.

561
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,720
Business trip?

562
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,310
Where are you going?

563
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,040
I mean...

564
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,150
You just got married.

565
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,200
Why would you go on a business trip?

566
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,830
Okay...

567
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,080
A business trip.

568
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,360
It's your job.

569
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,950
I can understand that.

570
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,720
I can take care of myself.

571
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,070
For how long?

572
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,950
Just a short trip.

573
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,840
Just three days.

574
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,680
Three days?

575
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,510
Three days is fine.

576
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Just three days.

577
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,640
You may go.

578
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,470
[After three days,]

579
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,480
[you'll be mine.]

580
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,720
You could have just left.

581
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,040
Why bother

582
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
with these things?

583
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,030
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

584
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,190
When you're in a bad mood,

585
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,640
drink some milk.

586
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,000
Tyrosine can help ease your mood.

587
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,390
Didn't you go to the airport?

588
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,840
When I got to the airport,

589
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,400
I found out that I forgot
to remind you to drink milk

590
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,510
and I was worried you wouldn't have breakfast.

591
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,430
So I brought it to you.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,640

595
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,240
How can you imagine

596
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,880
such a shameful scene?

597
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,630
Be calm.

598
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,510
Ms. Lu.

599
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,880
Tomorrow's meeting with Mr. Zhang.

600
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,870
I'll cancel it.

601
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,750
Cancel it first.

602
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,400
Okay.

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,190
♫ Even the pedestrians look like him ♫

604
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,400
It's getting worse.

605
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,840
Why is he in the office

606
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,150
folding clothes?

607
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,080
It turns out that I also like it

608
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,720

Ms. Lu.

612
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,840
Ms. Lu.

613
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,430
Ms. Lu.

614
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,870
I can't think of him anymore.

615
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,350
I need to immerse myself in work.

616
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,880
Let's go.

617
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,200
To the mall.

618
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,070
Now?

619
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,720
[Deer Sing Group]

620
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,040
Slow down. I'm off today.

621
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,920
I know you're having a day off today.

622
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,400
That's why I asked you to tag along.

623
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,040
Or who will help me

624
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,840
after I bought all of the furniture?

625
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,030
Remember this.

626
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
Respect your teacher.

627
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,590
Don't just say it.

628
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,360
Okay, okay.

629
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,270
Put it into action.

630
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,990
Mr. Yu,

631
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,000
there are so many furniture malls in the city.

632
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,830
Why did you choose to come here?

633
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,070
In our city,

634
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,840
this is the largest, most luxurious mall

635
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,480
with the most complete collections.

636
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,830
Why shouldn't I come here?

637
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,920
Are you trying to

638
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,070
take advantage of Ling Rui?

639
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,280
What are you talking about?

640
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,510
Even if his wife runs a furniture company,

641
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,520
It's impossible that

642
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,000
she owns the whole mall.

643
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
How else could it be?

644
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,080
She does own the whole mall.

645
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,430
I've already seen through

646
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,600
your thoughts.

647
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,750
Aren't I smart?

648
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,760
No wonder she was so assertive

649
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,200
in the reunion that day.

650
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,710
So she is really wealthy.

651
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,400
It wasn't just for show?

652
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,320
Of course not.

653
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,990
She's so rich,

654
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,190
how does she treat Ling Rui?

655
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,750
Will she bully him?

656
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
I heard about it on the news...

657
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,430
Mr. Yu, wait.

658
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,350
Rich people are all...

659
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,440
If you love reading this gossips so much,

660
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
just ask her.

661
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,120
Fangning.

662
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,030
Well... This is Mr. Yu,

663
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,270
Ling Rui's class teacher.

664
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,710
-Hi, Mr. Yu.
-Nice to meet you.

665
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,720
Well, you and Ling Rui...

666
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,520
Don't mention him.

667
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,630
No, I... I mean

668
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,680
I'm working.

669
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,120
My relationship with him is private.

670
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,430
Work makes me happy.

671
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,670
Enjoy yourself here.

672
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,230
See you, Mr. Yu.

673
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,560
Why did she act like that

674
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,640
when I mentioned Ling Rui?

675
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,590
Ling Rui is on a business trip.

676
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,360
Did they argue?

677
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,400
Fangning! Fangning.

678
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,990
Lu.

679
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,350
Mr. Yu, Peng Bo.

680
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,990
I wonder

681
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,400
what do you want to talk to me about?

682
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,550
Here is the thing...

683
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,520
Today,

684
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,110
I came here to shop around.

685
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,430
At the same time,

686
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,630
I would also like to know

687
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,350
how is my student doing.

688
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,430
Ling...

689
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,270
After the reunion that day,

690
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,670
did he get angry?

691
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,160
Mr. Yu.

692
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,400
Aren't you Ling Rui's

693
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,710
most valued teacher?

694
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,070
You should know him well.

695
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,470
How would he be angry?

696
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,710
He said that,

697
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,560
"These...

698
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,790
are all part of my life,

699
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
I don't need to avoid them."

700
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,669
Didn't he say anything else?

701
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,480
Lu.

702
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,240
Ling Rui is good in every way,

703
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,750
except for one thing.

704
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,470
He is softhearted,

705
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,710
quiet,

706
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
and way too sensible.

707
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,310
He keeps everything to himself.

708
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
Don't be mad at him.

709
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,240
Please bear with him.

710
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,950
Okay?

711
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,520
Ling Rui had been through a lot

712
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,070
when he was a kid.

713
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:57,879
He...

714
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,109
Since elementary school,

715
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,839
he'd go to the hospital to see his father

716
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,470
every day after school.

717
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,350
His father was ill in the hospital.

718
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,150
And his family was poor.

719
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,720
He couldn't pay for his school meals.

720
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,800
So...

721
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,390
I brought him the leftover bread

722
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,710
from other students.

723
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,150
I didn't know

724
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,240
he would only eat that every day.

725
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,350
He was so sensible.

726
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,360
He's trying to get her sympathy?

727
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,750
Nice trick.

728
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,270
That's not all.

729
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,550
There are more?

730
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,120
In high school,

731
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,270
Ling Rui spent only a year and a half

732
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,150
with his classmates.

733
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,280
Do you know why?

734
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,760
Why?

735
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,310
Well,

736
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,790
when he was a child,

737
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,960
his dad passed away

738
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,800
because of

739
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,480
pancreatic cancer.

740
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,920
So from then on,

741
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,000
his mother took it really hard.

742
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,080
She got ill then.

743
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,110
During his second year in high school,

744
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
his mother's illness

745
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,950
was getting worse and worse.

746
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,790
Ling Rui didn't tell anyone

747
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,760
and took his mother

748
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,680
back to his hometown

749
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
so she could get better.

750
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,870
During the college entrance exam,

751
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,830
he was admitted to

752
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,360
the national key medical university.

753
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,470
That's why I think

754
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,480
Ling Rui

755
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,270
is really awesome.

756
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,720
Extraordinary.

757
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,790
Why did you tell me these

758
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,950
all of a sudden?

759
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,110
Well... That's because

760
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,840
we don't want you

761
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,690
-to quarrel with Ling Rui.
-Yes, yes.

762
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,280
Exactly.

763
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,760
Why would I quarrel with Ling Rui?

764
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,110
Ling Rui is a good husband.

765
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,270
Well, I'll go to work.

766
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,440
Mr. Yu,

767
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,360
are you here to buy furniture?

768
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,760
Yes.

769
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Don't pay. Remember, don't pay.

770
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,080
But...

771
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,470
Fangning,

772
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,680
if something happened between you two,

773
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,750
you can always tell me,

774
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,120
all right?

775
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm on your side.

776
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,950
Can you give me
a set of furniture for free, too?

777
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,720
Hello,

778
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,910
what can I do for you?

779
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,110
Are you all right, miss?

780
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,670
Pack me all your

781
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,710
best kinds of bread

782
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,790
in your shop.

783
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,630
No.

784
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,310
All kinds of bread.

785
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,990
One of each, all of them.

786
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
Are you sure?

787
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,990
Yes.

788
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,520
Ms. Liu.

789
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,800
I think there's something wrong
with these moves.

790
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,990
Look,

791
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,400
I have long hands, feet, and neck.

792
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,350
Those basic exercises

793
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:01,950
will hinder me from

794
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,030
doing elegant moves.

795
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,270
Only the most graceful moves

796
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,040
are suitable for me.

797
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,630
I want graceful moves.

798
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,630
Well then...

799
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,440
Let me think about it.

800
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,190
That's right. Think about it.

801
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,720
Think about it.

802
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,880
I'll take a break.

803
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,160
Okay, okay.

804
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,360
I'll head out for a minute.

805
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,080
Bye.

806
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,470
Lu Fangning,

807
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,680
just wait.

808
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,320
I'll definitely beat you

809
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,600
in dancing.

810
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,310
Lu Fangyu?

811
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,230
What's he doing here?

812
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,870
Okay,

813
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,960
our break is over.

814
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,870
Let's get started.

815
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,080
Feet to the fifth position.

816
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,470
Hands get into the first position. Get ready.

817
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,680
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

818
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,400
Look at yourself in the mirror.

819
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,120
Good. Five, six, seven, eight.

820
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,120
One, two, three, four.

821
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,000
Five, six, seven, eight.

822
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,320
Good. Keep your posture.

823
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,710
What are you doing?

824
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,080
You almost scared me to death.

825
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
How's that?

826
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,870
How is Ms. Liu's lesson?

827
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,960
Come with me, come on.

828
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,590
Come. Let me...

829
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,760
Let me tell you something.

830
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,830
It's okay. Let's talk here.

831
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,870
Well...

832
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,190
Tangtang.

833
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,550
The instructors in our studio

834
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,990
are actually...

835
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,110
all excellent dancers.

836
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,590
Are you trying to change an instructor for me?

837
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,200
You knew?

838
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,520
My current instructor is terrible at teaching.

839
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,150
I was planning to get a new instructor anyway.

840
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,950
I can recommend one for you.

841
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,760
How about that?

842
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,000
Even though he's a man,

843
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,190
Mr. Lu teaches very well.

844
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,630
A man?

845
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,080
Mr. Lu?

846
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,870
Tangtang, to be frank with you.

847
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,600
Although Mr. Lu

848
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,190
is the brother of my nephew's wife,

849
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,910
that's not why

850
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,350
I recommended him.

851
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,830
He's one of the

852
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,110
best instructors here.

853
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,640
And he is a nice person.

854
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,950
When I was in trouble,

855
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,830
he lent me money without hesitation.

856
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,640
Where can we find such a good man?

857
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,870
Is your nephew surnamed Ling?

858
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,880
It's Ling Rui?

859
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,030
Do you know him?

860
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,550
Lower your voice.

861
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,800
What's wrong?

862
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,360
Hey.

863
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,990
I was wondering

864
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,270
what smells go well.

865
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,510
It turns out it's Ms. Cai

866
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,390
eating some fancy food.

867
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,670
It's not even the end of the month.

868
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,680
You can tell me if you run out of money.

869
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,790
You'll lend me money?

870
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,880
No.

871
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,230
Darn it.

872
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,670
It tastes so bad.

873
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,990
Why is life so hard?

874
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,510
Hello, Cai Siyu, Planning Department.

875
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
I knew you're working overtime.

876
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,670
Come to my office.

877
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,710
I'll treat you to dinner.

878
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,350
Okay, I'm coming!
