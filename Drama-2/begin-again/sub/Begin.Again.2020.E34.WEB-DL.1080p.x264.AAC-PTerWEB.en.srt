[Episode 34]

4
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,590
A proposal?

5
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,520
Right.

6
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,440
What do you think if it's public?

7
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
Is it touching? Is it romantic?

8
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,750
Let me think about it.

9
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,550
Proposing in public…

10
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:05,720
One proposes

11
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,150
in front of a crowd.

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,520
He must kneel on one knee,

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
hand the ring

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,990
and say loads of cheesy lines.

15
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,200
The crowd would cheer for them

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,310
and say,

17
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,940
"Marry him, marry him!"

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,910
What does it have to do with them?

19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,190
It's none of their businesses.

20
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,400
Marriage is supposed to be

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,040
an important decision

22
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,680
made by two people

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,270
after thinking rationally.

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
When did it

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
become a fancy show?

26
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,360
Proposing in public

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,750
is using the pressure from the crowd

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,630
to force the other one to say yes.

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,200
It's too arrogant to be romantic.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
It's just for show.

31
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,830
Are these people enough?

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,600
Who else can I invite?

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,870
Give it another thought.

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,630
Both parties are willing.

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Think about it,

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,480
the grass,

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,910
the balloons,

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,040
the curtains.

39
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,520
And...

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
And…

41
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
Candles.

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,590
Candles.

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,430
In a dark room,

44
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,800
candles are arranged

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,190
in the shape of a heart.

46
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,160
So are the balloons.

47
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,070
Right!

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,150
The rose petals should be arranged

49
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,230
in the shape of heart, as well.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
That's so cheesy.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,680
[Daily special offers! A special gift for your loved one at 26.66 yuan!]

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,070
So people

53
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,390
need these for a proposal.

54
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,070
These are not important.

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,279
What's important is

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,800
the love behind the surprise.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,670
That's important, of course,

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,430
but it's bad that

59
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,710
the surprise turns into a shock.

60
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,960
There's a man

61
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,350
who hid the ring

62
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,720
in a piece of cake for the proposal.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
But his girlfriend swallowed the ring

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,590
while eating the cake.

65
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,190
If the ring's stuck in her windpipe,

66
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,440
it will be such a tragedy.

67
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,520
Another guy

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
hid the ring

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,920
in his wound.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,760
Then he went to

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,830
his girlfriend who's a nurse

72
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,760
to get it out.

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,120
Just picture it.

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
His girlfriend picked the ring out of

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,750
the bloody wound

76
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,590
with tweezers.

77

[Shocking! A Russian man hid a wedding ring inside his belly wound!]

78
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,560
A Russian man

79
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,550
hid his proposal ring

80
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,120
in a wound on his belly

81
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
and proposed to his girlfriend?

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
How could he do this?

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,510
How creative.

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,870
Lu Fangning!

85
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,920
What?

86
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,440
Wait,

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
you two asked me here

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,870
to enjoy your cooking.

89
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,670
Where is the food?

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,280
In the end,

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,230
all I have is an unpeeled apple.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,750
What's going on

93
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,840
with you two?

94
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,190
Why are you asking me so many things

95
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,030
about proposal now?

96
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,950
What happened?

97
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
I...

98
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,960
-She has a proposal scene!
-She writes about a proposal!

99
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,960
That made sense.

100
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,600
Ms. Lu.

101
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,120
That came out of nowhere.

102
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,710
Not to mention they gave strange answers.

103
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,680
They specifically asked me

104
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,990
about proposals…

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,070
And Ling Rui…

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,630
Didn't I say yes ages ago?

107
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,720
This is unnecessary.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
I don't need this romantic ceremony.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
It's a waste of money.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,030
What should I do?

111
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Welcome home.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
What are you doing?

113
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,440
I was just searching for some information online.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,390
About what? Let me see it.

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
It's for the hospital.

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,110
It's very boring.

117
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,950
Let me have a look.

118
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,190
There's nothing to see. Let it go.

119
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,600
You are acting too suspicious.

120
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
-Don't be so stingy!
-I told you.

121
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
It's nothing.

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
Just forget it.

123
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,200
Trust me.

124
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,830
You're overreacting.

125
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,110
Are you messaging someone?

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,830
No. Who would I message anyone?

127
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,750
Let me see it. Just a sneak peek.

128
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,280
-Listen to me.
-Just let me have a look.

129
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,230
Your phone.

130
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,270
Phone.

131
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,880
I can check your phone. Give it to me.

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,510
Your phone is ringing.

133
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,950
Answer the call.

134
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll question you later.

135
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,440
Hello?

136
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200

What do I know about art parks?

139
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,030
I just mentioned it

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,560
to someone

141
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
from Ming Cheng,

142
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,550
he did the job

143
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,280
for me voluntarily.

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,270
I won't let Lu Fangning

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,920
do business here.

146
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,400
Mr. Gao,

147
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,480
did I do a great job?

I'm serving justice

149
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,950
for both of us.

150
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,440
Very good. Well done.

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,470
I didn't expect

152
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,110
even when Lu Fangning's gone,

153
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,120
she could still help me

154
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,710
quell a treacherous

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,120
employee.

156

Mr. Gao.

157
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,560
I was only

158
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
trying to find out

159
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,150
who used me as their scapegoat.

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
Who knows?

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,070
Manager Yang, impressive work.

162
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,910
You secretly handed over

163
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,920

167
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,910
The projects, amounts,

168
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,990
and details are all here.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,030
Manager Yang, please have a closer look.

170
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,960
If I wronged you

171
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,040
with any of the charges,

172
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,230
I could help you

173
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,430
reduce the amount of compensation.

174
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,160
By the way,

175
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,390
how's your son doing lately?

176
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,910
As the saying goes,

177
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,950
the fish begins to rot

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,560
at the head.

179
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,430
Give HR a call.

180
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,550
They can handle the rest.

181
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,960
Fire him, fined him, and make it a public announcement.

182
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,960
Do it now.

183
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,150
Don't make me repeat myself.

184
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes, Mr. Gao.

185
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,390
Those jerks.

186
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,830
How dare they hurt my delicate arm!

187
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,080
Fortunately, justice is never late.

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,950
They are finally arrested.

189
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,859
What's wrong?

190
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:52,680
They've got caught.

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,830
Why do you still look upset?

192
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,150
I'm happy.

193
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,590
And someone else

194
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,790
is going to pay for his medical bill.

195
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,070
It doesn't count as work injuries.

196
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,990
I know you're mean with your words.

197
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,240
You still care about me, right?

198
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,840
That's enough. I don't care.

199
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,760
You're worried about my arm, right?

200
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,200
Come on.

201
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,470
My arm!

202
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,680
This is the precious arm

203
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,800
that makes you money.

204
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,000
Otherwise,

205
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,880
why did you confront

206
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,030
your enemy for me?

207
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,030
However,

208
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,600
I think you got the wrong guy.

209
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,440
I can confront him as I please.

210
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
I don't need a reason.

211
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,270
[It seems like]

212
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,950
[you've]

213
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,230
[stooped very low while I was away.]

214
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,160
I didn't know

215
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,680
you were such a lousy person

216
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
who would resort to petty tricks.

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,190
Do you think

218
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,030
you're the most pitiful

219
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,790
and the greatest person alive?

220
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,630
Is that why you think

221
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,390
we must play along

222
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,840
with your overdramatic story?

223
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,080
I've warmed some milk for you.

224
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,040
Drink it.

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,880
Thank you.

226
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
That's all?

227
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,230
What's wrong?

228
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
The problems are all solved.

229
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
The park is ready for businesses.

230
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,670
Don't worry about it.

231
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,790
Have some rest.

232
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,440
I just think

233
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,190
I've wronged him.

234
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,240
When did you ever regret

235
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,430
scolding others?

236
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,350
I don't

237
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,320
regret it at all!

238
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,190
What I said when I scolded him

239
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,950
was all reasonable.

240
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,520
You know that.

241
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,350
I might have been

242
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,480
a little harsh on him.

243
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,910
But essentially, I wasn't wrong.

244
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,480
You're so naughty.

245
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,870
What was that for?

246
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,600
Stopping you from overthinking.

247
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,950
Especially from

248
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,350
thinking about another man.

249
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,160
You consider Gao Erfan a man?

250
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,510
You're still thinking about him?

251
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,200
I…

252
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,120
What about now?

253
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,630
-And now?
-No. No.

254
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,990
Who should you be thinking?

255
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,870
I am

256
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,950
thinking about Youyou.

257
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,110
Youyou's asleep.

258
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,710
It's useless to think about him.

259
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,200
Then…

260
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm warning you.

261
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,160
Think carefully before you answer.

262
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,440
I think about you.

263
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,040
Are you sure Youyou is asleep?

264
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,140
[Gao Erfan]

265
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,710
[I'm Ling Rui.]

266
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,590
[Fangning's birthday is two days from now.]

267
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,910
[You were the one Lu Yue loved most.]

268
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,030
[I hope you could attend the party for her.]

269
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,840
This one could do.

270
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,350
It's full of bling.

271
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,230
It suits Fangning's style.

272
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,240
Sir.

273
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,790
May I help you?

274
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
I want to order this cake.

275
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,600
Sorry, sir,

276
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,290
[Blisscake]

277
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,390
we're low in stock of this cake.

278
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,230
Besides, the last one

279
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,440
had already been ordered.

280
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,990
Could you make another one?

281
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,830
I'm afraid we can't finish it by tomorrow.

282
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Well, let me explain

283
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,960
the situation to you.

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,310
My buddy

285
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,950
finally

286
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,080
asked me for help.

287
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
I must finish the task

288
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,200
with perfection.

289
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,710
Otherwise, I would fail him.

290
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,960
Maybe you could

291
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,510
give me the number of the customer

292
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,240
who ordered the cake.

293
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,190
I could talk to him.

294
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,190
Maybe he would let me have it.

295
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,000
Sorry, sir.

296
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,150
Our policies forbid us

297
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,040
from disclosing

298
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,160
customer's information.

299
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,480
He has to pick the cake up anyway.

300
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,230
I'll wait for him here.

301
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,790
Very well.

302
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,070
I could contact the customer for you.

303
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,480
Okay. Thank you.

304
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,000
Hello, sir. Are you buying some flowers?

305
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,520
I want to buy a bouquet

306
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,470
for a family member's birthday.

307
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,750
Any recommendation?

308
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,910
Well, roses are great.

309
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,200
Lilies and carnations

310
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,320
are pleasant too.

311
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,030
It depends on your preference.

312
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,430
Okay.

313
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll have a bouquet

314
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,950
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

315
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Okay.

316
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,830
Sorry.

317
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,360
I looked it up.

318
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Bluebells symbolize

319
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,590
true and unchanging love.

320
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,950
It's only right to

321
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,280
[commemorate our first date]

322
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,160
[with it.]

323
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,000
Sir.

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,750
Sir.

325
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,470
Are you interested in the bluebells?

326
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,640
It just arrived this morning.

327
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,920
They are still fresh.

328
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,030
I can pack a bouquet for you

329
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
to take away.

330
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,360
No, thank you.

331
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Hello.

332
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,230
Didn't you agree to

333
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,830
help me

334
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,040
get my inspiration today?

335
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,360
Are you free later?

336
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,950
[What do you want?]

337
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,120
Is it another

338
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,520
waist injury or something worse?

339
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,310
Then I'm not free.

340
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,630
This is the last time.

341
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,440
[What do you mean?]

342
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,550
[Meet me for the last time]

343
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,270
So that I could assure you

344
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,840
I won't bother you again.

345
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,870
[Is he up to something again?]

346
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,440
[Maybe he really wants to help.]

347
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,080
[I'm not afraid of you.]

348
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,870
Sure.

349
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,240
Fountain Square.

350
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,360
See you there.

351
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,560
He's not my boss.

352
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,190
Why should I do what he asks?

353
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:56,310
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

354
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,010
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

355
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:15,420
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

356
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,269
♫ But who will watch them with me ♫

357
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,460
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

358
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,200
♫ I like you ♫

359
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,910
♫ Only you ♫

360
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,650
♫ You're my one and only ♫

361
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,870
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,800
[Will the rain ever stop?]

363
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,840
[Is she coming?]

364
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
[What if she can't find me?]

365
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,360
[No.]

366
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,860
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo, and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

367
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,180
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

368
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,540
♫ We can lie on the beach and count the stars ♫

369

♫ I like you because you put up with me ♫

370
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,700
♫ My unyielding stubbornness ♫

371
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,480
♫ It's all because of you ♫

372
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,070
Why're you standing in the rain?

373
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,950
I was afraid you couldn't find me.

374
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,270
How long have you been waiting?

375
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,310
Not that long.

376
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,270
You arrived soon after me.

377
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,390
This is for you.

378
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,400
I realized

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,720
I've never given you any flowers.

380
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,120
But sadly,

381
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,080
they are drenched now.

382
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,720
[Is this]

383
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,950
[part of his trick?]

384
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,550
You don't like it?

385
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,160
Why are you giving me flowers?

386
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,550
It's been six years.

387
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,710
You helped me realize

388
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,520
one can't have love

389
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,990
without working hard for it.

390
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,110
I didn't deserve

391
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,870
your love

392
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,070
six years ago.

393
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,350
Six years have passed,

394
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,910
I still don't deserve

395
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,080
your greatness.

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,470
Therefore,

397
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,600
I want to give it another try.

398
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,550
Siyu,

399
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,560
I like you.

400
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,920
Please be my girlfriend.

401
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,120
It's raining again.

402
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,800
Hello, I'm here to

403
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,640
pick up the cake I ordered.

404
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,230
Okay, just a minute.

405
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,880
What are you doing here?

406
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,160
It's you?

407
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,840
Did you order the cake?

408
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,680
Yes.

409
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,190
We've ordered

410
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,670
the same cake, right?

411
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,360
There're so many bakeries on this street,

412
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,390
but we picked the same one.

413
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,080
Fate has brought us together.

414
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,470
Very well.

415
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,910
The cake is for Lu Fangning anyway.

416
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,950
It doesn't matter who got it.

417
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,320
I'll leave it to you. I must go now.

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,510
Wait!

419
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,120
I haven't seen you in days.

420
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,710
Why are you leaving so soon?

421
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,640
Well,

422
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,280
I have to buy so many things

423
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,720
for Ling Rui.

424
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,000
Time is running out.

425
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,470
Then let me go with you.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,710
Well.

427
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,880
You don't have to do this.

428
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,360
We should

429
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,230
shop separately.

430
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,950
No.

431
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,030
I won't let

432
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,830
Lu Fangning's birthday party

433
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,040
become a disaster.

434
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,390
It can't be that bad.

435
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,840
Well, not all hopes are lost.

436
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,920
At least you have a good eye for cakes.

437
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,670
Your sense of aesthetic

438
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,080
is pretty impressive.

439
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,030
I've seen her in some ads!

440
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,310
Who's the man next to her?

441
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,350
Her boyfriend?

442
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,870
What's wrong?

443
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,400
Let's go now.

444
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,560
So why did you turn me down?

445
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,120
Where are we going?

446
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,510
-Let's go.
-Shall we go to…

447
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,470
We didn't pick up the cake.

448
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,600
Pick it up later.

449
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,710
Goodness.

450
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,350
Luckily, no one took pictures of us.

451
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
You should be more careful next time.

452
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,880
-Be careful of what?
-Take it.

453
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,600
Come here.

454
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,400
No.

455
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,430
I just told you about this.

456
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,670
Are you coming or not?

457
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,510
I won't use it if you won't.

458
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,280
Come on. Cover yourself.

459
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,640
Stay under it.

460
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,550
What do you think?

461
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,470
Do you feel the love in the air?

462
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,200
Your heart is beating so fast.

463
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,350
Pingping,

464
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,150
the rain stopped.

465
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,230
Pingping, that was uncalled for.

466
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Right?

467
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,310
You...

468
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
You have a bright future

469
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,230
in your career.

470
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,110
Dating an ordinary guy

471
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,990
will only get you

472
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,160
into troubles.

473
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,880
I'm not afraid of trouble.

474
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,920
There's not a relationship

475
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,110
without troubles.

476
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,880
Besides,

477
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't mind at all.

478
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,070
Pingping,

479
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,320
let's not see each other again.

480
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,640
Since we can't be friends,

481
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,830
allow me

482
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,630
to be a fan,

483
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,400
and you can carry on with your career.

484
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,670
My feelings for you are

485
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,760
nothing more than

486
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,320
a fan's admiration.

487
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,680
Bye.

488
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,230
I'm still so beautiful.

489
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,760
Thank you.

490
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,110
You're welcome.

491
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,270
You're gorgeous.

492
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,520
You heard it outside.

493
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,640
You don't need these compliments.

494
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,590
You're beautiful

495
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,870
all the time.

496
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,760
I think so too.

497
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,160
What are you laughing about?

498
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,350
It just occurred to me

499
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,710
that you've done something

500
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
I've always

501
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,800
wanted to do

502
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
but never succeeded.

503
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,040
Good.

504
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,960
It's a great start for today.

505
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,190
What else

506
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,350
have you not realized?

507
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,790
Are you willing to

508
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,760
play along with my requests?

509
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,870
It's enough.

510
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,800
I was just joking.

511
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,350
You're still the same.

512
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,470
You lack the courage to do what you want.

513
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,840
I had enough courage

514
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,630
to make you my man.

515
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,600
That's enough.

516
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Stop it.

517
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,000
I must go to work.

518
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,470
I'll play with you later.

519
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,120
Our store is opening soon.

520
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,910
I don't know

521
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,710
what kind of mess

522
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,120
Shen Zhuo might cause over there.

523
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,630
No.

524
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,990
You can't go to work today.

525
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,080
Let's go to the theme park.

526
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,280
[That was a little sudden.]

527
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,480
[Is he going to

528
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,470
[propose to me there?]

529
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,400
Sure.

530
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Then let me check

531
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
if Youyou is ready.

532
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,870
Is Youyou coming with us?

533
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,240
Sure.

534
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,150
Youyou has never gone

535
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,400
to a theme park with us.

536
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,190
He will be very happy.

537
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,070
What's wrong?

538
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,190
Sure. Let's go.

539
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,470
Make it lower.

540
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,600
Lower.

541
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,430
这样 再下点儿你

542
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,590
It's not level.

543
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,510
Now?

544
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,910
Can you handle it or not?

545
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,030
Do I know…

546
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,440
Do it yourself if you're so great.

547
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,870
Why don't you do it?

548
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,910
I just told you

549
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,880
not to be rude to others.

550
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,480
Do you want me

551
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,430
to give your arm a twist?

552
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,760
You were barely

553
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,200
useful.

554
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,350
But you won't stop nagging

555
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,760
now that we have no use for you.

556
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,870
Well?

557
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,240
Shut up.

558
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,310
Hello, Dr. Peng.

559
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,600
Hello, Ms. Tang.

560
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,230
I'll set up the candles.

561
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,720
Welcome!

562
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
Sir, Madam, you're back.

563
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,550
You got here early.

564
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,830
Right. Yiyao has

565
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,910
picked us up at the airport.

566
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,200
We came here right away.

567
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,160
Where's Lu Fangyu?

568
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,270
He's waiting for the luggage.

569
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,990
Where's Youyou?

570
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,560
Where's my sweet Youyou?

571
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,870
He's out with Fangning

572
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,880
and Ling Rui.

573
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
They'll be back soon.

574
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,430
Take your time,

575
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,880
I must pick up my girlfriend.

576
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,920
Your girlfriend?

577
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,720
Sir, Madam, have a look.

578
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,480
You could tell me

579
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,600
if there's any problem.

580
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,550
Everything's fine.

581
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,350
I have to take a look.

582
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,560
Who hung this?

583
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,030
The balloon is flaccid.

584
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,200
Take it down.

585
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,680
Move this aside.

586
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,670
Okay, okay.

587
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,150
Yang Yi, it already looks great.

588
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,720
Young man,

589
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,230
don't lift the can.

590
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,790
It would be very dangerous if you drop the can.

591
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,830
Leave it to me.

592
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,030
Tang Ping, you…

593
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,600
Here, come and have a look.

594
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,870
This is too wrinkly.

595
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,270
Yang Yi.

596
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,550
Just leave it to them.

597
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:57,960
Let me do it.

598
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,510
Don't just stand there.

599
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,640
Come here and give us a hand.

600
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,470
Our in-laws are here!

601
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,430
Auntie!

602
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,520
Long time no see.

603
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,110
Long time no see.

604
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,080
You've become prettier.

605
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,800
I miss you so much.

606
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,320
In-laws.

607
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,280
Right.

608
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,760
What are you saying?

609
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,110
What are you doing?

610
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,280
Good.

611
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,200
Show some manner. They're our in-laws.

612
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,920
Hello, in-laws.

613
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,640
Hello, in-laws.

614
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,950
It's been years.

615
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,670
You're so beautiful now.

616
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,800
Your skin looks great.

617
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,840
Look at me.

618
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,910
I have freckles on my face.

619
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,880
She got it from the beaches.

620
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,470
What products do you use?

621
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,470
It's a secret.

622
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,030
Well,

623
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,310
let's take a break inside.

624
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,680
Leave the work to them.

625
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,430
-Right.
-Carry on with the work.

626
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,640
Don't listen to her.

627
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,630
Follow your plans.

628
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,910
Okay.

629
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,280
Let's get working.

630
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,430
Why aren't you working?

631
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,030
Carry on.

632
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,750
You're always so bossy.

633
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,360
Pingping.

634
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,190
What took you so long?

635
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,080
Is Fangning here?

636
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,830
Not yet.

637
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,800
So why are you so worried?

638
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,120
There are so many things to do.

639
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,470
What took you so long?

640
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,750
Why should I tell you?

641
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,560
Hand it over.

642
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,230
The flowers.

643
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,480
I forgot about you.

644
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,400
Can you manage? Let me help you.

645
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,720
No, I can handle it.

646
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay then.

647
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,710
Come on, quickly.

648
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,840
Make haste.

649
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,480
You two.

650
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,560
Idiot.

651
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,750
Your girlfriend doesn't know you.

652
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,440
President.

653
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,830
Hold it yourself.

654
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,350
Give me a hand.

655
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,110
Hold it yourself.

656
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,590
Get that here.

657
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,520
Move it there.

658
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,440
Okay.

659
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,870
Here you are.

660
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,390
Be careful with it.

661
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,960
Hang it there.

662
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,830
Enough.

663
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,750
You can be sweet when you're home.

664
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,470
Can't you do it yourself?

665
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,430
Your waist…

666
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,190
Good for you.

667
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,870
Can you not make it so ugly?

668
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,510
I…

669
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,550
Everything is boring

670
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,390
when you're around.

671
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,440
Coming.

672
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,200
It's super beautiful.

673
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,990
Put it on.

674
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,150
It's so pretty.

675
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,000
I bought the cake.

676
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,910
I bought it.

677
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,350
I bought it.

678
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,110
They're back!

679
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,520
-They're coming!
-Coming.

680
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,390
What should we do?

681
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,570
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

682
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,480
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

683
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,430
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

684
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,370
I'm asking you. What should we do?

685
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,270
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

686
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,080
Turn the lights off.

687
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,240
Turn the lights off.

688
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Dad.

689
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,120
Did you have fun today?

690
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,360
Yes.

691
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,200
Really?

692
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,720
They are coming.

693
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,960
If you don't have so many snacks,

694
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,710
we will

695
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,800
take you to the theme park again, okay?

696
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,480
-It's Youyou's voice.
-Right.

697
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,720
Nothing happened when Youyou's around.

698
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,710
Just as I expected.

699
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
This is…

700
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,190
What a coincidence.

701
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,160
Someone else is

702
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,070
celebrating their birthday here today.

703
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,430
Who did all this?

704
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,830
I have no idea.

705
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,750
Let's have a look then.

706
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,190
Sure. Let's have a look.

707
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,550
Come on. Let's have a look.

708
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,790
[It's so dark.]

709
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,070
[He has really changed.]

710
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,440
[He even knows to surprise me.]

711
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,120
Why are we hiding?

712
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,760
We could have just waited for them there.

713
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,240
Why are we standing here?

714
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,510
Turn the lights on.

715
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,400
Lights on.

716
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,720
Lights on.

717
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,670
Lights on.

718
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,310
Lights on.

719
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,960
Lights on.

720
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,680
Lights on.

721
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,790
You just asked me to turn the lights off,

722
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,040
not to turn it on.

723
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,920
-What?
-Oh, come on!

724
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,480
You turned the lights off.

725
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,400
Of course, you should turn it on.

726
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,080
What are you doing?

727
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,230
How could I turn the lights on?

728
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,030
Who knows?

729
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,030
Only you know.

730
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,840
How could I know?

731
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,840
Just send someone

732
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,520
to go turn the light on.

733
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,760
Where's the switch?

734
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,840
-Don't move.
-Who's been moving?

735
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,720
-Who's under the table?
-It's okay.

736
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,840
Slow down.

737
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,350
What's happening?

738
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,920
The table is moving!

739
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,360
What are they doing?

740
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,800
Don't move.

741
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,990
Don't move.

742
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,590
Get out.

743
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,640
Come on.

744
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:17,990
You…

745
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,950
How did you fit in there?

746
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,419
Why were you hiding under the table?

747
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,339
This is your fault.

748
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:29,189
What?

749
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:29,810
Did you spill it?

750
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,399
Yeah.

751
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,270
Sorry.

752
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,160
Let's go.

753
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,790
Come on. Let's go.

754
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,960
What does it have to do with me?

755
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Someone grabbed

756
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,149
my arm just now.

757
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,109
Was it you?

758
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,160
It hurt so much.

759
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,589
Fangning.

760
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,419
I planned this

761
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,149
myself.

762
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,120
I asked them to celebrate your birthday.

763
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,339
I didn't expect this to happen.

764
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,990
It's all your fault.

765
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,570
Wait? How it is my fault?

766
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,990
Mum, Happy Birthday!

767
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,710
Happy Birthday!

768
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,790
Happy Birthday!

769
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,200
-Happy Birthday!
-Sister!

770
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,750
Happy Birthday!

771
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,110
I can finally say this.

772
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,120
Happy Birthday!

773
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,110
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!

774
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
You're so noisy.

775
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,910
Thank you.

776
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,960
What are you doing?

777
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,640
You haven't said anything.

778
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,070
Happy Birthday!

779
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,070
Happy Birthday!

780
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,000
Happy Birthday, Fangning.

781
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,300
Happy Birthday!

782
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,260
-Happy Birthday!
-Thank you.

783
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,440
Thank you.

784
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,520
Mom.

785
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,520
Thank you.

786
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,240
Thank you for all.

787
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
It's nothing.

788
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,400
Happy birthday!

789
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,030
Mom, Aunt.

790
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,990
Thank you.

791
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,430
Happy Birthday.

792
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,480
Happy Birthday.

793
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,280
Thank you.

794
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,190
Okay, okay.

795
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,310
People are watching.

796
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,390
Go ahead.

797
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,240
It's okay.

798
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Happy Birthday.

799
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
Happy Birthday.

800
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,520
You knew it, didn't you?

801
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,990
We did it.

802
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,110
But you found out anyway.

803
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,320
You are

804
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,040
very observant.

805
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,110
Thank you.

806
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,310
Have you prepared

807
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,240
more of these things?

808
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,800
Sure.

809
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,840
That's a relief.

810
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,720
Start cleaning up now.

811
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,520
Sure. Let's go.

812
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Come on, this way.

813
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,280
Thank you.

814
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,960
Mom.

815
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,790
Wonderful.

816
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,880
There is only one cake.

817
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,750
It's okay.

818
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,590
Come on.

819
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,190
This is…

820
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,520
It's amazing.

821
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,150
Is it pretty?

822
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,920
Of course.

823
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,800
Isn't your birthday today?

824
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,550

835
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,350
Brother Erfan.

836
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,960
What are you doing here?

837
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,320
Long time no see.

838
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,950
Make a wish.

839
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,390
What's happening, Dad?

840

Happy Birthday.

844
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,630
Where's my gift?

845
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,990
I forgot.

846
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,120
How could you forget the present?

847
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,090
-Yeah.
-How could you forget the present?

848
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,700
How could you forget?

849
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,640
How could you forget?

850
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,380
How could you forget?

851
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,260
I'm sorry.

852
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,250
Forget the present...

853
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,350
Hit him.

854
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,190
Okay, that's enough.

855
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,400
Stop it.

856
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,040
Come here.

857
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,280
Dismiss!

858
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,720
Just kidding.

859
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,870
Come on, let's continue.

860
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,600
One more friend.

861
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,190
Come on.

862
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,680
Who's that?

863
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,320
He's a good friend of mine.

864
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,910
Who's he?

865
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,840
Mr. Lu.

866
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,030
Okay, let's continue.

867
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,790
Change it.

868
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,710
We ran out of candles.

869
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,910
Alright, then.

870
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,240
♫ Happy Birthday to me ♫

871
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,000

Make a wish.

876
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,430
Make a wish.

877
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,800
Thank you.

878
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:54,420
♫ The rose petals have a potent fragrance ♫

879
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,510
Get lost. Dance if you want.

880
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,920
Go now.

881
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,200
Hurry.

882
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,530
♫ I don't mind walking on the streets alone ♫

883
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,380
♫ The movies are always full of disappointment and farewells ♫

884
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,570
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

885
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,560
Are you alright?

886
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,760
I didn't mean it.

887
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,070
I'm okay.

888
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,800
♫ I like you ♫

889
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:44,060
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

890
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,430
♫ Tonight is the night ♫
