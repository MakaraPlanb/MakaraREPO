[Episode 18]

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,200
Founding Infinite.

5
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,480
All this while

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,070
has been my sister's wish,

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,720
if

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,310
she hasn't left yet.

9
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,360
The person standing here now

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,400
is not me.

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,120
It's her.

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,880
So I have been

13
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,040
trying so hard to be her.

14
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,870
But actually,

15
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,040
these are just my

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,630
bad imitation of her.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,790
I will never be her.

18
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,989
Lu Yue.

19
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,610
Is completely

20
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,840
different from me.

21
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,020
This is

22
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,980
the eldest daughter of the Lu family,

23
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,010
Lu Yue.

24
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,150
Now,

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,310
she has completed her studies.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,150
On this occasion today,

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,420
I'm grandly introducing her to you all.

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,870
There is only one reason.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,270
I am going to retire.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,980
She is gentle.

31
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,960
Kind.

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
Considerate.

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,450
Completely in line with all of my dad's

34
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,430
expectations of her.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,980
That's so-so.

36
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,240
I think

37
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,040
my sister can paint a picture

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,050
better than this one.

39
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,790
Don't you think

40
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm like a picture too?

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,529
No.

42
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,210
I think you are better looking than the person in the painting.

43
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,730
You are more beautiful.

44
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,720
I didn't know at that time

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
what did she mean.

46
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,570
Until one day.

47
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,770
If you want to leave home

48
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,850
and be with him,

49
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,490
you can go die for me now!

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,210
Until one day,

51
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,570
she chose to leave,

52
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,880
to escape us.

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,570
Choose not to do be

54
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,810
the portrait is known as the Eldest Daughter of the Lu Family.

55
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,720
Big Sister,

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,530
can you come back

57
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,930
and celebrate my birthday?

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm begging you.

59
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,930
I will return.

60
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,810
See you at that park

61
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,650
that we frequently visit.

62
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,050
Fangning.

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,360
Be careful.

64
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,450
Let me put it down.

65
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Did I keep you waiting?

66
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,170
Why are you so late?

67
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,120
Happy birthday.

68
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,530
What happened?

69
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,290
Sister, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

70
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,810
It's not twelve o'clock yet.

71
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,570
Let's take the cake home.

72
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,130
Let's go home and make a wish,

73
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,570
then blow the candles together, okay?

74
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,010
I came here in a hurry this time.

75
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,770
I didn't have time to prepare a gift.

76
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,410
I don't want any gifts.

77
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,250
I just want you to accompany me home.

78
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,050
You won't really have to leave, right?

79
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,570
You can't leave me alone

80
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,730
at home.

81
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,410
Do you like him that much?

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,050
Okay then.

83
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,290
I will give you a holiday.

84
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,370
Let you go for a week.

85
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,490
You can go out with him.

86
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,960
Isn't a week enough?

87
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,280
What about a month?

88
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,570
One month later,

89
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,450
-You must…
-Fangning.

90
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,970
There are some things

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,970
that you will understand

92
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,930
when you are older.

93
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,240
I will accompany you every year

94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,280
on your birthday.

95
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,290
When I leave

96
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,440
this time,

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,210
I don't know when

98
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,010
can I come back.

99
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,730
What do you mean?

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,730
How long are you going to be away?

101
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,170
So,

102
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,250
I will be with you today.

103
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,330
Celebrate your birthday.

104
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:45,810
Okay?

105
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,490
No.

106
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,570
But…

107
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,850
Don't be like that.

108
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,130
Come on.

109
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,080
Don't be upset.

110
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,810
No.

111
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,050
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

112
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,210
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

113
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,410
♫ Happy birthday to Fangning ♫

114
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,650
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

115
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,330
I wish our little Fangning

116
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,010
Happy 18th birthday.

117
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,570
18 years old.

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,730
You are an adult now.

119
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,690
Well,

120
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,170
I hope your life

121
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,650
will be like this box of sweets,

122
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,730
always sweet.

123
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,600
You even used it yourself.

124
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,560
Congratulations to our little Fangning

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,810
graduating from college at the age of 22.

126
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,650
Then you should

127
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,920
have your first boyfriend by then?

128
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,690
You have to cherish your first love.

129
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,530
I won't have any boyfriends.

130
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,650
I wish our little Fangning

131
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,440
Happy 26th birthday.

132
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,850
At this time

133
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,450
in your life,

134
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,770
you should be embracing

135
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,010
the first peak of your career.

136
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,160
I hope that you

137
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,010
can create

138
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,930
a piece of the world that belongs to you.

139
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,330
I'm so good

140
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,170
I can reach my first career peak

141
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,489
by 25.

142
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:44,960
So smart.

143
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,369
You are so awesome.

144
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,210
28 years old.

145
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,250
You should have found

146
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,610
your other half in life.

147
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,530
I wish you

148
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,010
can be with someone you like.

149
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,930
Grow old together.

150
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,490
Be happy forever.

151
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,730
Our little Fangning is 30 years old.

152
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,650
30 years old.

153
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,410
The third decade of your life.

154
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,770
Do you have a baby?

155
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,850
I hope you can

156
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,130
treat it well.

157
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,650
Give it a happy home.

158
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,570
No.

159
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,890
Children are troublesome.

160
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,690
Actually, in my life,

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,130
my wish in this life is also very simple.

162
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,490
Before 30,

163
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,650
Have a home,

164
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,370
a child,

165
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,050
and my own

166
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,210
-Furniture Brand.
-Furniture Brand.

167
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,090
How did you know?

168
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,320
You have told me that many times.

169
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,450
These things, to you,

170
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,850
are not difficult.

171
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,330
You can definitely do it.

172
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,170
Let's work hard together.

173
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,770
Let's continue.

174
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,810
No.

175
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,010
Lu Yue.

176
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,250
I'm leaving.

177
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,090
Sister, sister!

178
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,890
Please don't go.

179
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,210
Stay at home tonight,

180
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,090
okay?

181
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,970
You have to remember

182
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,850
I will always be with you,

183
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,050
growing up with you.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,970
I haven't made a wish yet.

185
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,410
I haven't made a wish yet, Big Sister.

186
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,170
Fangning.

187
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,760
Big Sister.

188
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,570
Can you not do this?

189
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,010
Stop being childish!

190
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,930
Lu Yue, stop right there!

191
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,930
Dad.

192
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,450
Move aside.

193
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,250
Let Big Sister go.

194
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,730
Move aside.

195
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,170
Chase her down!

196
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,970
Dad, let Big Sister go.

197
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,690
Dad!

198
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,810
You.

199
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,490
Ah!

200
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,010
Fangning.

201
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,050
Fangning.

202
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,530
Unfortunately,

203
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,610
she didn't get her to wish at last.

204
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,850
A car accident

205
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,130
ruined it all.

206
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,450
Every year I will

207
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,880
receive a postcard.

208
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,850

[To: Ms. Lu Fangning]

210

They are all signed by Infinity.

211
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,610
I don't know who sent it to me.

212
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,610
They seem to be trying to

213
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,130
remind me continuously.

214
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,770
Don't forget the pain.

215
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,330
Don't forget my sister.

216
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,410
That's why I

217
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,810
work like a demon.

218
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,890
Crazily trying to fulfill her final wish.

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,410
But what can I do?

220
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,290
If she is still here,

221
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,090
she will do better than me.

222
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,330
Fangning.

223
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,010
Maybe your sister

224
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,650
don't want you to be

225
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,930
someone like her.

226
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,360
You two are different.

227
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,650
Like everyone who comes here

228
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,730
will choose different furniture.

229
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,530
Everyone's life

230
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,850
is not the same.

231
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,970
There is no right or wrong.

232
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,890
We just wish to repay.

233
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,650
Wish to repay?

234
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,810
Opportunities will not shape people.

235
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,680
But we choose to be

236
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
the kind of person we want to be.

237
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,970
You chose to be strong.

238
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,690
Fangyu is lucky.

239
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,050
Be able to have a strong sister

240
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,570

241
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

242
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,090
So I won't commit

243
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,360
the same error as before.

244
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,090

have been taken care of?

286
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,530

opinion on this?

295
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,370
This is too much.

296
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,330
It's pretty good.

297
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,370
I don't have much of an opinion.

298
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,970
Anything else?

299
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,730
He can be more feminine.

300
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,010
He can practice more.

305
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,650
or refute the rumors.

306
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,930

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,170
As for why

309
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,930
my brother

310
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,330
chose the profession of ballet.

311
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,290
I sometimes hear

312
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,370
some people say,

313
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,130
"Lu Fangning, you are a woman."

314
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,010
"Why don't you have a baby earlier?"

315
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,370
"Why don't you do housework at home?"

316
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,210
"Why do things that men do?"

317
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,810
My brother likes ballet.

318
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,610
Now he has a chance

319
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,570
and the honor to participate in this ballet troupe.

320
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,610
I feel good about this.

321
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,170
I am happy for him.

322
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,610
In the public eye, we siblings

323
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,050
seem reversed.

324
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,490
But I think

325
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,970
this is actually quite normal.

326
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,570
No one has determined

327
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,970
what should men do.

328
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,210
What a woman should do.

329
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,850
Nice job.

330
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,210
As expected from Ms. Lu.

331
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,320
Ms. Lu.

332
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,930
It seems that you have a way with words.

333
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,170
The next time you ask me this

334
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,090
I will still say

335
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,290
I have nothing to say.

336
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,720
Because I want everyone

337
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,650
to not be discussed

338
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,770
or judged

339
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,130
based on gender

340
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,370
or interests.

341
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,530
They are just like people eating

342
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,810
or drinking water. It's normal.

343
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,730
Does Chairman Lu

344
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,290
share the same idea?

345
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,210
I think you are implying something again.

346
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,930
You must think that Chairman Lu

347
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,570
is getting older,

348
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,810
has rigid thinking.

349
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,970
But I want to tell everyone

350
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,570
who is watching this interview.

351
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,530
Chairman Lu is very open.

352
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,170
He is just like everyone else in

353
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,370
Deer Sing Group.

354
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,610
He will never interfere

355
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,570
with personal freedom.

356
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,650
Nor will he view

357
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,850
the career choices others made

358
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,970
with prejudice.

359
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,800
Why did you do this?

360
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,890
You deliberately let the reporter

361
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,850
expose the photos.

362
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,130
The interview was arranged beforehand

363
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,410
by you, right?

364
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,770
Why do you want to

365
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,610
turn this into a bigger issue?

366
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,560
Lu Yiyao.

367
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,570
Everything is public now.

368
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,330
No one has

369
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,370
to hide anything now.

370
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,410
Isn't this great?

371
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,090
And I read the public opinion on the Internet.

372
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,410
Very good response.

373
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,610
We don't have to worry

374
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,810
about Deer Sing's image problem.

375
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,130
We even got some free promotions on

376
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,850
our spirit of keeping up with the times

377
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,330
as an entrepreneur.

378
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,320
What's the problem?

379
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,530
This will only make your

380
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,770
relationship with Big Brother

381
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,610
even worse.

382
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,290
Do you understand?

383
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,330
Let things settle down slowly

384
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,450
are just all method

385
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,450
to avoid the problem.

386
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,730
I don't want the happenings in the past

387
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,490
to be repeated on Fangyu.

388
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay.

389
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,370
Then why did you not

390
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,570
discuss it with me first?

391
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,490
I told you.

392
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,170
Please believe in me.

393
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,050
I will fix everything.

394
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,290
I'm afraid if I said it

395
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,970
you will react like this.

396
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,010
That's why I didn't tell you.

397
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,490
Finally,

398
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,490
with Ling Rui's encouragement,

399
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,250
I made this decision.

400
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,490
Ling Rui?

401
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,610
You are willing to listen to his opinion.

402
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,890
But not willing to discuss with me.

403
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,570
He doesn't even know what

404
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,090
happened before

405
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,250
in our house.

406
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,450
He will only exacerbate

407
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,010
the conflict between you and your Dad.

408
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,210
Lu Yiyao.

409
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,890
This matter has nothing to do with Ling Rui.

410
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,290
It's my personal decision.

411
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,570
I hope you respect me.

412
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,170
And respect my decision

413
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,250
as the general manager of this company,

414
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,400
okay?

415
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,850
Yes.

416
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,290
They all said our Fangyu

417
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,450
danced too well.

418
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,450
They even came from abroad

419
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,610
just to invite him.

420
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,330
So, we reluctantly agreed.

421
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,290
Wenbin?

422
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,730
Of course he is unwilling.

423
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,450
After all, such a big company

424
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,170
everything

425
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,130
relies on

426
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,170
Fangyu to take care of it.

427
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,930
But telecommunication is so developed now,

428
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,290
and Fangyu is smart.

429
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm sure he can manage

430
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,730
both dancing and our business.

431
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,730
He just might be a little tired.

432
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,210
Okay.

433
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,210
Sure.

434
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,330
I will invite you to come and see them then.

435
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,130
Goodbye.

436
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,890
In two hours,

437
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,000
this is the 12th call I've picked up.

438
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,200
They want to ridicule me.

439
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,050
Let them watch.

440
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,810
Give them more

441
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,650
free tickets.

442
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,770
My son, I have an idea.

443
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,650
This is an opportunity.

444
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,170
Take this chance

445
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,330
to apologize to your dad.

446
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,050
Push all the blame

447
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,480
onto Lu Fangning.

448
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,210
I'm not going.

449
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,210
Over my dead body.

450
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,680
This is all clear.

451
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,690
This news,

452
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,130
these photos,

453
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,730
she exposed them all.

454
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,290
This is Lu Fangning's trick.

455
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,930
She thought by doing so,

456
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,650
she can drive you out of Deer Sing Group.

457
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,650
Mom.

458
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,890
Are you a screenwriter?

459
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,170
Big Sister is obviously helping me.

460
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,650
How can you be so ungrateful?

461
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,530
She's helping you?

462
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,610
You are brainwashed by her!

463
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,130
I've discussed this with her a long time ago.

464
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,570
This is my own decision.

465
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,970
Only by doing this

466
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,650
will Dad allow me to

467
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,810
keep dancing.

468
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,650
You are too young.

469
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,370
Too naive.

470
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,690
Too easily deceived.

471
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,530
Lu Fangning

472
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,530
is trying to win your trust now,

473
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,010
to drive you out of Deer Sing.

474
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,090
My son,

475
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,250
I am the only one who

476
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,000
really cares about you.

477
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,650
Mom.

478
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,400
Since 10,

479
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,450
I wanted to learn ballet.

480
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,250
You are the first one

481
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,890
to reject me.

482
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,050
Every time you hit me.

483
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,010
Every time you scold me.

484
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,490
You say all this

485
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,690
is for my own good.

486
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,490
The reason

487
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,410
I keep hiding this from you

488
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,530
is only because of Dad,

489
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,610
but also because of you.

490
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,730
This time,

491
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,570
can't you stand by my side?

492
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,170
No.

493
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,450
I can allow

494
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,730
anything else.

495
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,330
Only this

496
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,410
is absolutely impossible.

497
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,370
Fangyu.

498
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,210
You are too young.

499
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,570
Someday you will understand

500
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,090
my reasons for doing this.

501
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,010
I won't let anyone

502
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,050
take away

503
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,050
your things.

504
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,280
I will protect you.

505
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,610
Have you contacted the dance troupe?

506
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,730
Yes.

507
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,810
Later,

508
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,160
there is an important meeting.

509
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,610
I can't take you to the airport.

510
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,850
When you are abroad alone,

511
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,570
take care of yourself.

512
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,770
Be careful.

513
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,130
Big Sister,

514
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,600
if you suddenly act like this

515
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,250
even I'm a little uncomfortable.

516
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,800
Silly boy.

517
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,730
I'm leaving.

518
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,290
Go.

519
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,530
Take care of yourself.

520
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,370
Okay.

521
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,570
Call me if anything happens.

522
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,810
Go.

523
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,330
Okay.

524
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,010
Get lost.

525
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,370
Big Sister,

526
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,170
remember to visit me.

527
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,120
Don't you play around over there.

528
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,650
Chairman Lu.

529
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,290
Young master may be going to the airport.

530
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,650
Ms. Lu is also there.

531
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,010
Do you want to stop him?

532
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,130
Let him go.

533
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,530
Come.

534
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,050
I have something to tell you.

535
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:23,890
Sister, not so hard, please!

536
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,130
Don't you get lazy there, understand?

537
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,090
Now I'm paying for

538
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,210
your flight,

539
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,090
your ride,

540
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,370
and your tuition.

541
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,570
Study hard.

542
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,290
Dance hard.

543
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,170
Do you hear me?

544
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,040
-I know you.
-Give me back

545
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,490
all the money you've siphoned

546
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,410
from my pocket all these years.

547
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,210
-Go.
-Okay.

548
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,210
Erfan.

549
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm flying away.

550
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,010
But I remember.

551
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,570
Regret

552
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,640
and frustration

553
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,480
are countless times worse

554
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,730
than fear.

555
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,170
I wish you can

556
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,330
survive my sister's torture this year.

557
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,770
All the best at the conference.

558
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,010
Next,

559
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,210
I will share my latest news

560
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,410
with all of you.

561
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,210
Didn't I just experience a heartbreak

562
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,410
recently?

563
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,730
Now I'm all well.

564
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,770
Because I have this.

565
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,690
Can you see it?

566
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,330
Although due to

567
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,210
dire circumstances

568
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,400
he can't be with me.

569
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,170
But he has sent me

570
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,250
this love number plate.

571
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,210
No doubt,

572
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,410
in his heart I'm the

573
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,450
Number One.

574
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,330
Tang Pingping.

575
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,250
Come.

576
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,050
Come here,

577
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,410
That's all for today.

578
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,370
Heart.

579
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,740
[Ling Rui, Shenzhen Huiren Hospital]

580
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,130
Ling Rui?

581
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,570
Since I'm here already,

582
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,730
taking a picture with Mr. Lu

583
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,210
shouldn't be too much.

584
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,490
Shameless and stupid.

585
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,010
Wishful thinking.

586
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,810
Plain and smelly Tang Ping.

587
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,840
Your professional vocabulary is quite expansive.

588
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,170
I seem to know this

589
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,210
the owner of this recorder.

590
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,610
I'll give it back to them.

591
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:37,930
Siyu.

592
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,450
Well,

593
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,050
give me the recorder.

594
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,250
Wait a moment.

595
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,290
Here you go.

596
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:46,840
Okay.

597
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,250
What do you need a recorder for?

598
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,250
For work.

599
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,290
Okay, thank you.

600
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,730
Ms. Lu,

601
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,490
this is our

602
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,170
Schematic diagram for the live conference.

603
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,850
Here is the entrance

604
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,570
we'll display our logo prominently,

605
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,930
and some brochures.

606
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,360
In the middle is the main stage.

607
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,610
Because our entire showroom

608
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,130
is a pillarless exhibition,

609
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,170
inline with

610
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,130
Infinity's

611
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,240
modern minimalist style,

612
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,410
we have built this big screen

613
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,930
and the main stage

614
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,240
consisting of three round platforms.

615
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,770
Didn't I say

616
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,210
that the whole venue

617
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,130
has to use Infinity's furniture?

618
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,530
What's going on with this stage?

619
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,410
This…

620
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,250
This is

621
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,880
a typical host stand.

622
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,210
So why is there

623
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,890
a typical host stand?

624
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,560
But Ms. Lu,

625
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,090
among Infinity's new products,

626
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,450
there is no table of this height.

627
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,130
If there isn't,

628
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,050
can't you find products from different series

629
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,210
and assemble them?

630
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,250
If you can't do it,

631
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,490
can't you find people from other departments

632
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,570
to help you?

633
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,970
Yes.

634
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:53,970
Do we have the confirmed

635
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,130
guest list?

636
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,570
Yes.

637
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:57,730
We are still pending the

638
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,810
final answer from two guests.

639
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,690
How long has it been?

640
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,890
They said they would reply before 10 pm.

641
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,370
Why is it taking so long?

642
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,010
If they don't come

643
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,530
there will be two empty seats

644
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,410
in the front row.

645
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,410
Are you telling me

646
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,330
we are getting two random people

647
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,530
to sit in the front row and let reporters shoot them?

648
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,530
But they…

649
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,610
Before we get off work today,

650
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,490
if they are not coming,

651
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,210
get someone else.

652
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,090
Okay.

653
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,650
Ms. Lu.

654
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,810
Shall we

655
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,730
take a 10-minute break?

656
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,610
Okay.

657
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,250
Break for 10 minutes.

00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,810

665
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,370
How many times have you read it?

666
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,410
15 or 16.

667
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,410
I can't remember.

668
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,490
You know it too.

I'm probably.

673
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,050
A little bit.

674
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,130
A little bit.

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,010
Oh, well.

676
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,130

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,770
Close your eyes.

Take a deep breath.

00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,080
Yeah?

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,930
She knows

777
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,930
the reason we got married.

778
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,410
Then she ran away.

779
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,570
Cai Siyu could not

780
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,450
find her at the venue.

781
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,010
How would she know?

782
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,530
Lu Yiyao.

783
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,650
Just now…

784
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,050
I understand.

785
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,090
Give a round of applause to Infinity,

786
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,250
Deer Sing Group's latest home furnishing brand.

787
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,850
Welcome to the official release today.

788
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,120
Dear guests, friends from the media,

789
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,250
you all must know Infinity

790
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,930
is a young brand

791
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,890
personally created by

792
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,430
the general manager of Deer Sing Group

793
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,770
Ms. Lu Fangning.

794
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,250
Thanks to Ms. Lu…

795
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,450
Who is she?

796
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,210
Mrs. Lu.

797
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,210
What does this mean?

798
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:14,850
Yeah.

799
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,210
Why is she up there?

800
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,690
What happened?

801
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,050
Ms. Yang Yi, please…

802
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,010
Is this a part of the program?

803
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,010
I don't know.

804
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,450
This arrangement is weird.
