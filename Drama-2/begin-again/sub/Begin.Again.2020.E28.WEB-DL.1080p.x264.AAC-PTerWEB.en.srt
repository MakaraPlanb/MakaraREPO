[Episode 28]

4
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,790
My waist...

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,380
What is your next plan?

6
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,900
You look like you're about to die.

7
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,500
Old man, stop following me.

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Go back and rest.

9
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,179
Who says I'm about to die?

10
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,989
You can't keep up with us youngsters' pace.

11
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:02,860
Cai Siyu.

12
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,660
I'll tell you again.

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,340
I am not old.

14
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,500
If you don't believe me, try me.

15
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,820
My next activity

16
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,770
is not for you.

17
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,740
What activity is not suitable for me?

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,140
Dad.

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,850
Love you!

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,950
Hey, Siyu.

21
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,060
Hey, Tang Ping.

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,980
Let's come out and eat.

23
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,580
Hello?

24
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,060
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence.

25
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,490
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

26
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,900
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

27
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,300
Ling Rui knows about Youyou's existence?

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,660
Who?

29
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,860
Youyou?

30
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,380
Why does it sound like a child's name?

31
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,290
Fangning.

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,460
Fangning...

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,140
Get out of the way.

34
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,690
Did you come back

35
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,620
together with Dr. Ling's son?

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,940
You kept this from him for six years?

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,100
Yeah...

38
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,020
You're like the ex-wife who's back with their kid to look for trouble.

39
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,460
Lu Fangning...

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,660
You're more dramatic than I thought.

41
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,500
Cai Siyu.

42
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,779
Hey, Fangning...

43
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,700
Who...

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,380
You go.

45
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,060
Go!

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,940
Fangning.

47
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,660
Step aside.

48
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,900
Are you okay?

49
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,580
You have to take good care of your back.

50
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,180
Did you have a baby with another man

51
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,820
while you were abroad?

52
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,540
You're awesome!

53
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,700
Is he mixed?

54
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,010
Mixed-race kids are so pretty!

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,380
Another man?

56
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,260
Yeah.

57
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:30,410
Or else, why did you

58
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,300
keep it from Dr. Ling?

59
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,300
Do you think I'm stupid?

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,710
It's not that I think that you're stupid,

61
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,620
Tang Pingping, you are stupid.

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,180
What did I do wrong?

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,180
Pingping.

64
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,860
Come here.

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,900
Move aside.

66
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,620
Fangning, I know

67
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,100
you have your reasons.

68
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,780
You had no choice but to run away, divorce,

69
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,380
and keep everything from Dr. Ling, am I right?

70
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,859
Thank you, Uncle Tang.

71
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,660
Fangning.

72
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,620
How are you doing? How's your health?

73
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,700
Do you want me to introduce you

74
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
to a better doctor?

75
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,740
It's alright.

76
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,980
This too shall pass.

77
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,620
How much does it cost to see a doctor? I'll pay for you.

78
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,940
I can at least help with

79
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,540
this kind of small matter.

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,070
Fangning, what's wrong with you?

81
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,260
To think that

82
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,220
your Uncle Lu

83
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,380
only has this one daughter...

84
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,420
And now, she's...

85
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,340
My heart really...

86
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,100
Lu Fangning...

87
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,100
Don't tell me you're terminally ill?

88
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,350
Are you dying?

89
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,060
-Dad, please save her!
-Shut up!

90
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,780
What terminal illness?

91
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,730
Stop talking nonsense!

92
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,380
Fangning.

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,540
I know that you're a stubborn person.

94
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,100
If it wasn't for this,

95
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,740
you wouldn't have disappeared just like that.

96
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,380
Yes.

97
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,460
Dad.

98
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,060
But she even gave birth to a baby.

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,510
Can her body take it?

100
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,060
You're terminally ill?

101
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
Why did you

102
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,660
keep such a huge matter from us?

103
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,220
That's it. That's enough!

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,700
Enough!

105
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,020
Be quiet!

106
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,770
Youyou is sleeping in the room.

107
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,460
What if the kid hears all of this?

108
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,260
Fangning, you're at the wrong this time around.

109
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,380
It's not fair to

110
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,550
Ling Rui and Youyou.

111
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,220
Exactly. Are you stupid?

112
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,140
No, you're not stupid, you're just looking for trouble.

113
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,780
Yup.

114
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,070
You disappeared right after going bankrupt

115
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,820
and what else did you do?

116
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,180
Sacrificing for love silently.

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,860
What kind of old cliche is this?

118
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,700
Did you want to

119
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,380
chase a good husband like Dr. Ling away that much?

120
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Exactly.

121
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,660
I always thought you were smarter than me.

122
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,060
Who knew you'd be like this?

123
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,350
Dad.

124
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,260
You can stop comparing us anymore.

125
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,460
We're of different levels.

126
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,780
Indeed you are.

127
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,660
Yup.

128
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,020
Fangning.

129
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,500
This matter

130
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,700
was a big blow to

131
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Dr. Ling.

132
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,100
It's hard to make up

133
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,420
for the lost affection.

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,150
You're right.

135
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,580
Dr. Ling is such a good person.

136
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,620
How could you...

137
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,660
Why is it you again?

138
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,940
If you guys want to start

139
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,420
another round of attack,

140
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,130
it should begin from Simon.

141
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,300
Can't I cut the line?

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,500
If I knew you would abandon Dr. Ling,

143
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,300
you should have just given him to me.

144
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,540
To you?

145
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,100
Who are you glaring at?

146
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
You did this to yourself.

147
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,180
Yeah. You totally asked for this.

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
Where can you find

149
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,380
such a good husband like Dr. Ling?

150
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,060
Where can you find one?

151
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,460
And you kept

152
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
such a huge secret from us.

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,060
You kept it from us.

154
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,580
Do you even

155
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,740
see us as your good friends?

156
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,220
Enough, you two...

157
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,340
Why are you scolding my mom?

158
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
This... This child...

159
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,540
Why are you scolding my mom?

160
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,690
Baby, we were chatting.

161
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,300
We were just a bit loud.

162
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
They scolded you.

163
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,540
I heard them.

164
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,910
This is you and Dr. Ling's son?

165
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,090
So cute!

166
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,700
What a little angel!

167
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:06,820
Me first.

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,220
Me too, little angel.

169
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,900
Will you give auntie a kiss?

170
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,660
Pingping.

171
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,540
You should let me have

172
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,580
a cute grandson like this too.

173
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,900
I want him. I want him.

174
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,340
Enough.

175
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,580
Enough, you two.

176
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,780
[Youyou is our child?]

177
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,820
How old is he now?

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,660
Five years old.

179
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,020
[Why didn't you tell me?]

180
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,580
[I...]

181
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,970
[I just didn't want to]

182
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,660
[disturb your life.]

183
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,970
At night,

184
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,220
both of them were too tired to move.

185
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,300
But when Harry thought of Pooh

186
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,780
and their journey across the ocean,

187
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,300
there was a voice in his head

188
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,660
that was saying,

189
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,420
I shouldn't,

190
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,380
I can't.

191
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,620
But his heart made a decision.

192
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,940
Youyou.

193
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,340
If you can't sleep,

194
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,820
do you want to chat?

195
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,380
Mom is right.

196
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,900
If you can't sleep,

197
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,580
don't force yourself to.

198
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,700
Come here.

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,460
Then...

200
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,220
What should we chat about?

201
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,500
Come, sit properly. Let mommy ask you a question.

202
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,710
You...

203
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,780
Do you really want a dad?

204
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,940
Time is precious. Stop talking nonsense.

205
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,420
What if

206
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,820
dad doesn't want us?

207
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,230
I'm so cute.

208
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,060
Of course, dad would want me.

209
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,300
As for mom,

210
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,980
you'd barely make the cut.

211
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,380
Mom.

212
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,380
If he doesn't want you,

213
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,500
I don't want him either.

214
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,660
We can just

215
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,860
change a dad.

216
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,490
Oh my.

217
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,300
Why are you so hot?

218
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,460
How did I only notice it now? Youyou.

219
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,100
Do you feel sick?

220
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,980
Yes.

221
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,900
Let's go to the hospital.

222
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,460
Okay.

223
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,780
Come on.

224
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,340
Good boy. Come.

225
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,050
Come, give mommy a hug.

226
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Hug mommy tight.

227
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,180
Good boy.

228
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,930
[Emergency]

229
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,710
Hello.

230
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,780
This is my ID.

231
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,180
Youyou, how are you feeling?

232
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
Feeling better?

233
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,060
Do you want to drink some water?

234
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,140
Youyou.

235
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,580
Youyou.

236
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,940
Youyou.

237
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,060
Youyou.

238
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,500
Hello.

239
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Can I put you down for a while?

240
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,220
Let me make the payment.

241
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,140
Okay, I won't put you down.

242
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,220
Hello.

243
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,110
Hello.

244
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,860
Sorry.

245
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,500
Youyou, you have to come down.

246
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,340
I need to take something.

247
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,220
Let me hold him.

248
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
You register first.

249
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,860
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,700
Hello.

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,220
He's having a fever.

252
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,900
All done.

253
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,060
Okay, thank you.

254
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,180
The clinic is over there. Let's go.

255
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,580
Next patient.

256
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,470
Dr. Ling.

257
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
-Hello, Dr. Ge.
-Hello.

258
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,660
The child has a fever.

259
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,860
Hi, little one.

260
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,580
Shall we take off

261
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
our masks together?

262
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,540
Okay.

263
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,100
Your relative's child?

264
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,300
He's pretty cute.

265
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,020
Little one,

266
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,860
do you feel weak?

267
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,460
Do you feel like your nose is runny?

268
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,940
When did he start

269
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,700
having the fever?

270
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,100
He only started

271
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
having a fever tonight.

272
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,500
But he actually

273
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,900
started coughing a little bit two days ago.

274
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,580
Oh.

275
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,300
He just came back

276
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,180
from overseas.

277
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,180
I was scared that he might not be used to it here,

278
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,340
so I took his temperature

279
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,300
every day.

280
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,820
-Please take a look.
-Let me have a look

281
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,580
I also noted down the medications

282
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,460
that he has taken in the past.

283
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,660
It's time to take your medicine.

284
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,620
Okay.

285
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,500
It's not a big problem.

286
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,660
He'll just need to stay in the hospital tonight for observation.

287
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,020
How did you know that

288
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,500
we...

289
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,380
Lu Yiyao called me,

290
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,140
saying Youyou was sick.

291
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,460
He had work.

292
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,390
It may be hard for you to take care of Youyou alone.

293
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm really not a

294
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,660
very competent mother.

295
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,070
Youyou is very sensible.

296
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,500
You took good care of him.

297
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,220
By the way...

298
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,500
Youyou seemed to be just joking

299
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,500
when he called you 'dad' the other day.

300
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,940
After he gets better,

301
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,380
I will tell him

302
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,180
the true relationship between you two.

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,420
Sorry, Ling Rui.

304
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,780
He is asleep now.

305
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,060
I can handle him on my own.

306
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,740
You can get back to your work.

307
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,790
Okay.

308
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,780
Isn't my mom pretty

309
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,700
when she's quiet?

310
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,180
Can you carry me up?

311
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,460
Sure.

312
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,260
I've always known that

313
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,140
you were my dad.

314
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,980
You look a lot like my plushie.

315
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,300
So, besides hugging me,

316
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,220
you can also pinch me.

317
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,580
Mom really likes

318
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,740
to pinch my face.

319
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,300
I'm very cute.

320
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,620
Yup.

321
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,740
Dad.

322
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,700
Can you stay by my side?

323
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,820
I...

324
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,860
Just now, when the doctor asked

325
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,420
whether I'm your relative's child,

326
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,100
none of you denied it.

327
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,700
I felt so sad inside.

328
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,820
Actually, I really want dad too.

329
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,060
But I don't want to make mom sad.

330
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,820
I know mom misses you too.

331
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,990
You're such a good boy.

332
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,020
His temperature is normal.

333
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
He can go home now.

334
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,390
Dr. Ling,

335
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,870
your relative's child is so cute.

336
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,380
Thank you.

337
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,590
He's my son.

338
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,060
Well... Dr. Ling...

339
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,940
Your...

340
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,340
Your son is so cute.

341
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,460
I'll get back to work.

342
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
-Okay.
-Thank you so much.

343
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,020
Dad, I want a hug!

344
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,460
Sure.

345
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,220
Here's your hug.

346
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,819
Your hug feels much safer than my mom's.

347
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:32,360
[Breakfast with Tang Ping]

348
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,299
Do you love Miss Pingping?

349
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,220
Yes!

350
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,059
Is Miss Pingping beautiful?

351
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,260
Yes!

352
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
Good. Three, two, one.

353
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,970
One more!

354
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,460
Another pose.

355
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,100
One more!

356
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,260
Now, the finger heart!

357
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,220
Okay. Really pretty.

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,100
All done. Let's start then.

359
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,700
Come.

360
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,050
You're welcome.

361
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,060
Miss Pingping.

362
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,100
Can I take a photo

363
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,700
with you alone?

364
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,380
Come.

365
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,500
Three, two, one.

366
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,660
Okay.

367
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,180
Thank you, Miss Pingping.

368
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,340
-We will always support you.
-Yup.

369
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,060
Let's do our best. Thank you.

370
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,420
The president said

371
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,460
we must have breakfast with you

372
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,780
because breakfast is cheap.

373
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,580
Then, we can

374
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,900
help you save money.

375
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,420
Having breakfast is pretty good.

376
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,540
It's just that

377
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,310
it's a bit hard to wake up for it.

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,260
Exactly. I couldn't wake up too.

379
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,340
It's all the president's fault

380
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,260
for coming up with this bad idea.

381
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,260
It's okay.

382
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,940
It's my treat today.

383
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,980
You guys enjoy the meal.

384
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,380
Have whatever you want.

385
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,710
Thank you, Miss Pingping!

386
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,420
Let's have a toast.

387
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,060
Let's raise our glasses and make a toast

388
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,820
to Miss Pingping!

389
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,860
-Okay?
-Yes!

390
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,940
Thank you, Miss Pingping.

391
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,380
Cheers!

392
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,900
Alright.

393
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,860
Delicious!

394
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,060
Really good.

395
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,260
By the way,

396
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,420
is 120 not here today?

397
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,230
I didn't see him.
-Didn't see him.

398
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,020
He's not here again?

399
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,500
Think about it. This president is the one

400
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,460
who comes up with all the ideas all the time.

401
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,580
But he's also the one

402
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,660
who's always absent.

403
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,940
He's absent because he's busy

404
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,700
with work again today.

405
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,220
Have you met the president before?

406
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,620
Ever since I joined the fan club,

407
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,740
I've never once met the president.

408
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,460
I don't even know if the president is a male or female.

409
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,860
I've never met the president either.

410
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,580
Do you think that

411
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,780
this president

412
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,420
is hiding a secret?

413
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,940
Is it because he looks really...

414
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,260
Don't say things like that.

415
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,660
It's not good to talk behind someone's back.

416
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
Okay.

417
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,220
Whether he looks good or not,

418
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,980
he is still my first fan.

419
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,620
To me,

420
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,700
he's very precious.

421
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,660
So, even if he looks very ugly,

422
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,460
I won't mind it.

423
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,260
Alright.

424
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,020
Let's start eating.

425
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,730
-Okay.
-Okay.

426
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,570
Let's start.

427
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,420
This one...

428
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,930
This looks so pretty.

429
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,100
This is so...

430
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,220
Hello.

431
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,380
You came!

432
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,060
This is my friend.

433
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,020
He's Peng Bo.

434
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,740
He is my father's personal physician.

435
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,300
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

436
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,140
So, I specifically invited him over to have a meal

437
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,420
Do you guys mind?

438
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,100
We don't mind.

439
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,780
That's great.

440
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,540
Welcome.

441
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,420
[So this is how everyone looks like.]

442
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,300
Peng Bo.

443
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,500
[This person bashed me in the chat group before.]

444
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,300
[This one.]

445
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,740
[He replies the slowest whenever]

446
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,430
[we assign ranking tasks.]

447
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,780
[And you...]

448
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,780
Peng Bo.

449
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,140
Miss Pingping.

450
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,110
Why are you calling me that?

451
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,740
Only my fans

452
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
call me that.

453
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,300
You don't have to.

454
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,900
[I want to call you that too.]

455
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,620
Okay. You can go ahead.

456
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,740
Welcome!

457
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Come. Have a seat.

458
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,860
Have a seat.

459
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Miss Pingping, let's eat.

460
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,700
Let's eat.

461
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,580
Peng Bo, I'll leave you on your own.

462
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,340
You can eat yourself.

463
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,060
Try this.

464
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,130
You've worked hard.

465
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,970
Thank you!

466
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,620
It's nothing.

467
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,700
[I want it too.]

468
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
-Thank you.
-Hurry and eat.

469
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,660
I think this must be delicious.

470
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,500
Do you know why?

471
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,100
Why?

472
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,620
Because

473
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,540
Miss Pingping

474
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
gave this to me.

475
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,420
I'll taste it first.

476
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,100
How is it?

477
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,780
Delicious!

478
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,090
It's really good!

479
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,700
[The patient of Bed 21 vomited.]

480
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,100
[I'm on leave today.]

481
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,700
[Is it your first time seeing]

482
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,780
[patients vomiting after having anesthesia?]

483
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,940
[Look for a nurse at the nurse counter.]

484
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,460
[Mengmeng is on duty today.]

485
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,500
[She's ignoring me.]

486
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,660
[Dr. Peng, she's breaking up with me.]

487
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,580
[So, this is the main point?]

488
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,580
[Dr. Peng.]

489
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,460
[You finally got it right.]

490
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,020
[Help me.]

491
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,860
[I gave everyone]

492
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,060
[a piece of toast.]

493
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,420
[This piece is yours.]

494
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,020
[I don't know]

495
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
[what flavors you like,]

496
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,460
[so I took a bit of everything.]

497
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,580
[Hope to see you next time.]

498
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,740
[Why are you ignoring me?]

499
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,860
[Are you having constipation?]

500
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,090
[Even you're leaving me.]

501
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,030
[I'm such a poor thing.]

502
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,340
[Bed 21 is fine.]

503
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
[Don't be too worried.]

504
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,420
[Mengmeng is still ignoring me.]

505
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,820
[Okay?]

506
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,100
[I'll tell Ling Rui]

507
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,260
[that your brain is constipated.]

508
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,370
[Ling Rui?]

509
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,230
Goodbye.

510
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,220
Remember to take your phones.

511
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,910
Your phones.

512
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,220
Goodbye.

513
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,980
Okay.

514
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,300
Goodbye.

515
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,500
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

516
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:17,910
Goodbye.

517
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,140
Goodbye.

518
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,300
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

519
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,220
-Goodbye, Miss Pingping.
-Goodbye.

520
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,140
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

521
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,260
Goodbye.

522
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,940
Goodbye.

523
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,190
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

524
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,260
Goodbye.

525
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,100
Miss Pingping.

526
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,580
Goodbye.

527
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,260
Goodbye.

528
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,940
We'll come again next time

529
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,540
to your birthday party.

530
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Sure. Goodbye.

531
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,140
-Okay.
-Bye.

532
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,260
Goodbye, Miss Pingping.

533
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,780
Goodbye.

534
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
[Tell Ling Rui?]

535
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
[Caramel Apple 120?]

536
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,700
[Peng Bo?]

537
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,180
Stop there, Peng Bo!

538
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,180
Stop!

539
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,290
Stop there, Peng Bo!

540
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,900
You!

541
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,260
Stop there!

542
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,860
Are you okay?

543
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,100
Are you okay?

544
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,700
Does it hurt?

545
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,820
It hurts!

546
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,180
Sorry... Sorry...

547
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,740
-It hurts.
-I...

548
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,660
Let me have a look.

549
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,980
Caramel Apple 120.

550
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,940
It's not me.

551
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,460
What do you mean it's not you?

552
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,420
How did you know

553
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,170
Caramel Apple 120

554
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,010
was a person?

555
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,820
No...

556
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
Not a person...

557
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,900
120...

558
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,980
Should I call 120 for you?

559
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,140
Why don't you have a check at the hospital?

560
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,460
Give me your phone.

561
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,140
No way.

562
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,220
Give it to me.

563
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,900
No way.

564
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,980
Hold still.

565
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,340
Let me see

566
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,270
whether you're

567
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,260
Caramel Apple 120?

568
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,500
Please give me back my phone.

569
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,140
Nope.

570
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,780
No. No.

571
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,380
Give it back to me.

572
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,570
Nope.

573
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,220
No.

574
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,180
Are you angry? Are you angry?

575
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,100
Enough.

576
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,340
Stop joking around.

577
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm not joking around.

578
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,460
Have a look at yourself now.

579
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,940
What's wrong?

580
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,380
You are an idol.

581
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,140
You are an artist.

582
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,980
Aren't you scared of the paparazzi?

583
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,260
Am I right?

584
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,740
Do you think you're lack scandals?

585
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,940
Would you be able to do well

586
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,980
in your showbiz career?

587
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,890
Stick your foot out.

588
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,940
That one.

589
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,780
You're a celebrity.

590
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,950
You're an artist.

591
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,780
You need to be careful next time.

592
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,980
Okay.

593
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,950
Be good.

594
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,580
Be careful.

595
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,510
Caramel Apple 120...

596
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,190
It's you.

597
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,380
I really shouldn't have

598
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,820
let Lu Fangning read those novels.

599
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,380
She's living her life

600
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,420
as if it's a novel.

601
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,980
The beginning...

602
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,820
[Deadlift.]

603
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,020
[Deadlift, no problem.]

604
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,260
What a marvelous beginning!

605
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,300
Next...

606
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,180
[Chapter Two]

607
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
A marvelous experience.

608
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,150
[Lu Yiyao]

609
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,180
I, Lu Youyou, am officially informing you

610
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,860
that from now on,

611
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,540
I don't need you anymore.

612
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,380
Dad,

613
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,130
thank you for your company for the past five years.

614
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,220
But now I have found

615
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,300
my real-life dad.

616
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,940
What?

617
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,710
You're asking

618
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,700
whether I'm satisfied with my dad?

619
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,180
Make a guess.

620
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,220
Dad. Dad. Dad.

621
00:29:50,460 --> 00:30:01,540
Dad. Dad. Dad.

622
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,060
Dad. Dad. Dad.

623
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,650
[Can we meet?]

624
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,580
Dad. Dad. Dad.

625
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,220
Sorry.

626
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,060
I'm really sorry.

627
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,860
Sit down.

628
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,340
It's okay.

629
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,300
Uhm...

630
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,790
Do you want something to drink?

631
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,060
Excuse me.

632
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,540
One hot Americano, please.

633
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,340
Thank you.

634
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,740
Okay. Please wait for a while.

635
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,740
Uhm...

636
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,180
Ling Rui.

637
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,780
I heard Youyou called you 'dad'.

638
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,500
He's much smarter and sensitive

639
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,540
than I imagined.

640
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,420
Last night,

641
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,740
I watched him holding that doll

642
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,700
and kept calling it 'dad, dad'.

643
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,260
I was wrong

644
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
about Youyou's matter.

645
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,700
I...

646
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,940
I was too full of myself.

647
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,300
And because of that,

648
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,220
I've brought

649
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,670
nothing but scars and regrets

650
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,740
to you and Youyou.

651
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,060
I'm sorry.

652
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,700
Have a seat first.

653
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,780
It's okay. I'm more comfortable like this.

654
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,060
Here's your hot Americano.

655
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,060
Thank you.

656
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,980
I can try to

657
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,420
digest my emotions.

658
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,060
But Youyou is just a kid.

659
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,940
For the past five years,

660
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,740
he had to

661
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,820
live a life without a father.

662
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,020
Ling Rui.

663
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,380
I'm really sorry.

664
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,140
I will find a way to make amends.

665
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,490
I will make amends

666
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,580
for your father-son relationship.

667
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,940
How do you plan to make amends?

668
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,020
I have a way

669
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,620
we can make up for what we've lost over the past five years.

670
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
What's that?

671
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,380
I hope you can give me

672
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,340
Youyou's custody.

673
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,460
No way.

674
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,940
No... I mean...

675
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,900
Your business is just starting.

676
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,610
Plus, you're overseas most of the time.

677
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,860
The nature of my job

678
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,180
and living environment

679
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,780
is more suitable to raise a child

680
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,140
compared to yours at the moment.

681
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:17,940
Besides,

682
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,940
having a child with you always

683
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,980
makes it hard for you to find a boyfriend.

684
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,820
Your youth is wasted just like that.

685
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,420
I thought it through.

686
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,140
This is the best solution

687
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,980
at the moment.

688
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,820
I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

689
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,660
Ling Rui, I swear

690
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,820
I'm not looking for someone.

691
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,260
I will never do that.

692
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,660
I...

693
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,510
Ling Rui, you have no idea.

694
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,940
Youyou is at this age

695
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,780
where even dogs hate him.

696
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,620
You wouldn't want

697
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,490
to see him every day.

698
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,060
You would eventually lose

699
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,860
your love for him.

700
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,660
How about

701
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,010
you two meet more often?

702
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,140
Meet each other more.

703
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,100
Meet each other a lot.

704
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,460
One week each month.

705
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,420
Half a month.

706
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,660
Meet three-quarters of a month.

707
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,930
How about that?

708
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,620
Don't you have to

709
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,740
go back abroad very soon?

710
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,620
I won't go back.

711
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,260
I'll take root in my motherland and serve my country.

712
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,020
We don't live together.

713
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,380
My mother

714
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,820
and aunts are also old now.

715
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,900
It's inconvenient for them to move around.

716
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,140
I...

717
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,899
I'll deliver him to your doorstep.

718
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,580
I'll deliver Lu Youyou to your doorstep.

719
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,250
I'll personally

720
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,660
pack and deliver Lu Youyou to your doorstep.

721
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,500
Ling Rui.

722
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,820
Think about it.

723
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,500
Think carefully about it.

724
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,379
We really can't bring this to court.

725
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,140
Parents going against each other in a lawsuit

726
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,620
will only bring a negative impact

727
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,689
to our child's growth

728
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:46,060
and also his future.

729
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,939
I'll wait for you at home.

730
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,590
If you have nothing important to say, you can leave.

731
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,500
Peng Bo, my friend.

732
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,820
Where's your phone?

733
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,340
Who is this romantic person?

734
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,220
Which century are you living in?

735
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,380
You're still using

736
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,780
such an ancient tool of communication.

737
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,020
Oh my goodness.

738
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,710
Have a look.

739
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,460
Open it.

740
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,660
Yang, let me tell you.

741
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,870
I've understood the confusion

742
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,140
that you told me about last time.

743
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,550
Okay.

744
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,740
So?

745
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,140
So I made an arrangement.

746
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,380
From today onwards,

747
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,940
you and Nurse Liu Mengmeng's shifts

748
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,140
are all separated.

749
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,540
In our department,

750
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,780
either you or she will be here at a time.

751
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,700
Never together.

752
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,180
Dr. Peng.

753
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,100
I give you three seconds

754
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,230
to get out of my sight.

755
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,180
If you don't leave,

756
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
-I'll tell her that -Understand!

757
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,980
Everything

758
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,380
was just a scheme that you begged me

759
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,580
to separate her from you.

760
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,960
[To, Peng Bo. Contains bombs.]

761
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,860
[Your phone is with me.]

762
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,060
[But I don't know the password.]

763
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,220
[But I can try.]

764
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,580
[My birthday.]

765
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,620
[The day I acted for the first time.]

766
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,300
[The number of views]

767
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,020
[of my first drama.]

768
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,380
[After trying them all out,]

769
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,820
[I'll go through all your contacts]

770
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,020
[and tell them]

771
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,340
[that you are my 120.]

772
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,460
[You know how to contact me.]

773
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
How am I supposed to contact you?

774
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,140
All the numbers are on my phone.

775
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,340
[Tell him that his dad is a bastard]

776
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,700
[and he must choose mommy.]

777
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,180
[No, I can't.]

778
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,060
[I can't bring this]

779
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,260
[to the child.]

780
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,110
[Or I can just]

781
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,260
[send Lu Youyou back abroad]

782
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,780
[and get the old man to hide him.]

783
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,900
[No, I can't.]

784
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,340
[I can't do this kind of thing anymore.]

785
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,180
[In that case, I can only...]

786
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,340
Mom, I'm so handsome.

787
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,620
Are you mesmerized by me?

788
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,390
Baby.

789
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,740
What happened?

790
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,180
I'll have to ask you

791
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,260
to bear a short while for mommy.

792
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,980
I need your help to show

793
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,910
how great mommy is.

794
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,420
Mom, what are you talking about?

795
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,260
Youyou.

796
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,260
Do you want to know

797
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,060
how to please the three grandmas?

798
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,700
Yes!

799
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,620
Then, let me tell you.

800
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
Just show them

801
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,700
what a true devil you are.

802
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,830
Cry and throw tantrums.

803
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,020
No matter what they ask you to do,

804
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,900
you have to say 'no, no, no.'

805
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,420
No one would like

806
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,820
such a child.

807
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,500
This is what you don't understand.

808
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,070
Let me tell you.

809
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,930
You haven't been back for too long.

810
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:00,860
It is the difference

811
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,180
between Chinese and Western culture.

812
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,460
You always liked watching the news, don't you?

813
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,660
The grandmas here

814
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,290
love kids who cry, throw tantrums,

815
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,900
who are lively and rebellious.

816
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,990
This can stimulate

817
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,380
their motherly love.

818
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,060
Look.

819
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,140
You met Auntie Tang Ping before, didn't you?

820
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,690
Wasn't she just stupid and loud?

821
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,300
Am I right?

822
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,660
But doesn't mom still

823
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,460
accept,

824
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,940
tolerate and love her?

825
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,570
We have to allow everyone

826
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,020
to have different preferences.

827
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,060
Okay?

828
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,700
Okay!

829
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,700
Not okay...

830
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,820
Okay...

831
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,420
Not okay...

832
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,020
Are you okay with it or not?

833
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,540
Are you fooling me around?

834
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,690
I guess it really isn't okay.

835
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,740
How about we both take a step back?

836
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,700
Let's compromise.

837
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,580
Just promise me

838
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,300
that you'll do three things.

839
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Three things?

840
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,820
Seventy thousand.

841
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,060
Pass.

842
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,940
Pass?

843
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,260
Hurry, your turn.

844
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,660
Forty thousand.

845
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,900
I won!

846
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,540
-Be gentle.
-I...

847
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,300
Sorry. Sorry.

848
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,460
I was just excited.

849
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,220
Did you forget that I have pharyngitis?

850
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,820
-I can't eat chili.
-I don't care.

851
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,780
Why didn't you say anything

852
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
when you forced me to eat it just now?

853
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,860
I can't eat it.

854
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,500
I'm still coughing.

855
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,220
I don't care. You have to eat it.

856
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,380
Not too much.

857
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,180
Ling Rui!

858
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,660
Yes.

859
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,790
They're bullying me.

860
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,860
Go and pour me a glass of water.

861
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,180
They're getting me to eat chili.

862
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,220
-Okay.
-Pour me a glass of water.

863
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,100
So much chili!

864
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm coming.

865
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,860
How am I supposed to eat them?

866
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,180
I'll be coughing mad eating these.

867
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,180
Hurry and eat them.

868
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,390
I want to witness

869
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,540
this historical moment.

870
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,060
Hurry and get me some water.

871
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,220
Water is coming.

872
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,020
Sister-in-law.

873
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,070
-I'm not eating them.
-Hurry up.

874
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,700
No can do.

875
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,170
I'm not eating.

876
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,260
I need to drink water.

877
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,300
If you keep acting like this,

878
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,940
then we'll...

879
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,420
We'll draw your face.

880
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,020
I'll draw for you.

881
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,540
You owe me one.

882
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,140
Can I owe it?

883
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,180
You two are so shameless.

884
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,260
Next time, let's not

885
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,500
do eat chili then.

886
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,820
Keep your voice down.

887
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,620
Who is it?

888
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,060
I'll get it.

889
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,900
Come.

890
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,540
One more round.

891
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,650
Dad!

892
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,470
-What's wrong with you two?
-Youyou.

893
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,790
Where's your mom?

894
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,900
Why didn't she come?

895
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,180
Didn't she say home delivery?

896
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,220
Mom sent me here.

897
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,830
There's a kid.

898
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,460
-Then, she left.
-Who is he?

899
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:09,860
Who came?

900
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,900
We already know each other so well.

901
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,460
We don't need her introduction.

902
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,700
Good boy.

903
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,580
Go in.

904
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,590
Who is this?

905
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,460
A little baby.

906
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,140
This is actually...

907
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,860
[First thing.]

908
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,340
Scream as soon as you enter the house.

909
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,300
What happened?

910
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,140
What's wrong？

911
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,660
Are you sick?

912
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,700
[Mom only asked me to scream.]

913
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,580
[She never set the reason as to why I scream.]

914
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,420
How beautiful!

915
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,020
Youyou saw this house

916
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,180
and the three grandmas.

917
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,940
I think you are all so beautiful!

918
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,150
So good with his words.

919
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,260
This kid.

920
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,500
Are you auntie?

921
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,980
You're so young.

922
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,180
I should call you Sis.

923
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,620
Sis!

924
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,180
Then, you two must be Grannies,

925
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,740
am I right?

926
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,270
Yes, we are.

927
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,580
You're so beautiful too!

928
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
Thank you.

929
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,220
I just

930
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,190
got my hair done two days ago.

931
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,670
Of course, I'm pretty.

932
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,230
This child sure has an eye for beauty.

933
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,380
It's really rare.

934
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,430
He's so cute.
-This is...

935
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,980
So cute.

936
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,020
So cute.

937
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,060
I want to keep him home.

938
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,780
Where did you get this baby?

939
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,180
-Big sister!
-How about you sit here?

940
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,380
So cute.

941
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,260
How come he looks kind of familiar?

942
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,630
Look at all the kids.

943
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,780
Aren't they all the same?

944
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,780
It's still very rare

945
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,030
to see such a cute child.

946
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,180
[Second thing.]

947
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,380
"Upside down".

948
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,460
After entering the house,

949
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,940
create a mess and turn the house upside down.

950
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,620
Okay?

951
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,500
It's not good

952
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,580
to touch other people's stuff

953
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,890
when you're in their house.

954
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,860
You're right.

955
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,180
Then, you can try to hold it in first.

956
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,140
Go into the house and

957
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,180
find a corner that you like.

958
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,450
Just turn that corner upside down.

959
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,190
Okay?

960
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,810
What did he find?

961
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,500
What is he doing?

962
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,820
What's going on?

963
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,060
It's normal for kids

964
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,900
to pull out all the things at home.

965
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,860
It's just curiosity.

966
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,340
This...

967
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,220
He's putting them back.

968
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,940
That's new.

969
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,180
It's the first time I see a kid

970
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,140
tidying up

971
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,340
after creating a mess.

972
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,220
What do you mean by 'first time'?

973
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,060
Well...

974
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,220
Ling Rui was like this when he was young.

975
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,310
He couldn't bear

976
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,380
even the slightest mess in his room.

977
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,140
Am I right?

978
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,260
Ling Rui.

979
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,900
Where did you pick up

980
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,740
such a treasure?

981
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,460
The two of them really do look kind of alike.

982
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,140
Yeah.

983
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,980
I don't count on you

984
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,020
to give me

985
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,660
such a precious grandson.

986
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,580
Youyou.

987
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,420
It's almost mealtime.

988
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,540
What do you want to eat?

989
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,740
[That was fast. We're at this time now?]

990
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,070
Third thing.

991
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,820
When grandmas ask you what you want to eat,

992
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,700
say you don't want to eat.

993
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,940
You don't want anything.

994
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,810
You only want pizza,

995
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,100
burger, fried chicken, and fries.

996
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,260
Pizza, burger, fried chicken and fries.

997
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,460
That's easy. I'll go and buy them.

998
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,180
-The soup is coming.
-Why did

999
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:38,900
she get all these

1000
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,820
junk foods for him?

1001
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,180
Soup is here. Soup is here.

1002
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,500
The soup is here.

1003
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,870
Here comes the soup.

1004
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,260
Kid, drink the soup first.

1005
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,100
Finish the soup

1006
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,500
and then, you can eat these junk foods.

1007
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,460
Did you hear me?

1008
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,700
I don't want to.

1009
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,310
Nevermind then.

1010
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,220
Youyou said

1011
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,460
he wants to eat these junk foods.

1012
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,780
Kids love these.

1013
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,940
Come.

1014
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,010
Have some vegetables

1015
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,220
so you can balance your diet.

1016
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,580
I don't want to.

1017
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,910
You don't want to?

1018
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,540
Youyou.

1019
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,180
I made these dishes myself.

1020
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,250
Have a taste.

1021
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,790
No!

1022
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,980
One, two, three, chew.

1023
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,470
Good boy.

1024
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,260
-Chew, chew.
-He's eating vegetables now.

1025
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,780
Keep chewing.

1026
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,060
Another sip of the soup.

1027
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,180
-What a good boy.
-Good boy.

1028
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,980
Really good.

1029
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,420
Have some veggie after the soup.

1030
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,820
Very good.

1031
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,460
Kid.

1032
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,380
Let's not eat these junk foods

1033
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,220
anymore today.

1034
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,340
Okay?

1035
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,150
Okay?

1036
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,060
Give it to Grannie.

1037
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,470
Very good.

1038
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,700
If you can not eat them today,

1039
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,700
you can

1040
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,900
not eat them forever.

1041
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,710
Okay?

1042
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,900
I won't eat them anymore.

1043
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,030
Nothing tastes better

1044
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,540
than the dishes made by dad.

1045
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,620
Exactly!

1046
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,380
-Good boy.
-Dad?
