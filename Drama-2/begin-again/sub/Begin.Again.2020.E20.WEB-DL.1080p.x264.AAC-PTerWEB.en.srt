from the moment I met you.

13
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,890
That's because you're

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,890
the best choice.

15
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,330
A person like me

Never be too kind to yourself.

194
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,090
Yes, Ms. Lu.

195
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,610
Don't be too kind to me too.

196
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,770
Call me if there's an emergency.

197
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,370
Unless it's at night.

198
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,010
I wonder if Ling Rui

199
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,130
likes the clothes Cai Siyu prepared

200
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,250
for me this time.

201
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,640
I don't care. I'll just change a style.

202
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,850
Which pajamas should I take?

203
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,250
This one is good.

204
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,650
No, no.

205
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,490
What am I thinking?

206
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,970
It's a serious business trip.

207
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,330
You…

208
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,120
Would you like some water?

209
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,370
No, thanks.

210
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,850
You've packed up your things?

211
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,490
Yes.

212
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,300
I quite look forward to it.

213
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,450
Me too.

214
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,090
Actually some things are not necessary.

215
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,610
The necessities are prepared well already there.

216
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,560
I've prepared the necessities well.

217
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,690
Me too.

218
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,010
-Let's go to sleep.
-Turn the light off.

219
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,330
I mean.

220
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,290
-It's time.
-Yeah.

221
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,410
It's late now.

222
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,490
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,570
I said it too simply just now.

224
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,410
Have… Have an early rest.

225
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,090
-Good night.
-Good night.

226
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,970
See you tomorrow.

227
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,690
See you tomorrow.

228
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,960
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

229
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,290
Ling Rui.

230
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,210
Is this your hometown?

231
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,930
Yes.

232
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,570
Good.

233
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,730
Golden rice field.

234
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,640
Golden waves of barley.

235
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,090
Oh, rice fields.

236
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,810
They are not in season yet.

237
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,890
It doesn't matter.

238
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,770
It looks good this way, too.

239
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,610
Beautiful.

240
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,010
Well.

241
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,810
How about this?

242
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,130
Yes.

243
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,890
Where?

244
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,490
Here.

245
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,890
The color might have been edited.

246
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,610
But you can see the flowers.

247
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,570
You see here, and here.

248
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,570
The flowers look nice.

249
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,010
It's okay. It's okay.

250
00:13:59,210 --> 00:13:59,770
We're not here

251
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,690
for sightseeing anyway.

252
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,010
We can photoshop the pictures anyway.

253
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,130
All right. Let's go.

254
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,850
But,

255
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,640
we seem to have got off the bus early.

256
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,480
Right.

257
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,690
We got off one stop earlier.

258
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,850
Let's wait for the next bus then.

259
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,090
There are only two scheduled buses here.

260
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,970
That was the last scheduled bus.

261
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,330
I'll call a taxi.

262
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,570
You can't get a taxi here.

263
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,810
But it's fine.

264
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
We can take a

265
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,410
free ride from the villagers.

266
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,570
Free ride.

267
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,090
That's nice.

268
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,050
I've never taken a

269
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,010
free ride in my life.

270
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,450
That's good.

271
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,960
Sir.

272
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,650
Yeah.

273
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,930
Can you give us a free ride?

274
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,250
Our destination is the village ahead.

275
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,250
All right, no problem.

276
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,250
Okay.

277
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,010
Sir.

278
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,970
Can you

279
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,250
put those two

280
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,650
down first?

281
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,170
What?

282
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,410
The two cuties.

283
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,570
The two sheep.

284
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,650
How about this?

285
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,130
I'll buy them, but I won't take them.

286
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,250
So you can tie them to the roadside.

287
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,930
And you can

288
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,010
pick them up later.

289
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,010
Are you insane?

290
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,850
You can name a price.

291
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,290
Double or triple is all fine.

292
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,450
No way. No way.

293
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,530
I won't take you.

294
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,370
You can walk there.

295
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,370
Go ahead. Go ahead.

296
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,650
It's okay, we can wait.

297
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,610
But Ling Rui,

298
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,890
we've been waiting for so long.

299
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,650
Ling Rui?

300
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,770
Are you Dr. Ling?

301
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,930
Yeah, that's me.

302
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,490
You know me?

303
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,490
Of course.

304
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,690
Come on, get on.

305
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,920
I'll put the goats down.

306
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,730
There is no need.

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,090
I'm sorry for what I said.

308
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,330
We'll sit here together.

309
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,290
Come on, get on.

310
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,570
-So cute.
-Let's go.

311
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,570
Are you okay?

312
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,090
Sit still, Dr. Ling.

313
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,810
Okay.

314
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,720
Let's go.

315
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,370
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

316
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,760
Little White.

317
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,530
So cute.

318
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,370
You're so cute.

319
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,210
Hello.

320
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,090
Are you scared?

321
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,170
They seem to be more scared than I am.

322
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,650
It's okay.

323
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,680
You can touch them, here.

324
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,490
Be good, be good.

325
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,010
They are very gentle.

326
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,450
You can try it.

327
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,810
Why don't you feed it with this?

328
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,530
Little White.

329
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,690
Be good.

330
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:39,730
It's eating.

331
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,610
Here you are, Little Black.

332
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,730
Let's take a picture.

333
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,170
Okay.

334
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:00,930
Here we are.

335
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,730
You first.

336
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,410
Okay.

337
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:03,930
Be careful.

338
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,770
Watch out.

339
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,850
Thank you, sir.

340
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,970
It's okay.

341
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,250
Let me take it.

342
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,130
Dr. Ling.

343
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,970
We'll take our leave then.

344
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,450
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

345
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,170
You're welcome.

346
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,370
I'll come to visit you in my spare time.

347
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,000
All right.

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,240
Take care, bye-bye.

349
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,000
You're welcome. You're welcome.

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,690
Bye-bye, Little Black and Little White.

351
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:20,890
Go ahead.

352
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,210
How are you feeling?

353
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm fine.

354
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,279
So,

355
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,090
we're officially in your hometown now?

356
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:32,760
Yes.

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,410
But it looks as if

358
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,490
it's going to rain.

359
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,730
Never mind.

360
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,970
There is always sunny rain here.

361
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:43,610
Okay.

362
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,890
Let's go.

363
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,050
Careful.

364
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,250
Hello, is there anyone?

365
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,050
We want to stay here.

366
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,810
How many of you?

367
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,090
We have a booking.

368
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,050
Two rooms.

369
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,930
I want the best

370
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,770
rooms here.

371
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,520
Your suites.

372
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,810
There are not many rooms left.

373
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,090
Only a double room.

374
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,730
Don't look at him.

375
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,690
All couples live in one room here.

376
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,650
We started this year.

377
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,770
There wouldn't be a hotel for you

378
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,050
if you came earlier.

379
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,890
Let's go.

380
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,330
How about taking a look first?

381
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,330
This way.

382
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,890
Mediterranean Pastoral Suite.

383
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,410
Take a look.

384
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,690
Beautiful, isn't it? This is the best.

385
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,730
The sofa.

386
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,130
Pretty, isn't it?

387
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,210
The furniture here

388
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,170
was picked by me.

389
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,210
It's pirated.

390
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,170
What?

391
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,130
My mom bought them from a big supermarket.

392
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,210
It's expensive!

393
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,330
It's just some furniture, okay?

394
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,290
So meddlesome.

395
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,090
I'm not being meddlesome.

396
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,490
This is

397
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,330
the Inspiration Series

398
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,050
imported by our shopping mall in 2018.

399
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,970
I'll not tell you

400
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,890
the product number.

401
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,490
You won't understand anyway.

402
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,010
Little girl, where did you buy the sofa?

403
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,250
Tell me the address.

404
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,850
I'll go sue them.

405
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,610
Why are you so troublesome?

406
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,570
You're finding faults with me.

407
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,650
You want a discount?

408
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,330
We don't do that here.

409
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,010
You can leave if you're not satisfied.

410
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,810
Little girl.

411
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,370
She does not mean that.

412
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,770
You must be scared.

413
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,130
There is only one hotel here.

414
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,330
You'll have to sleep on the street if you don't like it here.

415
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,450
You rascal!

416
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,490
Why are you here?

417
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,530
I told you to stay at the counter.

418
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,650
What if Dr. Ling comes

419
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,970
and can't see us?

420
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,010
Sister Gu.

421
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,050
Ling Rui?

422
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,490
Why didn't you tell me

423
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,370
so I could go pick you up?

424
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,330
It's okay.

425
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,530
Come here.

426
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,330
You are Brother Ling Rui?

427
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,170
She must be Xiaoying.

428
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:12,770
Yes.

429
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,850
You were so little the last time I saw you.

430
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,410
Now you've grown so tall.

431
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,450
Brother Ling Rui.

432
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,730
I'll have the senior high school entrance exam next year.

433
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,130
Please enlighten my brain.

434
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,210
No way,

435
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,390
he is mine.

436
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,250
Who are you?

437
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,090
How can you be so rude?

438
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,130
Stay here.

439
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,770
Ling Rui, this is?

440
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,470
This is my wife.

441
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,570
Lu Fangning.

442
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,090
You bring your wife here?

443
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,930
Good, good.

444
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,050
Mrs. Ling.

445
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,250
If you don't like

446
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,010
the room,

447
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,050
I can change it for you.

448
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,610
And this, pirated.

449
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,490
I'm so embarrassed. I'll change it tomorrow.

450
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,810
I'll give you a new one.

451
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,170
Ling Rui, come to see this room.

452
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,050
Okay.

453
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,330
Knowing you're coming back,

454
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:00,890
I've prepared

455
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,170
the biggest room for you.

456
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,730
The bedsheet

457
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,850
and the quilt cover are new.

458
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,370
Thanks, Sister Gu.

459
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,720
Mrs. Ling, are you satisfied?

460
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm quite satisfied.

461
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,370
Thanks, Sister Gu and Xiaoying.

462
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,530
That's great.

463
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,050
You can take a rest here.

464
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,490
We'll not bother you then.

465
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,170
-Okay.
-Thank you.

466
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,170
-Okay.
-Um…

467
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,810
Brother Ling Rui, enlighten me.

468
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,050
Let's go.

469
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,850
What's wrong?

470
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,730
I'm wondering

471
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,290
what magic you've

472
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,490
cast on to the people here,

473
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,250
making them so

474
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,890
obsessed with you?

475
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,370
Aren't you tired after a day of the ride?

476
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,250
No.

477
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,170
It's nice to see

478
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,050
your childhood hometown.

479
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,570
This is actually

480
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,490
a normal town here.

481
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,730
Less prosperity and buzz

482
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,610
compared with big cities.

483
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,170
But every time

484
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,050
I come back,

485
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,650
I gain inner peace.

486
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,370
It's quite comfortable here.

487
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,850
-What are they selling?
-Crabs.

488
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,090
Miss, take a look at the crabs.

489
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,050
How about we buy some

490
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,930
for dinner tonight?

491
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,730
-Okay.
-Dr. Ling.

492
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,960
You don't have to buy.

493
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,040
I'll send you

494
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,090
some cooked ones tonight.

495
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,010
You live in Sister Gu's hotel, right?

496
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,050
It's okay, we can buy them ourselves.

497
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,370
No, I insist.

498
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:38,850
Just go.

499
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,650
Go have fun.

500
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,570
I'll send them to you tonight.

501
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,200
Thank you.

502
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,930
Never mind.

503
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,570
All right, you two go have fun.

504
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,370
Careful, Dr. Ling.

505
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,210
All right, thank you.

506
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,930
You're welcome.

507
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,850
You're such an idol here.

508
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,690
How can you be so adorable?

509
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,530
I just can't believe it.

510
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,290
What?

511
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,970
Let me have a try.

512
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,410
Ling Rui. I'm thirsty.

513
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,290
Dr. Ling.

514
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,250
Have some water.

515
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,570
Here you are. The water.

516
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,520
Uncle Liu.

517
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,360
It's okay.

518
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,290
We can buy it.

519
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,130
Hold this. Hold this.

520
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,250
Your wife is so pretty.

521
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,010
I need just one bottle.

522
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,730
Thank you, thank you.

523
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,930
Take it.

524
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,050
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

525
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,410
It's nothing.

526
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:13,730
Bye-bye.

527
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,330
Everyone here

528
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,930
looks up to you.

529
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,370
I don't believe that.

530
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,130
Will dogs even listen to you here?

531
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,890
-A dog!
-It's okay.

532
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,610
Dog!

533
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,570
Don't be afraid.

534
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,250
-It's okay, it's okay. Don't be scared.
-It's coming

535
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,330
It's coming, it's coming.

536
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,410
It's okay.

537
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,490
It's coming, it's coming.

538
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,850
Sit down, sit down.

539
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,320
It's quite good. Are you going to come down?

540
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,160
No.

541
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,730
Then let's go.

542
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,450
Ling Rui, you're back?

543
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:53,850
Hello.

544
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,200
Hello.

545
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,490
-You're back?
-Yes.

546
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,130
I'm back.

547
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,330
-Ling Rui.
-Hello, Sister Zhang.

548
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,610
-Ling Rui, you're back.
-Hi, Uncle Zhou.

549
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,110
Hello, Uncle Zhou.

550
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,620
Do you want sugar-coated haws?

551
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,530
You want sugar-coated haws?

552
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,010
No, no.

553
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,090
Ling Rui is back.

554
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,730
Hello, hello.

555
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,490
Your wife is pretty.

556
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,450
Hello, Dr. Ling.

557
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,010
Hello, hello.

558
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,470
[Flower Room]

559
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,090
Are you going to take a rest?

560
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,170
I'll go to see

561
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,130
if there is anything to eat.

562
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,810
No.

563
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,250
Be good.

564
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,690
No way.

565
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:32,850
Be good.

566
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,570
I won't.

567
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,690
All right, you must first tell me

568
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,290
what the heck

569
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,570
have you done here?

570
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,090
Why is everyone

571
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,930
treating you so well?

572
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,090
They probably want to carry you up

573
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,690
and parade through the town.

574
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,890
Why are you smiling?

575
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,010
Before this, someone would send me

576
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,200
whatever I need.

577
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,290
Now it's just one question

578
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,450
and there's no answer?

579
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,170
Let me tell you.

580
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,730
Someone really came.

581
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,810
You can ask her.

582
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,810
All right.

583
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,360
I'm leaving.

584
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,810
Okay.

585
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,210
Smell good?

586
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,450
Are they for me?

587
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,050
No.

588
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,930
All right, go ahead.

589
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,090
But after I tell you,

590
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,490
you should do me

591
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,490
a little favor.

592
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,410
You're even asking for something.

593
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:21,890
Sure.

594
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,410
Brother Ling Rui

595
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,890
was the first provincial top scholar

596
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,010
from our town.

597
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,770
My teachers always say

598
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,290
he is the pride of the town,

599
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,560
and an unprecedented

600
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,730
genius.

601
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,530
Yes.

602
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,610
That is true.

603
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,250
And,

604
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,050
Brother Ling Rui is extremely filial.

605
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,250
I heard that brother Ling Rui's mother,

606
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,320
Aunt Zhu,

607
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,730
once had depression.

608
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,930
It was brother Ling Rui

609
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,890
who took care of her.

610
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,970
But he still was able

611
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,370
to become the top scholar in the province.

612
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,330
Depression?

613
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,170
Yes.

614
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,930
He contacted a big hospital

615
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,880
and established a medical station in the town.

616
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,650
He helped many people cure their diseases.

617
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,850
And,

618
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,730
he comes here every year

619
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,760
to see the sick.

620
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,970
He is so awesome.

621
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,490
He indeed is.

622
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,970
I'm done.

623
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,810
Are you helping me or not?

624
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,450
Say it. What do you want?

625
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,610
Writing your homework is not okay.

626
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,250
Help me to secretly take

627
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,130
Brother Ling Rui's favorite thing

628
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,250
for me.

629
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,050
Maybe a pencil case

630
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,490
or a book.

631
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,080
I'll take it as my lucky charm.

632
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,170
I just might be in the top three

633
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,170
in next year's senior high school

634
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,130
entrance exam.

635
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,010
Usually,

636
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,370
I'm a clean freak.

637
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,650
But, show me your hand.

638
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,330
Brother Ling Rui likes

639
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,010
me the most.

640
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,290
No.

641
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:41,770
Wait.

642
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,370
Hey!

643
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,930
I don't want your hand.

644
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,890
Love you.

645
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,410
Well…

646
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,890
Ling Rui, if you feel

647
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,080
uncomfortable this way.

648
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,600
I'll go to another room.

649
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,330
It's okay.

650
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,010
It's fine.

651
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,450
We've been on a trip the whole day.

652
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,730
Very tired.

653
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,330
I have to go to the health center

654
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,650
tomorrow morning.

655
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,730
Why don't I sleep first?

656
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,210
Okay.

657
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,810
Good night.

658
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,170
Good night.

659
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,210
Um…

660
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,770
Ling Rui.

661
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,530
Yes.

662
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,210
Are you really tired?

663
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,450
Actually…

664
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm not that tired.

665
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,010
Me either.

666
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,570
Then…

667
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,970
How about we go ahead

668
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,170
and get prepared?

669
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,250
Prepare what?

670
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,410
Scented candle?

671
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,320
I didn't bring that.

672
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,410
Wine?

673
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,530
No wine.

674
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,850
How come I didn't prepare anything?

675
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:23,690
Actually,

676
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,970
there are somethings

677
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,730
we don't have to prepare for.

678
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,170
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

679
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,250
Let me check it out.

680
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,050
Coming.

681
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,330
Who is it?

682
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,990
Surprise.

683
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:24,810
Dr. Ling.

684
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,490
Why is she here?

685
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,570
Why is she here?

686
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,210
Yeah, why is she here?

687
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:40,890
Why?

688
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,170
Why is the insane woman

689
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,130
Tang Ping here?

690
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,130
How did she get here?

691
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,810
How did she know

692
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,570
we're here?

693
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:47,970
It might be…

694
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,530
Fate.

695
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,450
Why am I hearing her voice?

696
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,170
She… she is.

697
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,370
She is in the room next door.

698
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,850
Because of the poor sound insulation.

699
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
So she heard

700
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
everything that we said?

701
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,130
Lu Fangning,

702
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,370
the sound insulation is so bad.

703
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,610
I can hear clearly

704
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,250
whatever you do.

705
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,050
I'm changing my room.

706
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,210
Me too then.

707
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,970
I'll go to another hotel.

708
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,420
I've looked it up.

709
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,090
This is the only hotel in the town.

710
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,650
Fangning,

711
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,130
let's forget about it today.

712
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,130
No way, we can't.

713
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,570
Now that she's here today,

714
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,450
who knows what tricks

715
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,330
she will play tomorrow.

716
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,090
But,

717
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,130
there is no but.

718
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,100
Ling Rui, look at me.

719
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,490
♫ The vengeance of hell ♫

720
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,130
♫ boils in my heart. ♫

♫ surrounds me ♫

♫ If you do not ♫

♫ kill Sarastro to avenge me ♫

727
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,450
Fangning,

728
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,800
we don't have to force ourselves tonight.

729
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,850
♫ Disowned may you be forever ♫

730
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,570
♫ Abandoned may you be forever ♫

731
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,280
Morning.

732
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,730
Darling.

733
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,810
Eat more this morning, all right?

734
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,370
Where should we go shopping today?

735
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,730
I'm going too.

736
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,510
[Nanshanzhen Activity Center]

737
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,290
Tang Ping.

738
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,129
You'd better not

739
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,689
waste your time here.

740
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,010
Ling Rui will only

741
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,730
love me forever and ever.

742
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,770
What I care about is

743
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,359
my future

744
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:29,210
with Dr. Ling.

745
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,800
Now, I just need to assure

746
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
you two won't

747
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,050
do something bad.

748
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,089
Ms. Tang,

749
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:36,010
I remember that I

750
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,609
made it clear to you…

751
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,310
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,129
Keep your mouth shut now.

753
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:38,730
That's right.

754
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,800
I'll take care of this.

755
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:43,689
Tang Ping.

756
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,169
Do you still remember

757
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,010
Wei, Fanfan,

758
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,280
Han, Liangliang

759
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,290
and Dingding.

760
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,970
You've always been

761
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,879
defeated by me

762
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,210
for all these years.

763
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,770
How dare you mention them!

764
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,370
Lu Fangning, you bad girl!

765
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,570
Wait and see.

766
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,850
I'll make you suffer

767
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,770
tonight.

768
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,690
Pingping, let me explain.

769
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,290
Don't come closer.

770
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,770
You accepted my gift.

771
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,250
I'm just too fond of you.

772
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,650
And you said in your live streams

773
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,890
that you want people to follow you more

774
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,450
and like you more.

775
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,050
I don't mean it like that.

776
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,570
No.

777
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,330
Let's take a picture then.

778
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,650
Or I can take a picture of you.

779
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,890
Stop following me.

780
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,770
I'll call the police if you come closer.

781
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,610
Pingping.

782
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,130
Then see you next time.

783
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,610
What should I do?

784
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,370
Tell my dad?

785
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,890
No.

786
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,370
My dad is going to kill him.

787
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,290
This one.

788
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,810
This one is just a freeloader!

789
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,330
And this one?

790
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,650
This one only knows who to lick my shoes!

791
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,210
Shall I go to Lu Fangning for help?

792
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,290
What's wrong?

793
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,640
Why are you shouting here?

794
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,930
Because you will only scold me.

795
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,490
What are you saying?

796
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,200
What's wrong?

797
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,290
I…

798
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,090
That means,

799
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,370
you don't know his name,

800
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,450
contact way

801
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,920
and any useful information?

802
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,490
No.

803
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,170
How about his picture,

804
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,090
video, or voice recording?

805
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,770
No.

806
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,290
How about your brain? Do you have a brain?

807
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,690
No.

808
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,530
I really thought he was my fan.

809
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,520
Fan?

810
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,360
What kind of fan is he?

811
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,810
Shows up in front of you again and again

812
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,730
and waits at your door.

813
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,610
He's not a fan.

814
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,170
He's a freak.

815
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,770
A stalker, you know that?

816
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,090
What do you practice in

817
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,890
the judo gym normally?

818
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,570
You only know how to take pictures.

819
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,570
See?

820
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,890
You can't beat him now.

821
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,890
And you can't outrun him.

822
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,850
You don't even have a brain.

823
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,450
Stop it.

824
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,170
I'm already scared.

825
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,250
What should I do now?

826
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,130
I can only ask you for help

827
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,010
after thinking about it again and again.

828
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,930
Lu Fangning,

829
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,410
help me.

830
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,370
I'm done.

831
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,050
I'm screwed.

832
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,280
I'm doomed.

833
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,850
You'd better disappear.

834
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,050
You shut up.

835
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,290
Be quiet for a while.

836
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,690
I'll go if you don't shut up.

837
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,370
I'm leaving.

838
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,890
Didn't your dad teach you

839
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,890
when you were little?

840
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,090
If something bad happens,

841
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,970
go to the police.

842
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,680
The police?

843
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,330
Listen carefully.

844
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,730
Okay, I understand.

845
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,570
All right, I know.

846
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,930
Where did she go?

847
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,000
Fangning.

848
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,490
I'm done with my work.

849
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,880
Let's go eat.

850
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:42,850
Wait a second.

851
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,010
Maybe later. Later.

852
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,490
She refused to dine with me?

853
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,170
Is she really upset?

854
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,770
What are you looking for?

855
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,770
You need my help?

856
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:54,570
You…

857
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,010
I can't let Ling Rui

858
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,560
meddle in this kind of thing.

859
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,170
You can't do it.

860
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,690
Rest assured.

861
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,650
I can take care of it on my own.

862
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,290
I'll look for you later.

863
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,920
See you at night.

864
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,610
I can't do it?

865
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,450
She'll take care of it on her own?

866
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,810
It's about your honor as a man.

867
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,890
How come you don't have any strength as a man?

868
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,290
Was it because of last night?

869
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,610
Is she despising me?

870
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,490
I didn't see him.

871
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,690
Are we really doing this?

872
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,570
How else can we

873
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,370
lure the stalker out?

874
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,210
Come on.
