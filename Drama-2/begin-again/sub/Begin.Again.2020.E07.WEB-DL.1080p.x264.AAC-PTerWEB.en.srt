00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,080
as a

193
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
Living Room Exploration Hall,

194
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,440
simulating a sense of being at home,

195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,640
to make customers feel like they are home.

196
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,750
Sit down.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,720
Our employees

198
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
usually rest here, too.

199
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,480
The sofa over there

200
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,400
is an exhibition.

201
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
But, it has been booked

202
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,080
by our customer.

203
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
So we can't sit there.

204
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Just make do with it.

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,040
Sit here.

206
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,600
Never mind.

207
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
It's quite comfortable here.

208
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,720
Here you are.

209
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Thank you.

210
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,640
We only have chips here.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Next time I'll ask my staff

212
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,160
to order

213
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,320
something more delicious.

214
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,200
It's okay.

215
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
It's good enough.

216
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,270
However,

217
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,400
we probably won't get to do this again.

218
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,880
Nothing. Enjoy it.

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm so tired.

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
Shall we

221
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
find something interesting

222
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
to do?

223
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,600
Do...

224
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Do what?

225
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,520
Come here.

226
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Let's play this.

227
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
The winner can ask

228
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,560
the other person a question.

229
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
The other one has to answer truthfully

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,280
and can't hide anything,

231
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,800
so we can

232
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,160
learn more about each other.

233
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm not in.

234
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,950
I don't wanna know more about you.

235
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,000
Come on.

236
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
So childish. I don't want to play.

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll go first.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Your turn.

239
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,120
Pick one.

240
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,790
Have you decided?

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,080
Don't rush me.

242
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,600
Strategy matters.

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,510
Okay, take your time.

244
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Be quieter when you eat chips.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
I got distracted.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
You lost. I win.

247
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Ask me.

248
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,320
I am not

249
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,880
curious about you.

250
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
I don't know what to ask.

251
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
Okay, I got one.

252
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
What do you think of Tang Ping?

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Tang Ping?

254
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
Not interested.

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,800
Then in hospital, you and her...

256
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
Her father had

257
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,640
an unexplained shadow in his lungs.

258
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
She took the X-ray there,

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,520
which is

260
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
exactly my specialty.

261
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
So I took him in.

262
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,960
No more?

263
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
-Yep.
-That's all?

264
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,040
Go on.

265
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
I win again.

266
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Awesome people indeed

267
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,320
do well in everything.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Go ahead.

269
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
Why did you suddenly

270
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,560
decide to marry me?

271
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
Because I wanted to help you.

272
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,120
And?

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
Nothing.

274
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,960
Nothing again?

275
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,440
You...

276
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
You're not playing fair.

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
I'm not lying.

278
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm not dodging it.

279
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,920
Go on.

280
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
You lose.

281
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,640
It's my turn to ask you.

282
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,480
Why did you want to

283
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,400
marry me so badly?

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Was there any other reason

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
other than work?

286
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
Of course, I wanted to

287
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,840
have a baby with you.

288
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
But I can't let him know.

289
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,400
And I can neither lie nor evade it.

290
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
What should I say?

291
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,280
Because I want to

292
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,600
have a deeper...

293
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,080
A deeper connection with you.

294
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,480
Another round?

295
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
I...

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,120
I feel sleepy.

297
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Okay then.

298
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
Let's stop.

299
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Would you like to watch a film?

300
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
♫ The potent fragrance of the rose petals ♫

301
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,060
♫ I don't mind walking
on the streets alone ♫

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,560
♫ The movies are always full
of disappointment and farewells ♫

303
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,620
♫ But, who will watch them with me ♫

304
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,810
♫ Slowly, we get closer ♫

305
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,590
♫ I like you ♫

306
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,300
♫ Only you ♫

307
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,000
♫ You're my one and only ♫

308
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,300
♫ Tonight, I'll let my mind wander ♫

309
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,720
♫ Tonight is the night ♫

310
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,500
♫ I want to travel to Paris and Tokyo,
and eat chocolate by the sea ♫

311
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,990
♫ As long as I'm with you ♫

312
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:41,140
♫ We can lie on the beach
and count the stars ♫

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,960
♫ I like you because you put up with me ♫

314
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,170
♫ My unyielding stubbornness ♫

315
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,710
♫ It's all because of you ♫

316
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,160
♫ I like you ♫

317
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,950
♫ Only you ♫

318
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,650
♫ You're my one and only ♫

319
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:21,830
♫ Under the moon, on the bright street,
we'll hold our wedding tonight ♫

320
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,340
♫ Only you ♫

321
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,090
♫ You're my one and only ♫

322
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,350
♫ We need to learn no more,
we'll fall in love tonight ♫

323
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,120
Ms. Lu.

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,040
Ms. Lu.

325
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,640
Ms. Lu.

326
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,920
Darling.

327
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,770
Yes?

328
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Let's go to work.

329
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,710
Okay.

330
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,070
Let's go.

331
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,880
Did you sleep well last night?

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,920
Pretty good.

333
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,680
I had a nice dream.

334
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,040
And you?

335
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Me too.

336
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,120
I thought you were

337
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,440
already awake, right?

338
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,320
You pretended to be asleep.

339
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,080
It was so awkward.

340
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,230
[More brands and surprises upstairs!]

341
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,630
This is your place.

342
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,670
You're more suitable

343
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,510
to deal with the situation.

344
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,280
Wait for me here.

345
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,030
-Ma.
-Ms. Lu.

346
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,200
Before closing the door,

347
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,120
you must check

348
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,040
if there is anyone inside

349
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,720
to make sure

350
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
the safety of people and goods.

351
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,240
-Got it?
-Yes.

352
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,840
Done?

353
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
Do you have something to do later?

354
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,280
Why don't you drive me to the hospital?

355
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
I drive you to the hospital?

356
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,640
I mean...

357
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,030
How about we have our breakfast there?

358
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,600
What do you want?

359
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,360
Anything is okay, you decide.

360
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,480
You can taste

361
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,640
the grain porridge here

362
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,000
and some desserts.

363
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
Okay.

364
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,080
You go take a seat. I'll go get the food.

365
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,320
Let's go together.

366
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,560
Okay.

367
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Sis Li.

368
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,520
What else do you want?

369
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,720
Okay.

370
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,600
I can't.

371
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,560
Thank you.

372
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,160
-Do you know her?
-You go.

373
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,350
Go, you go ask.

374
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,030
Director Ling.

375
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:03,960
Yes.

376
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
-You're here for breakfast?
-Yeah, hello.

377
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,920
Thank you.

378
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
She is...

379
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,000
She's my wife.

380
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,950
You're married, Dr. Ling?

381
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,690
Yes.

382
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,600
Okay.

383
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,280
Let's go.

384
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,640
Thank you, Sis Li.

385
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,540
You're welcome.

386
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,760
I told you he's married.

387
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
That's his wife.

388
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,800
Where do you want to sit?

389
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
Thanks.

390
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,200
You're welcome.

391
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
Is that his sister?

392
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
She's quite pretty.

393
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,000
I heard that Dr. Ling
has been long married.

394
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Really?

395
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

396
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
You're married, Ling Rui?

397
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
She's your wife?

398
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,120
Yes.

399
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,400
Congratulations.

400
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,360
Thank you.

401
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,640
Tastes good.

402
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,280
Taste the dessert.

403
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
-Morning, Director Ling.
-Morning.

404
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,240
Good morning, Mrs. Ling.

405
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,510
Mrs. Ling is so beautiful.

406
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,840
Thank you.

407
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Here.

408
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,520
No one knows who I am.

409
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,680
I should

410
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,720
introduce you to them.

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,760
No, no. I was kidding.

412
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,560
You are better than me in the hospital.

413
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,200
No one will address you as

414
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,960
Lu Fangning's husband.

415
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,470
Now,

416
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm Dr. Ling's wife.

417
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,360
Mrs. Ling.

418
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,080
I like this.

419
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
I do matter more

420
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,160
than you at the hospital.

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,560
Fangning.

422
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,840
I don't quite like being noticed

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
by many people.

424
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
So,

425
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,760
I didn't tell my colleagues

426
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,240
about my marriage.

427
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I didn't know you would...

428
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,480
It's okay.

430
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,560
I didn't mind.

431
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,040
And,

432
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
theoretically, the surgeons

433
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,480
must not wear any accessories,

434
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,240
because we may be required
to do an operation

435
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
at any time.

436
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,120
But, I don't have any today.

437
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
I'll wear it

438
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,320
as often as possible from now on.

439
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm not pushing you

440
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,920
to wear it all the time.

441
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,720
Of course, you can

442
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
take it off in the hospital.

443
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
When you come back home,

444
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,240
just put it on.

445
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,800
Okay.

446
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,040
After breakfast,

447
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,640
I don't have anything else to do.

448
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,560
You can walk me around the hospital.

449
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Okay.

450
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,720
-Go ahead.
-Go ahead.

451
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,550
[General Surgery Ward Area]

452
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,640
Will I

453
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,040
disturb your work?

454
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,720
Just a while. It's okay.

455
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Um,

456
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,750
how about this?

457
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,080
It's fine.

458
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,720
This must be Mrs. Ling.

459
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,800
So you're going to

460
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
make your marriage known?

461
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
This is how a honeymoon
should look like.

462
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,960
I got tied up during my wedding.

463
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,070
I didn't have time to ask you.

464
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,280
How should I address you?

465
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,960
Curly.

466
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
Look, how curly his hair is.

467
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
Call him Curly.

468
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,790
Easy to remember.

469
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,160
You can call me Curly, sounds better.

470
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,510
We all call him that.

471
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,480
I'm Yang Jin, Mrs. Ling.

472
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
Just call me Yang.

473
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm Mengmeng.

474
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
Call me Xun, Mrs. Ling.

475
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,440
You're so cute. Wait a second.

476
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,120
What are you finding?

477
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,400
I think I should give them

478
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,880
some red packets.

479
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,360
You're so generous, Mrs. Ling.

480
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,000
So generous of you.

481
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
"Mrs. Ling", I can call that
a few more times.

482
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,840
You know what?

483
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,880
I can call that, too.

484
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,720
Sister-in-law, right?

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,280
Wait.

486
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,760
I didn't bring red packets today.

487
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll bring it to you next time.

488
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,720
-Alright.
-Thank you in advance.

489
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,920
We're not in a rush.

490
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,920
You don't have work to do?

491
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,200
Alright, we've greeted her.

492
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,400
We didn't get the red packets.

493
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
We saw how sweet they are. Let's go.

494
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,720
-Bye, Mrs. Ling.
-Bye.

495
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,040
Alright, go back to work.

496
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,150
Our mission today

497
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,200
has been accomplished.

498
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,760
What about you?

499
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,280
I have something

500
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,440
to deal with later.

501
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,520
Okay, I'll go to work.

502
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,240
Go.

503
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,030
[Always at your service]

504
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,440
So you should

505
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,400
do a regular check-up.

506
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,760
Dad, look...

507
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
Why are you here?

508
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,840
Pingping.

509
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm sick,

510
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
so Fangning came to visit me.

511
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,160
How considerate she is, you see?

512
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Uncle Tang, you don't have to worry.

513
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,680
Ling Rui

514
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
is the chief surgeon here.

515
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,720
You can tell him if you need anything.

516
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Um.

517
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,040
Fangning,

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,600
about Dr. Ling,

519
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,920
do you mind?

520
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,160
Of course, I don't.

521
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Ling Rui and I

522
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,560
are already married.

523
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,160
If you want something,

524
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,800
you can ask Tang Ping to contact Ling Rui.

525
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,110
But if you think Tang Ping

526
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,440
is unreliable and

527
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,760
immature,

528
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
I can help you.

529
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,240
Alright, thank you.

530
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,040
I'm leaving.

531
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,310
You can take a good rest.

532
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,240
Bye, Uncle Tang.

533
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,000
I came to visit Uncle Tang.

534
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,360
Mind your behavior.

535
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,120
As his daughter,

536
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,760
shouldn't you

537
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,840
express your gratitude?

538
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

539
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,240
Didn't you see that

540
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
my visit

541
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,560
put Uncle Tang at ease?

542
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,880
Tang Pingping,

543
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,760
can you please

544
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,840
grow up

545
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,960
and be more considerate?

546
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Your father is sick now.

547
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,600
Yet, you let him worry about you.

548
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,510
How could you be a...

549
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,840
Don't say that word!

550
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,600
The grudge is between

551
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,520
the two of us.

552
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't get others involved.

553
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,120
Okay?

554
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,840
Grudge?

555
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,960
I don't think there is bad blood
between us.

556
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
If there is, it's about winning or losing.

557
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,560
Will you win?

558
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,480
If anyone asks who you are,

559
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,160
you can just say

560
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,520
you're a friend of Mrs. Ling.

561
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,600
That'll be good.

562
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
I feel so pleased.

563
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,880
You!

564
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,760
Does the apple taste good, Mr. Lu?

565
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
Sister, good afternoon.

566
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,920
Okay.

567
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,750
Sister, how did it go?

568
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,120
Did anything happen?

569
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,880
-I'll peel it for you.
-It was okay.

570
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay?

571
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:09,760

Try it.

763
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,560
I'll go take a shower.

764
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,240
Thank you.

765
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,800
Smells good.

766
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,000
It's pretty good.

767
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,920
Darling.

768
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,960
What?

769
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,760
I'm so careless.

770
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,800
Um...

771
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,440
I forgot to bring the towel in.

772
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
Can you get it for me?

773
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,830
Darling.

774
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,720
Be quick.

775
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,630
Darling.

776
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,640
-I can't reach it.
-Then, I'm leaving.

777
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,600
Ling Rui, Ling Rui!

778
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,040
I'm coming out.

779
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,680
I'm coming out.

780
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,000
Why is my heart beating so fast?

781
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,200
What's wrong?

782
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,440
Why did you drink so much water?

783
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,720
I don't know why.

784
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,600
I just feel thirsty.

785
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,000
Are you wearing too many layers?

786
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Take off your clothes.

787
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,000
It's okay.

788
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,560
I might have caught a cold.

789
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,760
A cold?

790
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,000
I changed

791
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,080
my shampoo today.

792
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,640
Smell it.

793
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,790
See if you can smell it.

794
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,240
I've been in the shower for too long.

796
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,640
I feel dizzy.

797
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,720
No, no.

798
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,800
Ling Rui.

799
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,520
What?

800
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,640
What are you doing?

801
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,120
I don't know why

802
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,600
I feel so hot too.

803
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,950
You're sweating a lot.

804
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,150
Darling.

805
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Flu

806
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,720
is contagious.
