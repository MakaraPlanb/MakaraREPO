[Begin Again]

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,230
[Episode 04]

4
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,140
Well done.

5
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,850
Don't be lazy. Come practice.

6
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,860
Yu, if it weren't for you,

7
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,580
I think

8
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,860
I wouldn't have learned

9
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,660
all of these.

10
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,260
Besides, at the most critical moment,

11
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,220
you lend me four million.

12
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,380
I'll make sure I learn it well.

13
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,220
If it weren't for you,

14
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,700
who uses

15
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,900
your multiple fail attempts

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,910
to motivate me,

17
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,260
a black swan with broken wings like me

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,270
would've given up

19
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,900
my dream way too soon.

20
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,380
It's just four million. It's worth it.

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,700
Our families

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,740
will meet soon.

23
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,940
-What if...
-Wait a minute.

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,180
We're meeting?

25
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,100
If my dad finds out

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,860
that we know each other here

27
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,260
he'll definitely break my legs.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,540
For now, we shouldn't

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,380
scare ourselves.

30
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,580
When we meet,

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,420
we don't know each other.

32
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:57,340
I am that

33
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,020
pretty divorcee.

34
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,940
Then...

35
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,540
Then, I don't know you either.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,900
I am

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,690
the black swan with a pair of broken wings.

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,500
This is good.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,860
Continue. Your leg.

40
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,220
The tip of your foot.

41
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,860
Your knee.

42
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,650
Move your shoulder blade down.

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,130
Today,

44
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,570
we invite the Ling family

45
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,220
over.

46
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,930
I know that

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,340
this is not really appropriate

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,490
according to the Chinese custom.

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,900
Marriage is

50
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,500
not child's play.

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,380
But, this young couple

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,740
is busy with their career.

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,490
I think we shouldn't delay a happy event.

54
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,420
Therefore,

55
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,180
there's anything I missed out,

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,420
I hope Mrs. Ling can forgive me.

57
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,320
Although

58
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,740
this seems a little hasty,

59
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,220
but I think

60
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,500
if they

61
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,660
are happy

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,219
together,

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,900
we, as the parents,

64
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,400
should have nothing to worry about.

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,580
Mrs. Ling, I'm relieved

66
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,760
to hear what you said.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,980
Before this,

68
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,330
Fangning

69
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,370
has briefly

70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,420
told me about Ling's background.

71
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,260
Today,

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,010
given this opportunity
for us to gather around,

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,930
I hope that

74
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,859
Ling can personally

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,540
and formally

76
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,609
introduce yourself

77
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,980
to Aunt Yang and me.

78
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,780
-Uncle Lu, I...
-Dad.

79
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,380
I don't think this is necessary.

80
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,740
Before this,

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,900
I've briefed you a couple of times.

82
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,490
His age, occupation, origin,

83
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,530
and his family.

84
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,410
They are all here.

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,850
What else do you want to know?

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,000
Uncle Lu.

87
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,050
I did medicine

88
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,130
for my undergraduate.

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,570
Now, I'm working at the city hospital.

90
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm a general surgeon.

91
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,860
Maybe you don't know much about me,

92
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,810
and

93
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,180
it's inevitable for you to worry.

94
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,090
But,

95
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,340
I promise you and aunt.

96
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,940
You don't have to worry.

97
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,260
I'll do my best

98
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,580
to secure our marriage,

99
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
and treat her well.

100
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,180
Great, great.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,730
Good.

102
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,290
Ling Rui

103
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,420
is currently the deputy chief.

104
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,900
Throughout all these years,

105
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,690
he's been actively working,

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,170
trying to pursue his studies in Germany.

107
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,100
After

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,080
he comes back from Germany,

109
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,900
I think

110
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,540
he'll be an incredible man.

111
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,060
Well.

112
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,640
If any of you

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,770
feels uncomfortable in the future,

114
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,540
you can go to the hospital to find Ling Rui.

115
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,020
Yes, Aunt Yang.

116
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,320
Don't you have a bad hearing?

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,980
I can ask Ling Rui to help you.

118
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,500
It should be quite convenient for us

119
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,940
if Ling Rui and I have children in the future.

120
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,340
Deputy chief.

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,530
How much is your monthly salary?

122
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,540
Adding up my monthly pay and bonus

123
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,620
every month I can get

124
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
about fifteen thousand.

125
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,730
That's too little.

126
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,230
Our Aunt Gao

127
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,620
is paid approximately the same.

128
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,500
That's different.

129
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,340
Their talent is different.

130
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,790
That's right.

131
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,570
Ling Rui is also a volunteer.

132
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,490
He's very caring.

133
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,860
He contributes a lot to society too.

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,870
This...

135
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Mom.

136
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,530
Aunt Gao made this.

137
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,500
Your favorite dish.

138
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,050
Eat more. The dishes are turning cold.

139
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,540
Right.

140
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,660
Fangyu is right.

141
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,010
You focus on chatting.

142
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,290
The dishes have turned cold.

143
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,080
Come.

144
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,370
I propose a toast

145
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,940
to welcome the Ling family

146
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,570
as our guest.

147
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,609
-Welcome.
-Cheers.

148
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,380
Welcome.

149
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,220
Cheers.

150
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,220
It was a hasty invitation.

151
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,220
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

152
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,500
Next time,

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,609
maybe we can meet at a good restaurant.

154
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,690
-Yes.
-Then,

155
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,660
we can sit down

156
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,580
to discuss

157
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,460
our children's wedding date.

158
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,540
Sure.

159
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,250
You're too nice.

160
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,690
We have a big family.

161
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,410
That's not an issue.

162
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,940
There are many rooms at our place.

163
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,220
-You can stay whenever you want.
-Lu Fangning.

164
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,650
Why you?

165
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,740
Should it be you, then?

166
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:14,980
Dr. Ling,

167
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,010
why are you marrying Lu Fangning

168
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,940
all of a sudden?

169
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,650
Are you indebted to her?

170
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,930
You must be indebted to her.

171
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,200
Lu Fangning,

172
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,340
you're too mean.

173
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,260
Because of money,

174
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,130
you forced Dr. Ling...

175
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,060
You saw it.

176
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,130
We are in love with each other.

177
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,540
Lu Fangning.

178
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,170
What are you doing?

179
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:43,859
Touching up my makeup.

180
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,450
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

181
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,290
I will

182
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,170
clean it up for you.

183
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,540
Dr. Ling.

184
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,450
Professor Ling.

185
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,180
Not bad.

186
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,010
No wonder you're a smart student.

187
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,490
It felt great.

188
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,340
You did well too.

189
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,010
It's as if we have gone from elementary school

190
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,370
straight to the university.

191
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,220
Why don't we

192
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,340
pursue our studies?

193
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,370
What... what do you mean?

194
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,290
I mean

195
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,890
I'm very pleased

196
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,370
with our progress.

197
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Drive safe.

198
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,210
Firstly,

199
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,090
based on the principle of equality
and mutual benefit,

200
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,460
both parties have agreed

201
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,650
to marry on our own will.

202
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,210
Of course, during our marriage,

203
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,660
we cannot interfere with each other's freedom.

204
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,290
If there's any conflict that can't be solved,

205
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,020
we can divorce.

206
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,930
Secondly, if necessary,

207
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,700
you must fulfill

208
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,810
all obligations of a husband.

209
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,890
Because

210
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,620
I have a unique identity.

211
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,010
Sometimes,

212
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,180
you have to

213
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,090
be Lu Fangning's husband.

214
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,890
Just like today.

215
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,660
When

216
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,570
we almost got caught,

217
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,450
you'll have to

218
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,380
do some intimate acts.

219
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,980
Of course.

220
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,620
If you think

221
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,260
this is not fair to you,

222
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,410
we can add another clause.

223
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,820
I will also act as your wife

224
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,770
and accommodate to you

225
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,770
whenever it's necessary.

226
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,780
The third clause

227
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,020
is set

228
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
based on my personal kindness.

229
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,810
I'll protect

230
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,610
your privacy.

231
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,260
I'll not publish

232
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,170
your personal information

233
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,410
and your photos

234
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,340
on any social media.

235
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,290
Of course, if one day,

236
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,330
we have to announce

237
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,410
our relationship,

238
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,650
I will also

239
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,690
censor your photos

240
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,530
before I publish it.

241
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,940
The following clause

242
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,020
is not that important.

243
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,330
You only have to listen to it.

244
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,460
This is mainly about

245
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,250
the distribution of assets
after we get married.

246
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,500
If one day,

247
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,610
we both achieve our goals

248
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,420
in this marriage,

249
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,370
Party B needs to give up unconditionally.

250
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,340
That means

251
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,290
what is yours remains yours.

252
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,130
What's mine remains mine.

253
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,740
Some things may appear to be shared,

254
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,930
but are actually mine.

255
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,500
What do you mean by appearing to be shared?

256
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,220
Legal documents

257
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,490
contain

258
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,140
a lot of confusing expressions.

259
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,220
It's not important.

260
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,410
The rest are

261
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,410
just some formalities.

262
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,660
Sign it.

263
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,890
The contract is so ambiguous.

264
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,900
It's meaningless.

265
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,860
Cross it out.

266
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,680
And

267
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,930
I'll add one more clause.

268
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,810
All the rights and duties

269
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,420

271
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,980
without violating the law.

295
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,500
Am I disturbing you?

296
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,500
Of course, not.

297
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,650
You are worried

298
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,330
about Fangning and me, right?

299

Fangning

300
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,780
is actually

301
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,730
not born talented.

302
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,380
What she has today

303
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,530
is a result

304
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,860
of her foolhardy handwork.

305
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,490

306

quite pretty.

307
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,340
But, there's something about her
that doesn't feel like a woman.

308
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,180
There are no rules

309
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,940
about how a woman should be like

310
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,290
and how a man should be like.

311
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,300
So, how is Fangning like?

312
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,570
She is whom I admire.

313
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,250
Sometimes,

314
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,540
she might be a little

315
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,580
willful,

316
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,380
capricious,

317

can understand her well,

322
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,940
then

Is that why you have to marry her?

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,700
In the meantime,

389
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,340
I have closed deals

390
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,290
to purchase materials

391
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,970
needed for the production of Infinity

392
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,210
at the best price.

393
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,440
Now,

394
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,130
we'll start the board of directors meeting
of LM Deer Sing group

395
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,660
to vote for

396
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,090
the establishment of Infinity.

397
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,260
The voting will start now.

398
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,819
Nice to see everyone.

399
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,059
Everyone is here.

400
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,100
Chairman Lu.

401
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,340
It's been a long time.

402
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,080
-Chairman Lu.
-Chairman Lu.

403
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,090
Hey.

404
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,299
Why did you stand up?

405
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,500
Sit down.

406
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,100
Sit down.

407
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,260
I...

408
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,500
Yesterday,

409
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,090
Fangning told me that

410
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:31,130
there would be

411
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,809
a major event at the company today.

412
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,289
Being my nosy self,

413
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,660
I am here to have a look.

414
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,700
I hope I am not disturbing you.

415
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,690
I'll just watch from the side.

416
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,780
Fangning,

417
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,730
have you told everyone

418
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,250
about your opinions?

419
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,260
-Yes, I have.
-Yes.

420
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,810
How's it?

421
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,460
Has the voting started?

422
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,940
It's just started.

423
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,170
Who's done voting?

424
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,900
Tang,

425
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,730
did you vote for it?

426
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,930
-Liu, how about you?
-Chairman,

427
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,940
look at everyone.

428
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,820
Everyone?

429
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,290
-Zheng?
-I'll cast my vote now.

430
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,620
Now?

431
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,890
Ma,

432
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,570
what do you think?

433
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,620
I...

434
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,260
Why do you think...

435
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,180
This voting session...

436
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,980
...Lu Wenbin's here?

437
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,820
What does this have to do with him?

438
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,300
...is

439
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,250
a very serious matter.

440
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,930
This will affect

441
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,410
the company's development.

442
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,020
Therefore,

443
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,100
the only advice I can give

444
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,380
is to vote

445
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,260
however you should.

446
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,130
Okay.

447
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,740
Go on.

448
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,770
The voting continues.

449
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,820
Mr. Yang, look.

450
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,220
Even if Lu Wenbin is here,

451
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
so what?

452
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,020
It won't help.

453
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Fangning,

454
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,500
it's not that we don't support you.

455
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,940
Look at this.

456
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,500
We're being democratic.

457
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,730
Chairman Lu is here too.

458
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,540
Perhaps,

459
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,340
we should slow it down?

460
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,450
Mr. Yang is right.

461
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,340
We should slow it down.

462
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,060
Slow it down.

463
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,540
Yes. Take it slow.

464
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,440
-Take it slow. -Yes.

465
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,980
That's good.

466
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,930
Wait a minute.

467
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,980
Sorry.

468
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,980
I'm late.

469
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,340
How can you be late for a meeting?

470
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
I will vote

471
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,100
for

472
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,340
the establishment of Infinity.

473
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,900
Ms. Xiao.

474
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,810
You're new.

475
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,970
There are many things in this company
that you don't know well.

476
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,140
I know the company

477
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,340
well enough.

478
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,620
Besides, I look forward

479
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,620
to see

480
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,730
the household brand

481
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,210
created by someone like Ms. Lu.

482
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,220
I surely won't disappoint Ms. Xiao.

483
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,400
What's going on?

484
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,500
Chairman Lu, look.

485
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,260
Ms. Xiao wasn't around just now.

486
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,970
We'll vote again.

487
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,810
Voting starts now.

488
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,860
Alright.

489
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,420
I hereby declare that

490
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,220
we will now

491
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,780
officially establish Infinity.

492
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,160
[LM Deer Sing Group]

493
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,740
Thank you.

494
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,060
I still don't understand

495
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,050
why Ms. Xiao

496
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,780
changed your mind all of a sudden?

497
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,090
Next time,

498
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,570
don't run anymore.

499
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,410
Xin Bao,

500
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,980
why are you crying?

501
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,380
He was running around before he fell down.

502
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,420
Did you fall down?

503
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,330
Did you hurt your knees?

504
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,210
It doesn't hurt anymore.

505
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,890
That's good.

506
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,940
Xin Bao,

507
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,050
you can't run

508
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,090
in a hospital.

509
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,930
Understand?

510
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,450
There are many uncles and aunts

511
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,290
who are resting in the wards.

512
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,810
It's not good

513
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,850
if you disturb them.

514
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,810
You're a man now.

515
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,020
Men don't cry

516
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,290
that easily.

517
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,060
Understand?

518
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,700
If you want to play,

519
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,620
when you recover,

520
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,130
I'll bring you out to play.

521
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,050
-Really?
-Yes.

522
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,010
Dr. Ling.

523
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,540
Are you

524
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,260
Ms. Lu's colleague?

525
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,050
I didn't expect someone like her

526
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,900
to be Dr. Ling's friend.

527
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,450
Someone like her?

528
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,740
All work, no life.

529
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,530
But, all she wants is

530
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,900
to produce household items for others.

531
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,380
You're different.

532
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,260
You're a warm and cheerful guy.

533
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,660
The two of you

534
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,220
seem completely different.

535
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,100
Maybe we are different.

536
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,460
But,

537
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,060
doesn't everyone

538
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,380
has the right

539
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,660
to choose the lifestyle they want?

540
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,540
I respect her, and I understand her.

541
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,380
Also,

542
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,370
we are getting married soon.

543
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,970
Getting married?

544
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,610
Congratulations.

545
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,260
I think

546
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,570
I should prepare

547
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,650
a wedding gift for you.

548
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,860
I didn't expect him

549
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,980
to be your fiance.

550
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,540
But, he was right.

551
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,620
I should not have

552
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,210
judged a book by its cover.

553
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,060
I wish you

554
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,210
a happy marriage.

555
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,530
Thank you.

556
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,810
I don't care if your marriage

557
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,140
is real or fake.

558
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,940
But, from now on,

559
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,940
Lu Fangning

560
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,370
is no longer alone.

561
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,850
I guess.

562
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Anyway,

563
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,660
thanks for your vote.

564
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,330
Congratulations, Ms. Lu.

565
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:05,970
It has finally

566
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,380
passed the board meeting.

567
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,690
Bring Gavin to China immediately

568
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,740
to finalize the designs.

569
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,260
Besides,

570
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,420
implement the contract

571
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,180
we signed with the suppliers

572
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,300
and set up a production line immediately.

573
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,780
The materials are special.

574
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,090
There aren't many factories in China

575
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,980
that can produce this.

576
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,860
-Gao Erfan, you...
-Ms. Lu.

577
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,980
I'm afraid that

578
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,500
you have something else

579
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,810
more urgent than any of this

580
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,140
to deal with.

581
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,660
The wedding

582
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,780
on the upcoming weekend.

583
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,580
A wedding?

584
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,650
Who's tricking me into spending money again?

585
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,160
Yours.

586
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,880
Mine?

587
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,300
Yours.

588
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,810
Mine?

589
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,730
-Yours.
-What?

590
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,420
Right after the meeting just now,

591
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,140
all of the directors

592
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,130
received invitation cards

593
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,660
of you and Mr. Ling's wedding

594
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,740
from Chairman Lu.

595
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,730
The invitation cards are ready.

596
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,100
It's on this coming weekend.

597
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,540
Who wants a wedding?

598
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,420
I'm going to talk to him.

599
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,570
Wait a minute, Ms. Lu.

600
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,900
Think about it.

601
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,090
At this point in time,

602
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,220
it's better

603
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,940
if we do what Chairman Lu wants.

604
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,300
After all, your success didn't come easily.

605
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,900
Moreover,

606
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,820
getting married is a happy event.

607
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,530
Of course, we should celebrate it.

608
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,100
Share your joy

609
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,210
with others.

610
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,020
Celebrate it?

611
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,940
Share my joy?

612
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,050
You're right.

613
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,730
This is a matter that requires

614
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,220
so much time and energy.

615
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,180
Since I'm doing it,

616
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,450
I need to gain something from it.

617
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,060
Coincidentally,

618
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,140
we have just established Infinity,

619
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,740
and have solved the internal conflicts.

620
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,820
It's time

621
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,860
to invite our peers

622
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,100
to show their support.

623
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,540
The wedding is on.

624
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,060
We'll invite all our business partners

625
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,010
to my wedding.

626
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,010
This is wedding

627
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,330
will become

628
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,620
Infinity's marketing conference.

629
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,220
This...

630
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,570
Of course, it's up to Ms. Lu.

631
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,140
For the invitation card,

632
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,540
we'll use our marketing brochure.

633
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,660
During the wedding,
each guest will receive one.

634
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,100
After we decide on the wedding's itinerary,

635
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,620
nothing else matters.

636
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,730
But,

637
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,810
make sure to slot in

638
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,620
an introduction to our marketing slogan.

639
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,930
Infinity,

640
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,260
finite time,

641
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,100
infinite love.

642
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,100
Put it on the first page
of the invitation card.

643
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,570
Ms. Lu is so smart.

[We're happy to have you at our wedding]

649
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,460
This is the legendary wedding
of the rich and famous.

650
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,340
My rental, my meal allowance,

651
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,930
my boyfriend,

652
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,700
and the headlines

653
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,570
of the month

654
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,540
will all depend on this event.

655
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,530
I want to get a south-facing room.

656
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,410
It will cost me 300 yuan more every month.

657
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,940
I'm not picky with my food.

658
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,730
Take-outs will do.

659
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,900
Uni Gunkan,

660
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,540
Durian Pizza, Ikura Don.

661
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,500
Also, I hope that

662
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,060
I can meet

663
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,980
a mature, mysterious,
and domineering boyfriend.

664
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,180
Am I asking for too much?

665
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,890
Bless me! Just let me meet

666
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,850
this month's target.

667
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,500
Please give me a piece of big news,

668
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,250
Lu Fangning.

669
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,330
The daughter and the general manager

670
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,540
of LM Deer Sing Group, Lu Fangning,

671
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,780
is holding a grand wedding

672
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,180
at the Pavillion Hotel.

673
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,900
This is the greatest wedding

674
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,700
of the year.

675
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,890
Lu Fangning, the bride,

676
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,620
is wearing

677
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,810
a simple pair of custom-made bridal trousers.

678
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,090
Paired with the wedding veil,

679
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,370
the outfit is simple yet lavish.

680
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,780
The groom is wearing a bow tie

681
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,090
on top of his black suit

682
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,060
which is decorated with an L logo.

683
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,740
The two walked side by side
as they entered the banquet hall.

684
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,850
Apart from

685
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,890
all the exaggerated compliments

686
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,770
for me,

687
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,250
this bulletin

688
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,180
mentions nothing

689
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,130
about the specialties

690
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,170
of Infinity,

691
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,100
leave alone

692
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,780
Infinity's launch date.

693
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,260
Did I make a mistake when I assigned the jobs,

694
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,810
or you're just incapable?

695
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,690
Ms. Lu,

696
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,370
it's your wedding after all.

697
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,210
Shouldn't we focus on...

698
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,220
We should focus on

699
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,490
the first introduction to Infinity.

700
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,570
Do it again.

701
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,210
The wedding is about to begin.

702
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:44,940
After you're done,

703
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
I can read it right away.

704
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,540
We'll send it out immediately
after the wedding.

705
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Any problem?

706
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,570
No.

707
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Ling Rui?

708
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,850
I've never heard of him before.

709
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,620
After he marries Lu Fangning,

710
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,450
he'll live a comfortable life in the future.

711
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,740
There must be something he's good at

712
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,860
to be able to marry Lu Fangning.

713
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,250
I wonder

714
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,540
what he's so good at

715
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,370
to be able to conquer our proud missy.

716
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,500
Yes.

717
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
He's my son-in-law.

718
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,410
Of course, he is a great man.

719
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,650
Think about it.

720
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,500
Only a man as great as a deity

721
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,060
can take a fancy on my daughter.

722
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,690
Indeed, only a smart person like me

723
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,260
knows how to pick

724
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,970
the best bridal dress for myself.

725
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,300
This is so comfortable.

726
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,810
Wen, go take a rest.

727
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,620
You've done well.

728
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,620
Let's go.

729
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,170
Okay.

730
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,530
-My daughter-in-law.
-Mom.

731
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,810
-Fangning.
-Aunt.

732
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,980
-Aunt.
-The bride is so beautiful.

733
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,850
Come have a seat.

734
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,210
You're so pretty.

735
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,860
My dearest daughter-in-law,

736
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,220
mom knows you don't need money.

737
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,260
But, I prepared

738
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,300
a red packet for you.

739
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,380
I wish you

740
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,500
a lifetime of happiness.

741
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,020
Mom.

742
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,460
This is

743
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,050
my favorite phrase.

744
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,060
We will make

745
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,930
a perfect family.

746
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,850
Fangning, here.

747
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,770
This is my gift for you.

748
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,820
This looks...

749
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
-This is too big.
-Keep it.

750
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,490
Thanks, aunt.

751
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,570
Open it.

752
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,860
Do you like it?

753
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
This is

754
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,340
my most sincere blessing

755
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,060
to both of you.

756
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,260
I have received it.

757
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,060
I truly have.

758
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Tell me,

759
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,690
how do you feel?

760
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,170
She's getting married.

761
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,650
This is not a thesis presentation.

762
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,500
Fangning,

763
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,460
I've sent my gift

764
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,500
via phone.

765
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,330
Wishing you a happy marriage.

766
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,900
Check it out when you're home.

767
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,780
So secretive.

768
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,570
You don't have to know.

769
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,050
Ling Rui will know what to do

770
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,290
when the night falls.

771
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,800
Let's go.

772
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,140
Don't disturb the bride.

773
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,300
Mom, aunts,

774
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,780
then I won't go with you.

775
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,290
If you need anything, just talk to Gao Erfan.

776
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,180
I've told him to take care of you.

777
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,970
-Go on.
-Sure.

778
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,900
Okay.

779
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,050
Enjoy the food.

780
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,500
-Take a look at it.
-Let's go.

781
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,540
-Let's go.
-Our daughter-in-law.

782
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,620
We're leaving.

783
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,970
You're so pretty.

784
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,540
-I'm so happy today.
-Yes.

785
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,100
[Guidelines of a Happy Marriage]

786
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,650
I'll go find Ms. Lu.

787
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,370
What are you doing?

788
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:51,970
Let me through.

789
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,770
You can't go in there.

790
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,890
Go away.

791
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,980
You can't go in.

792
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,300
Get out of my way.

793
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,660
Lu Fangning.

794
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,210
Tang Pingping.

795
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,930
How dare you.

796
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,260
So?

797
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,050
I won't let you

798
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,060
marry him.

799
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,770
You'll never drag Ling Rui down.

800
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,850
I'm warning you.

801
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,620
Don't act like a madman here.

802
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,970
Your dad is inside.

803
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,820
So what?

804
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,010
Gao Erfan.

805
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,860
Ms. Tang, please follow me.

806
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,890
Sorry.

807
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,060
-Who are you? Get off me.
-I won't.

808
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,450
-Go away.
-I don't want to.

809
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,260
Who are you to Lu Fangning?

810
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,360
Why are you being so nosy?

811
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,810
I don't know her.

812
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,720
But, it's not good to ruin
someone else's wedding.

813
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm just doing it for justice.

814
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,650
Are you insane?

815
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,620
Let go.

816
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,140
What are you doing?

817
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,140
My dress.

818
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,650
Tang Pingping.

819
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,780
Tang Pingping.

820
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,540
The quality of your skirt

821
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,580
is not that good.

822
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,460
You...

823
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,490
This is much better.

824
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,500
This is how

825
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,540
a bridesmaid should look like.

826
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,220
Lu Fangning.

827
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,060
I'm here.

828
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,180
Stop yelling.

829
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
How about this?

830
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,090
Later,

831
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,370
you'll be my bridesmaid

832
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,940
and give your blessings to Ling Rui and me

833
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,580
on the stage.

834
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,330
What do you think?

835
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,060
That's impossible.

836
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,980
I want to tell everyone

837
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,220
that you forced Ling Rui to marry you.

838
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,730
Shut up.

839
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,460
Tang Pingping.

840
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,460
What are you doing here?

841
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,380
I...

842
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,760
Fangning,

843
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,010
I'm so sorry.

844
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,180
This madwoman of our family is here

845
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,300
to cause trouble again.

846
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,180
It's okay, Uncle Tang.

847
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,340
Next time,

848
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,860
if she can't control her own emotions,

849
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
I suggest you

850
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,840
not to let her out so easily.

851
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,730
What do you think?

852
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,460
You...

853
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,060
Don't worry.

854
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,250
I'll look after her.

855
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,770
You're too embarrassing.

856
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,380
Let's go.

857
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,460
Sorry.

858
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,100
Dad.

859
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,980
You've made a scene.

860
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,260
I'm too ashamed

861
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,300
to stay for the banquet.

862
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,420
Let's go.

863
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,860
-Don't you want to be my bridesmaid?
-Let's go.

864
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,540
Sorry.

865
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,050
You just wait.

866
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,620
-Bye. -Take care. -Let's go.

867
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,700
-What's going on?
-Dad.

868
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,930
Come here.

869
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,940
-Go home.
-Dad.

870
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,540
Who are you?

871
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,919
Cai Siyu.

872
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,140
Why are you here?

873
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,970
I'm just passing by.

874
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:21,859
You're a reporter, right?

875
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,250
-Ms. Lu, no.
-Gao Erfan.

876
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,500
Give her a media pass.

877
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,330
We didn't invite

878
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,050
any media.

879
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:28,859
There's no media pass.

880
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,250
Make one now.

881
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,770
Ms. Cai

882
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,580
will be the only reporter

883
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,330
invited to our wedding.

884
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,010
Yes.

885
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,930
Thanks...

886
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,379
But, all of your scripts

887
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,089
will have to go through

888
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:41,320
Mr. Gao.

889
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,129
Is there a problem?

890
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:43,240
No problem.

891
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:44,330
Thanks.

892
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,760
Goodbye.

893
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,530
Your boss is so cool.

894
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,900
Ling Rui,

895
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,460
you'll be mine after tonight.

896
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,090
Chairman Lu,

897
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,500
are your legs strong?

898
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,020
What do you mean?

899
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,370
I'm afraid that

900
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,810
you'll step on my hem later,

901
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,340
and trip both of us.

902
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,380
Don't worry.

903
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,410
I won't let you fall.

904
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,190
♫ I'll love you forever ♫

905
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,890

912
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,910
Good.

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,340

I can hear you. Speak.

927
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,050
My face?

928
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,050
Why do you need to edit it?

929
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,660
Do you think I'm Tang Ping?

930
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,130
I don't care about how I look.

931
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,290
I care only about Infinity.

932
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,770
Infinity is the most important thing.

933
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,740
Ling Rui,

934
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,620
hold this for me.

935
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,100
Give me a moment.

936
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,780
No worries.

937
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,130
All of the bulletins

938
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,860
must have

939
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,900
Infinity's logo.

940
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,380
Put Infinity's logo everywhere.

941
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,660
If you're adding watermarks,

942
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,410
use its logo too.

943
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,180
Understand?

944
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,220
Yes.

945
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,300
Gao Erfan, listen to me.

946
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,580
Find someone

947
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,420
to publish all the news

948
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,300
on social media.

949
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,900
Do you hear me?

950
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,290
I want it to be the headlines.

951
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,940
Infinity is the most important thing.

952
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,140
Understand?

953
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,300
It hurts.

954
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,620
What happened?

955
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,770
During the toast,

956
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,660
I twisted my ankle.

957
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,820
Also,

958
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,180
don't reveal anything

959
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,340
about the groom.

960
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,780
Censor his face.

961
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,780
You twisted your ankle?

962
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,370
Let me help you over.

963
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,260
Open it.

964
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,730
The first guideline of a happy marriage,

965
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,380
familiarity and proximity.

966
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:48,890
What happened?

967
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,250
I can't move.

968
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,220
Can you

969
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,210
bring me there?

970
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,820
Which foot?

971
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,700
This one.

972
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,010
Anything will do.

973
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,460
Do you need to

974
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,730
ask such a trivial question?

975
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,970
I can't see the swelling.

976
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,940
Here... right here.

977
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,130
I'll go get the ice pack.

978
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Sure.

979
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,930
Do as you say.

980
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,250
Here?

981
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,130
I wore the high heels for one whole day.

982
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,370
I'm so tired.
