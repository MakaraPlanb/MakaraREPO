[Episode 24]

4
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,070
Hello, Ling Rui.

5
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,690
What's the matter?

6
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,950
Why did you run away just now?

7
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,660
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,190
I can't make it

9
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,660
You're awake?

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,990
-Morning.
-Morning.

11
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,540
Why are you looking at me like this?

12
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,230
I'm really all right.

13
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,540
Who am I?

14
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm Lu Fangning.

15
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,430
Don't worry.

16
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,660
I can definitely save LM Deer Sing Group.

17
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,910
It's also okay

18
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,220
to be a "salted fish" (loser) occasionally

19
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,230
instead of Lu Fangning.

20
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,820
Salted fish is smelly.

21
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,510
I don't want to.

22
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,140
I don't want to be stinky Fangning.

23
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,820
I made salted fish porridge today.

24
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,150
Do you want some?

25
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,940
Of course.

26
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,260
You're finally back.

27
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,030
Go Erfan issued the notice

28
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,180
to suspend

29
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,980
all the operations of Infinity.

30
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,660
I received his email.

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,910
What exactly does he want to do?

32
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,820
He feels that I don't deserve

33
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,230
to fulfill the dream of my sister.

34
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,420
He wants to ruin LM Deer Sing Group

35
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,380
and us.

36
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm really speechless.

37
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,350
So what do you want to do next?

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,740
I'll never let him

39
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,940
have his way easily.

40
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,190
As said on the phone,

41
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,220
when will you give me

42
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,150
Infinity's public relations plan

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,630
for all the dealers

44
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,740
and media?

45
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,420
Ms. Lu,

46
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,380
we still have

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,460
other things which must be done first.

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,140
I want a specific time.

49
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,190
Ms. Lu, a notice has been issued

50
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,230
that Infinity's

51
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,620
plan has been suspended.

52
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,500
Even if the project has been terminated,

53
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,550
we still need to give everyone an explanation.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,150
Give it to me within today.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,890
Ms. Lu,

56
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,850
you're no longer in charge of LM Deer Sing Group.

57
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,890
It's not like before that

58
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,480
everything is your call.

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,160
We're just employees.

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,000
Please don't make this too hard for us.

61
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,570
But I'm talking about work now.

62
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,880
What is it?

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll do it.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,599
I love working

65
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,170
so much lately.

66
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,050
Ms. Lu,

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,320
leave it to me.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,430
Let's go.

69
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:30,810
Don't worry.

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,840
Ms. Lu.

71
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,800
Come.

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,680
Have something.

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,770
Thank you.

74
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
You're welcome.

75
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,090
I know that

76
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,010
you could make

77
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,890
those snobby employees follow your instructions

78
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,640
even if I wasn't there.

79
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,890
But

80
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,530
you can think of me as someone

81
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,770
who wants to play a protagonist.

82
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,010
Let me who is sweet and naive

83
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,200
to save the domineering boss once.

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,840
You can treat it as an employee benefit?

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Ms. Lu,

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,290
do you know

87
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,440
how the plot of a person like you

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,610
unfolds in fiction?

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,890
The first type is that

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,530
you've turned everything around,

91
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,400
solved your crisis in life smoothly,

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,570
and reached the peak of your life successfully.

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,210
The second type is that

94
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,840
you've really gone bankrupt

95
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,760
and are at rock bottom,

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,010
but then you managed to turn things around

97
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,520
and have reached the peak of your life again.

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,090
The former one is more direct.

99
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,080
The latter

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,320
has a bit more plot twists.

101
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,320
But in the end,

102
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
you'd have reached the peak of your life.

103
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,680

Yes?

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,210
If I were a male boss,

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,450
I'd certainly marry you.

111

112

do you know what you're doing?

What should I do, Ling Rui?

126
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:51,999
It seems like I really

127

Lu Wenbin.

195
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,090
What do you want to do?

196
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Why don't you understand?

197
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
Everything I've done

198
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,530
is for your sake.

199
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,640
For my sake?

200
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,090
I haven't had a good life

201
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,130
ever since I married you.

202
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,760
I tiptoe around you every day.

203
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,050
You yell at me all the time.

204
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,530
It's good that

205
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,520
you have no money now,

206
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,530
I can finally

207
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,080
do whatever I want without caring about your feelings.

208
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
You want me to give up

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,730
this great opportunity and divorce you instead?

210
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,130
Let me tell you.

211
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,690
There's no way.

212
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,370
What exactly do you want?

213
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,370
-You.
-Shut up.

214
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,010
I want to be the lady of the house.

215
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,410
From now on, you have to listen to me.

216
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Don't look down on me

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,290
because I'm a housewife.

218
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,840
My nest egg is enough

219
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,960
to support you for a lifetime.

220
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
From now on,

221
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,480
I'll

222
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,720
support you.

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,270
Don't yell here anymore, old man!

224
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,690
I...

225
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,040
Otherwise I...

226
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,690
I'll let you cook every day.

227
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,050
From now on,

228
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,490
you'll cook.

229
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,640
Our Lu family's woman...

230
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,720
Sister-in-law, don't keep blocking the TV.

231
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,730
What did I block?

232
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,490
Why are you like Ling Rui

233
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,320
who does the cleaning when something is bothering him?

234
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,290
Who is bothered?

235
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,280
I even won mahjong yesterday.

236
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,130
Who is bothered?

237
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,480
Seriously.

238
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,850
I've had enough of this.

239
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
What are you watching?

240
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,410
Let me take you to have fun.

241
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,120
Why did you turn it off?

242
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,770
What did he actually mean?

243
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,800
Is this kid

244
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
going

245
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,570
or not?

246
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,090
Just tell me something.

247
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,280
This immature kid.

248
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,600
Should I make the call or not?

249
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,640
Fangning.

250
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,130
Mom.

251
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,010
Is it enough? Do you want another bottle?

252
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,010
It's enough.

253
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,480
Fangning.

254
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,200
In fact, mom quite likes you.

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Although

256
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,850
you're a little different from us,

257
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,330
you still work so hard

258
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,450
to get close to us.

259
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,810
After all, I'm a mother.

260
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,650
There's something that

261
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,450
I can't say.

262
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,410
You...

263
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,600
You go and talk to Ling Rui.

264
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,920
Let him go to Germany.

265
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,730
Look.

266
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,040
As expected, he didn't tell you.

267
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,960
He didn't tell me either.

268
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,280
I found out about this

269
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,000
when I came across Professor Luo last time.

270
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,720
I guess

271
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,560
the reason he kept it from us

272
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,360
is that he's unable to tell you

273
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,000
because of what happened

274
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,880
to your company.

275
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,360
I'm worried

276
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,519
that if he doesn't talk to you,

277
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,960
he'll miss this opportunity.

278
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,400
He's been working so hard

279
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,160
for all these years

280
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,319
just to go to Germany.

281
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,600
He's my son.

282
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,610
I know him well.

283
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,130
Ling Rui

284
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,040
treats his family members

285
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,160
as more important than anything.

286
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,810
Not to mention that

287
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,600
you're now

288
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,760
in such a state.

289
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
It's impossible for him

290
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,640
to leave you alone.

291
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't want to interfere with your life.

292
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,610
I don't even want to...

293
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm afraid of affecting your relationship.

294
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,480
I want to...

295
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,810
I just want to...

296
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,330
Can you

297
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,120
talk about this with him

298
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,890
sometime?

299
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,600
Fangning,

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,930
what is it that

301
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,640
you're looking for me in such a hurry?

302
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,810
Are you...

303
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,570
Peng Bo.

304
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
Tell me.

305
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,240
Is it that Ling Rui

306
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,320
had already received

307
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,440
an offer letter from the German Institute?

308
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,690
I think that since he already missed it,

309
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,210
it's pointless to talk to him about this anymore.

310
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,280
So Ling Rui

311
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,930
really rejected it.

312
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,200
Ling Rui

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,770
had actually been hesitating

314
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,680
whether he wanted to go

315
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,610
after what happened to you.

316
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,840
So in the end

317
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,880
after negotiation,

318
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,410
it was changed to a video interview.

319
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,130
But I don't know

320
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:10,840
why he left halfway

321
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,250
through the interview on that day.

322
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,330
So

323
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,170
this was to no avail eventually.

324
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,130
Do you know

325
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,520
the date

326
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,000
of his interview?

327
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,890
It was a Friday.

328
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,680
-How do you expect me
-It's all her fault.

329
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,290
to look for work at this age?

330
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,480
It's all Lu Fangning's fault.

331
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,810
If it wasn't for her

332
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,160
to let our company compensate,

333
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,200
could LM Deer Sing Group

334
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,800
have ended up like this?

335
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,960
And for Infinity,

336
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,530
she invested so much in its early stage,

337
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:57,610
and that put so much

338
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,000
financial pressure to LM Deer Sing Group.

339
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,730
But Ms. Lu doesn't mean to let it happen either.

340
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,410
She doesn't mean so?

341
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,400
She has shares on her hands.

342
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,330
Of course it doesn't matter.

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,770
She'll be fine no matter what happens.

344
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
These people are the most despicable ones.

345
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,280
They just think about themselves

346
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,880
and totally disregard

347
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
other people's lives.

348
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,360
What happened?

349
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,400
Why is there a layoff all of a sudden?

350
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,370
Leader, I won't be sacked, right?

351
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,050
I have 25 years

352
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,000
of mortgage which hasn't been paid yet.

353
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,600
I just sent my money back home

354
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,880
last month.

355
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,250
Why is there

356
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,800
a layoff suddenly?

357
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,520
I won't be sacked, right?

358
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,930
Don't ask anymore.

359
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
I myself don't even know

360
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,450
if I'll be laid off.

361
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,650
That's right.

362
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,610
-What should we do in this situation?
-What should we do?

363
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,680
What should I tell my family?

364
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,400
I just got the job here.

365
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,600
I don't know what

366
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,570
my girlfriend will think of me.

367
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,160
Mr. Gao, after this layoff,

368
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,170
the company has successfully got through the brand crisis.

369
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,170
But there's still a 30% reduction

370
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,850
in the turnover.

371
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,570
Do you want to reformulate

372
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,880
the plan for the next quarter?

373
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,130
Gao Erfan.

374
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,570
Today's meeting ends here.

375
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,920
The meeting is dismissed.

376
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,530
Goodbye, Mr. Gao.

377
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,160
Gao Erfan.

378
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
Are you crazy?

379
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,690
After sabotaging LM Deer Sing Group

380
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,560
and suspending Infinity,

381
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,370
you even laid off employees and split up various departments.

382
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,810
How far will you go

383
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,930
to be satisfied?

384
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,890
It's a very reasonable business approach

385
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,480
to have asset restructuring

386
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,360
by eliminating departments with low production efficiency.

387
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,570
Are there any questions?

388
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,680
You'll ruin

389
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,130
the lives of thousands of employees.

390
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,480
Our grudges have nothing

391
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,850
to do with them.

392
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,520
So?

393
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,040
You want to be a heroine?

394
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,850
You want to save them?

395
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,490
Okay.

396
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,440
I'll give you a chance.

397
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Sell ​​all the shares

398
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
that Lu family owns

399
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,610
and leave LM Deer Sing Group willingly.

400
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,000
Then I might be magnanimous

401
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,170
and compassionate

402
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,480
and give you

403
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,360
a better price.

404
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,010
I'll definitely save LM Deer Sing Group.

405
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,410
I'll eliminate one more

406
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,520
department of LM Deer Sing Group

407
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,560
if you stay one more day.

408
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,440
Gao Erfan.

409
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,440
I just want you

410
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,560
to see for yourself

411
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
that how many people

412
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,530
will get hurt

413
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,570
because of your selfishness.

414
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,360
The first one is Ling Rui.

415
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,240
I know

416
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
that he gave up

417
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
the opportunity to go to the German Institute.

418
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,210
It was probably because of you.

419
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,640
You know

420
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
that after he gave up the chance this time,

421
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,010
there won't be the second one in his life basically.

422
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,530
Lu Fangning,

423
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
you should know perfectly

424
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,290
that what it means

425
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,730
for Ling Rui to go to Germany.

426
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,210
You should also know

427
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,210
that how much effort

428
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,400
he has put into it.

429
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,440
But you

430
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,760
forced him to marry you

431
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,090
and caused his career to be affected.

432
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,570
You foisted everything you wanted

433
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,850
on him.

434
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,680
This time is Ling Rui.

435
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,280
The last time was your sister.

436
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,530
How many people do you still want to hurt?

437
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
I'm very curious. I would like to ask you,

438
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
what's the difference

439
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,130
between the old you and now?

440
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
There's no difference.

441
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,920
You're always so selfish

442
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
and childish.

443
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,600
[Fangning, can you not be]

444
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,080
[this childish anymore?]

445
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,010
Sis,

446
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,850
can you come back

447
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,160
[Receiver: Sister]

448
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,080
to celebrate my birthday with me?

449
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,420
[Sending short message now]

450
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,450
Please.

451
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,850
I'll see you in that park

452
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,040
that we usually go

453
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,520
to at eleven o'clock tonight.

454
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,410
Do you know

455
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,210
the date of his interview?

456
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,290
It was a Friday.

457
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,040
Fangning.

458
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,090
You've done a great job.

459
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,210
I'll always be by your side.

460
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,410
It turns out

461
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,890
that I've always been like this.

462
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,480
Why do you look so pale?

463
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,000
Are you sick?

464
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,600
Dad.

465
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,050
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,880
In fact,

467
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,880
you shouldn't take the blame for what happened to my sister.

468
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
During all these years,

469
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,970
I didn't really hate you.

470
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,370
The person I hate is myself.

471
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,120
What happened to you?

472
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
It was my birthday at that time.

473
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,040
I asked my sister to come back, no matter what,

474
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,330
and let you make her stay on the spot.

475
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,770
I told my sister

476
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,450
that I didn't know

477
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,250
why you were there.

478
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,040
In fact, it wasn't true.

479
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
It wasn't like that.

480
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,120
I knew.

481
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,130
I knew that

482
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,610
you peeked at my phone.

483
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,040
But I wanted her to stay,

484
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
so I lied to everyone.

485
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,210
The person who killed my sister

486
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,890
was not you,

487
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,720
but me.

488
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,930
No.

489
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,520
It wasn't so.

490
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,210
Do you think I couldn't find her

491
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,490
even if you didn't say anything?

492
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
Ningning, I...

493
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,960
I don't know why you

494
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,640
want to tell me all these things today.

495
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,890
But this

496
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,370
was really not your fault.

497
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,120
It really wasn't so.

498
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,890
If someone

499
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,090
really had to take the blame,

500
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,570
then it'd be me.

501
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,720
No, Dad.

502
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,760
-No.
-It was my fault.

503
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,220
-Dad, I was selfish.
-If someone had to take the blame,

504
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,170
then it'd be my fault.

505
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,340
I killed my sister.

506
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,650
-It was not your fault.
-It was my...

507
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,560
-It was my...
-It was not like this.

508
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,600
-It was my fault.
-It was my...

509
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,560
-I was childish.
-It was an accident.

510
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,400
It had nothing to do with you.

511
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,210
I killed my sister!

512
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,880
No.

513
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,400
Ningning, listen to me.

514
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:37,920
I...

515
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,290
I may be really old.

516
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,330
Recently,

517
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,120
I've been here,

518
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
thinking about

519
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,290
a lot of things by myself.

520
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
Do you know?

521
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,930
I'd always been proud of your sister.

522
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,250
I hoped that she'd be my successor.

523
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,170
I tried hard to train her,

524
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,680
and she was also very obedient.

525
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,720
But I don't know

526
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
why so many things happened afterward.

527
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,600
I also tried hard to understand.

528
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,640
I...

529
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,320
I couldn't understand for a long time.

530
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,440
Later on,

531
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,680
I put the hope

532
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,890
in you.

533
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,240
Ningning, you've really

534
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,410
done well.

535
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,760
It's really good.

536
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,000
But I don't know

537
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,210
why I still pushed you.

538
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
Sometimes I thought

539
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,930
that subconsciously,

540
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,800
I wanted to give all

541
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,170
my love for your sister

542
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,040
to you. I...

543
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,650
So I hoped

544
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,160
that I could help you look for

545
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,010
a nice guy to get married

546
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,080
and have babies.

547
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
I hoped that you could be happy.

548
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,010
But when everything had been done,

549
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,000
I suddenly realized that you were so far away,

550
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,120
yet so close to me.

551
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,360
I... But I thought

552
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,610
that I really couldn't reach you.

553
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,320
In fact, thinking about your three siblings,

554
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,730
we should be envious of your little brother the most.

555
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,160
He lives such a pure

556
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,000
and clean life.

557
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,010
He just wants

558
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,450
to do whatever he wants to.

559
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,600
He doesn't care about what others say.

560
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,760
But looking at you now,

561
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,330
are you happy?

562
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,210
I... I kept foisting

563
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,250
the happiness

564
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,000
that I thought you should want on you.

565
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,850
I knew you didn't understand.

566
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,650
But I believed

567
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,130
that you'd understand one day.

568
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,720
But are you happy?

569
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,610
No.

570
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,690
I...

571
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,320
Ningning.

572
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,920
So for all of this,

573
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,240
