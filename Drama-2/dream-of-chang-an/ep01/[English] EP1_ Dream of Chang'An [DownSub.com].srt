14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,920
(On the 9th year of Tai'an,)

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,560
(the Xing empire was hanging
by a thread.)

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,360
(In order to get out)

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
(of the eunuch's control,)

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
(Emperor Wenzong of Xing planned
to reclaim his authority as the emperor.)

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,080
(Prime Minister's Residence)

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,199
Prime Minister.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
(Prime Minister, Wang Yang)
Something happened at the palace.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
(Prime Minister's Residence)
(Eunuch Qiu is leading the Shencai Army)

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
(in arresting the perpetrator.)

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,080
(You...)

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
(You'd better leave.)

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
This secret passage leads
outside the city.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
Official Wang.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,040
Hurry.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,480
Be careful.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,360
Open the door.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Open the door.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,160
Go.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,960
(Duke Chu, Eunuch Qiu Ziliang)

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,680
You Ma.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,680
Yes.

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,200
In the imperial court,

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
how many times did Wang Yang refute me?

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,640
Six times.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
One is to one hundred.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
And then

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
strike him 600 times
in dismembering him.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
Qiu Ziliang.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,440
For many dynasties,

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,200
did any eunuch

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
who monopolized power have a good ending?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Grandfather!

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
(To scare the officials,)

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,880
(Qiu Ziliang ordered people)

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
(to bring Wang Yang's corpse)

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
(to the downtown area,
and cut it in half.)

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,560
Your Highness.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,720
She's still alive.

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
(On January 4th,)

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
(Emperor Wenzong of Xing passed away.)

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,520
(His brother Qi Yan succeeded
to the throne.)

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,000
His Majesty has arrived.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,640
Kneel!

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,000
(Emperor Wuzong of Xing, Qi Yan)

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,960
(Eunuch, Cheng Huaizhi)

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,480
Godfather.

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,000
What's the matter?

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,040
Qi Yan, you like the black one?

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
But I think

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
that only purple

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
can match you.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
You're right, Godfather.

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Since you like the black one,

69
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,920
let's use that one then.

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Assist His Majesty in changing clothes.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Qi Yan.

72
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,040
You're all grown up now.

73
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
But I am

74
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
old.

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
How can you say that you're old?

76
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
Every land in the nation

77
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
belongs to the emperor.

78
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
Everyone within the nation's territory

79
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
works for the emperor.

80
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
From now on,

81
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,520
you are

82
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,920
the Xing empire's emperor.

83
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,160
Thank you, Godfather.

84
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

85
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,400
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

86
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:36,760
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

87
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,800
(Violet Bureau)

88
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
(Head of Violet Bureau, Cheng Xi)

89
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,920
(Violet Bureau, Li Rong)

90
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,680
Thank you for letting me win.

91
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,880
(Violet Bureau's Sword Bearer,
Cheng Ruoyu)

92
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,600
Wu!

93
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,280
Wu!

94
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
Look at these people.

95
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
We agreed to come out
and have fun together,

96
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
but they disappeared.

97
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,880
After going into the palace,

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
perhaps I'd never see

99
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
such a bright moon again.

100
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

101
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,920
You know me?

102
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Yes.

103
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,880
You're the one who can mobilize
the palace's imperial guards.

104
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,040
And everyone knows

105
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
that you like to hunt foxes
late at night.

106
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,480
Kill her.

107
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

108
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,960
Wait.

109
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm not an assassin.

110
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm from the Violet Bureau.

111
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,680
Your Majesty, please take a look.

112
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,680
I have the command token.

113
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,520
Your name?

114
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Cheng Ruoyu.

115
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,800
You're Cheng Ruoyu?

116
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes.

117
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,160
I'm the new Sword Bearer
of Violet Bureau.

118
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
My portrait has already been presented

119
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,840
to the palace.

120
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,440
You look just as foolish as you do

121
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
in the portrait.

122
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,600
(His Majesty looks so familiar.)

123
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
(I wonder where I've seen him before.)

124
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,400
What are you doing here?

125
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,280
I came here for a field trip.

126
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
I heard that the scenery here
is very nice.

127
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,160
And?

128
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
It's true.

129
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,120
And

130
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
I didn't know that Your Majesty

131
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,200
would come to hunt foxes here.

132
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,800
I came here first.

133
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
I just wasn't able to leave in time.

134
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,560
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

135
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,560
Scram.

136
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,760
(Hanyuan Hall)
Summon Violet Bureau's Cheng Xi

137
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,680
and Cheng Ruoyu.

138
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,040
Greetings from Cheng Xi, Your Majesty.

139
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,520
Greetings from Cheng Ruoyu,
Your Majesty.

140
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Cheng Ruoyu.

141
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,760
Come forward to receive
the imperial command.

142
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,800
Yes.

143
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,240
"In accordance

144
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,800
with the will of the heavens,

145
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
I govern in a civilized manner,

146
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,160
but quell rebellions with force.

147
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,560
And a Sword Bearer
is the imperial court's pillar,

148
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,920
and a capable official of a nation.

149
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,040
Cheng Ruoyu
from the Violet Bureau

150
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,800
is skilled in martial arts

151
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
and has good virtues.

152
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
She's chosen

153
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,240
to become

154
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
the 23rd

155
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,120
Sword Bearer of Violet Bureau.

156
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,160
With this arrangement,

157
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,960
you've been appointed.

158
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
That's the imperial command."

159
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

160
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,920
Rise.

162
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

163
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

164
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,920
Please bring the sword.

165
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
Cheng Ruoyu,

166
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
23rd Sword Bearer

167
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
of the Violet Bureau,
listen to the imperial command.

168
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,360
Yes.

169
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,080
The Qingguang Sword

170
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
was used by Madam Gongsun before.

171
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,440
It's given to you today.

172
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,720
I hope you can fulfill your duty,

173
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,160
protect the emperor and love the nation

174
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
and carry out your seniors' legacy.

175
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Don't fail

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
my trust.

177
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes.

178
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,599
Gods in heaven and earth.

179
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
Spirit of the sword.

180
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,400
My heart is like a sword,

181
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,920
suppressing the wicked
and eliminating evil.

182
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
My sword is like my heart,

183
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,359
protecting the nation
and being loyal to the emperor.

184
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,480
(Hanyuan Hall)

185
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,840
Congratulations, Sword Bearer.

186
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
Stop.

187
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Sir.

188
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,160
Are you going into the city?

189
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
Can you do me a favor,

190
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,200
and give me a ride?

191
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,920
(Chess of Generals Camp's Left Advisor, Yan Xiu)
I don't call the shots.

192
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,840
Who calls the shot then?

193
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,920
The Young Mistress.

194
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,640
(Chess of Generals Camp's Chess Overseer,
Qiu Yanzhi)

195
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,680
Miss.

196
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
Can you give me a ride?

197
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Get in.

198
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,200
Thank you.

199
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,320
(Qiu)

200
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
Thank you for giving me a ride.

201
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,680
By the way,

202
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,240
I have

203
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,520
some preserved fruits.

204
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,080
Here.

205
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,840
Try one.

206
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,720
It's very sweet.

207
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
You don't want one?

208
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
I've read that one too.

209
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
It's a good book.

210
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,640
She disguised herself as a man
and killed her enemy.

211
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
She endured hardships
for her retaliation.

212
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,040
What an amazing girl.

213
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,920
You... You just started reading it?

214
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,880
Well...

215
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,480
There's a twist in the ending.

216
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,480
It might not necessarily be the same
as what I said.

217
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,820
(Su's Textile)

218
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,360
We're here?

219
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,160
We're here.

220
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
We can only take you to this point.

221
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,920
Aren't you the beautiful

222
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,760
and kind lady?

223
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
Why are you here?

224
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
The Heavenly umbrella?

225
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
You're the Chess Overseer?

226
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,840
I'm Qiu Yanzhi,
Chess of Generals Camp's Chess Overseer.

227
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,080
Cheng Ruoyu.

228
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,280
We meet again.

229
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,080
Thank you, Ms. Yanzhi,

230
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,120
for giving me a ride the other night.

231
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
I was worrying about how to repay you.

232
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,760
I didn't expect to meet you here.

233
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,120
It's not a big deal.

234
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,920
Don't worry about it.

235
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,440
No.

236
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,360
I must still repay you.

237
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,200
What do you want to eat?

238
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,880
I'll bring you there.

239
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,160
(Duke Chu's Residence)

240
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200
It seems that your chess skills

241
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,680
improved a lot indeed.

242
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,960
You want to eat my elephant.

243
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,160
Then I'll

244
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
go one step ahead,

245
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,000
and eat yours.

246
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,120
I'll keep you in check.

247
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Nothing can be hidden

248
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
from you, Father.

249
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
It seems like

250
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,320
I lost again in this round.

251
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,400
By the way,

252
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,360
how did you meet

253
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
the new Sword Bearer?

254
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,600
I gave her a ride the other night.

255
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
But I asked someone to check.

256
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,320
She just went out of the city
for a trip.

257
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,520
What do you think of her?

258
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,080
She has a mischievous character.

259
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
We don't need to worry about her.

260
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,040
We can't take her lightly.

261
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,160
People like to pretend
in front of others.

262
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't get your plans ruined in the end.

263
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,040
So, Cheng Ruoyu

264
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,680
is the niece of Cheng Huaizhi

265
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,680
and Cheng Xi.

266
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,520
Yes.

267
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,760
Eight years ago,

268
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Cheng Ruoyu's parents died,

269
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
so she came to the capital
to depend on Cheng Xi

270
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,440
and got into the Violet Bureau.

271
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,280
I have

272
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,440
seen her before.

273
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,720
Your Majesty went
to the Violet Bureau?

274
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
When I went hunting for foxes
the other night outside the palace,

275
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,520
she was there too.

276
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,920
Why was she there?

277
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Investigate it.

278
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Yes.

279
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm exhausted.

280
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,320
Little Bell.

281
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
As the Sword Bearer,

282
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm being treated well.

283
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520
Look at my new room.

284
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,880
Little Bell.

285
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,520
Lotus petal pattern silver basin.

286
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,280
White porcelain amphora vase.

287
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,960
Even the poplar tree branch
for brushing teeth

288
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,280
is so intricate.

289
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Peach blossom cake.

290
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
It's so delicious.

291
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,600
What a pity.

292
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
You can't eat it.

293
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,520
Little Bell.

294
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,760
The palace is a dangerous place.

295
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,320
Even I

296
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,280
must be very careful.

297
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
You must hide well.

298
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,760
But I'll visit you often.

299
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,280
Your Majesty.

300
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,120
Grand Empress Dowager

301
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,880
told the private kitchen

302
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
to prepare these biscuits carved with flower
for you.

303
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Grand Empress Dowager heard
that you don't have

304
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,640
much appetite lately.

305
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,520
She's very worried.

306
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Don't bother Grandmother

307
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,360
about such a minor thing,

308
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,920
so that she won't worry.

309
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Your Majesty.

310
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,920
How would I dare to report that to her?

311
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,920
It's just that Grand Empress Dowager
is worried about you,

312
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,480
and she often asks about this.

313
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,520
By the way,

314
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
when she heard that the Sword Bearer

315
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
is Cheng Ruoyu,

316
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
she even admonished me.

317
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,680
Why?

318
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,080
Because

319
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,000
Cheng Ruoyu is my niece.

320
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,160
Your Majesty.

321
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
I swear to the heavens.

322
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,200
My niece, Cheng Ruoyu,

323
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,320
has become the Sword Bearer.

324
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
It's not because my sister and I

325
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
played favorites.

326
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,200
I believe you.

327
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

328
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,200
But I'm still very disappointed.

329
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,400
When Gongsun Jing was alive,

330
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,720
I met her several times.

331
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
She was a quiet lady.

332
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,280
I only heard her say three things.

333
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,160
First.

334
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,880
Someone reported

335
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
that the Violet Bureau's
expenses are too high.

336
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,520
What do you think?

337
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,240
(Violet Bureau's
22nd Sword Bearer, Gongsun Jing)

338
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
A Sword Bearer doesn't need to think.

339
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
Wherever Your Majesty's eyes are looking,

340
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,120
that's where the sword
would be pointed at.

341
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,840
Second.

342
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,820
(Clear mind and heart)

343
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,240
How are you feeling?

344
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,360
Is it a serious injury?

345
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,360
Protecting Your Majesty

346
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,000
is a Sword Bearer's duty.

347
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,920
(Emperor Wenzong of Xing, Qi Ang)
And getting injured on behalf of His Majesty

348
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,680
is a Sword Bearer's honor.

349
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
The third one

350
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
was the morning

351
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,600
when my brother passed away.

352
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,000
Are you willing to follow me?

353
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,000
A sword is just ordinary iron.

354
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,280
It differs with the one using it.

355
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,160
If the emperor is kind,

356
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,960
the sword is loyal.

357
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,360
If not,

358
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,280
the sword is hostile.

359
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Even if I'm a useless sword,

360
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,960
you

361
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,040
(still don't deserve me.)

362
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,440
A sword is just ordinary iron.

363
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,960
It differs with the one using it.

364
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,480
If the emperor is kind,

365
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
the sword is loyal.

366
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,120
If not,

367
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,360
the sword is hostile.

368
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Then for me,

369
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,960
someone restrained by eunuchs

370
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
and considering one of them as my father,

371
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,200
someone people claim
to have become emperor

372
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,760
after killing my brother,

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,680
what kind of Sword Bearer

374
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,240
can I have?

375
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,000
Your Majesty.

376
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,040
The Violet Bureau and I
highly depend on each other.

377
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,120
If I want the sword
to be a precious weapon,

378
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
I must be a wise emperor first.

379
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,280
Otherwise,

380
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,320
no matter how sharp the sword is,

381
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,320
it will backlash on me.

382
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,360
Huaizhi.

383
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,840
Yes.

384
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,000
Am I right?

385
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,080
Your Majesty.

386
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,640
I think

387
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,080
that you'll always be

388
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
the sword's owner.

389
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,320
The owner will always be

390
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,640
the one holding the sword.

391
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,600
Even if you use it against the sturdiest

392
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,480
and hardest object
in the world,

393
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,720
I believe

394
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,240
that the sword won't hesitate

395
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,600
even if it means crushing itself.

396
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,880
Your Majesty.

397
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,160
Rise.

398
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,600
On another day,

399
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,080
come with me to visit Grandmother.

400
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,080
Yes.

401
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Go.

402
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,280
Carefree Pill.

403
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,760
One pill, and you'll have eternal peace.

404
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,240
You've waited for many months.

405
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,480
It's finally done.

406
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,840
That's right.

407
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
He's tired.

408
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
He needs to rest.

409
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
After resting,

410
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
he won't keep pondering

411
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,600
about his dignity.

412
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,320
It's the will of the heavens.

413
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,840
That's why I want him to take this pill

414
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,080
for him to be carefree.

415
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,400
If the emperor is wise,

416
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,440
the officials are virtuous.

417
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,560
You mean...

418
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
Give it to Qi Yan.

419
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,360
Let him be

420
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,440
a carefree emperor.

421
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,400
Uncle.

422
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,760
What's wrong?

423
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,840
What's the matter with you?

424
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,720
Where did you go?

425
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,240
I...

426
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,560
You know what?

427
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,440
The Chess Overseer

428
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,120
requested to see His Majesty
early in the morning.

429
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
It's been over half an hour.

430
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,480
In the morning,

431
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
His Majesty asked me to go to Hanlin Academy.

432
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,920
You mean

433
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,480
the Chess Overseer...

434
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,440
The Chess Overseer

435
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,600
has been in there for so long,

436
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,880
and she's still inside.

437
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,320
Let me take a look.

438
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,680
You...

439
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,160
Your Majesty.

440
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,520
What is in it?

441
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,960
Carefree Pill.

442
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,560
It seems that you know what it is.

443
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
I don't need to say more then.

444
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,720
I'm already

445
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,880
very obedient to Godfather.

446
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,600
Why is he forcing me this way?

447
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,280
If you're really obedient

448
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,680
and loyal,

449
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,680
why do you insist

450
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,040
on keeping the Violet Bureau?

451
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
The female emperor established
the Violet Bureau.

452
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,600
They haven't made any major mistakes
in the past 100 years.

453
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
How can I just abolish it?

454
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Father

455
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,280
was bitten once,

456
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
and twice shy.

457
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
Please understand.

458
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,280
Besides,

459
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
Father is being considerate

460
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,480
to you this way.

461
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
After taking this,

462
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,160
you'll feel carefree.

463
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,360
You won't need to worry
about state affairs.

464
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,200
What will you do

465
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,320
if I don't take it?

466
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,760
I know that I can't do anything
about it.

467
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,720
I can only ask Father

468
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
to come here personally.

469
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,160
Your Majesty.

470
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,640
Your Majesty.

471
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,040
Your Majesty.

472
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,440
On my first day of work,

473
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,720
I accomplished something major.

474
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,680
Shouldn't you

475
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,080
reward me well?

476
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
What did you accomplish?

477
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
The side hall was on fire earlier.

478
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,760
I went to put out the fire,

479
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
and it was extinguished.

480
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,000
However,

481
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
I almost burned myself as well.

482
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,200
It's really so hot.

483
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,480
Do you have...

484
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,680
You have a drink here?

485
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,880
However,

486
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,680
this is too little.

487
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,920
Is there anything else...

488
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,360
Guards.

489
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,880
Guards!

490
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
Cheng Ruoyu.

491
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,000
Yu'er.

492
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,600
Yu'er.

493
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,159
Your Majesty.

494
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,679
Your Majesty.

495
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,520
I'll ask the imperial physician to come.

496
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,239
That's enough.

497
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,159
Stop pretending.

498
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,120
Your Majesty.

499
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,560
Uncle.

500
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,719
I'm fine.

501
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,040
I didn't drink that tea.

502
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,080
It's all here.

503
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,280
Your Majesty.

504
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,840
Did I accomplish something major?

505
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,600
Did you accomplish something major?

506
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,280
You were so rash.

507
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,080
You're utterly foolish.

508
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,600
I...

509
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,320
Your Majesty.

510
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,600
I disregarded my life to save you.

511
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
Forget about complimenting me.

512
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,000
Why are you even angry?

513
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,320
Aunt.

514
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,520
Your Majesty.

515
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,440
Yu'er.

516
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,960
What exactly happened?

517
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,320
I saw Qiu Yanzhi

518
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,240
forcing His Majesty to take
the Carefree Pill earlier.

519
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,120
Carefree Pill?

520
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,960
Your Majesty.

521
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,960
I didn't drink it.

522
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
I knew it's poisonous.

523
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,800
But I remember

524
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,840
you telling me

525
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,600
to think twice before doing anything.

526
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,960
That was why I thought

527
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,880
I must have

528
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,680
a fool-proof plan.

529
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,520
At that point,

530
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
my wisdom and ideas
kept flowing endlessly

531
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,480
like a river.

532
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,080
Then I...

533
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,840
It's not necessary

534
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,360
to say that.

535
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
And I pretended

536
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,160
to be very thirsty
after extinguishing the fire

537
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,760
and went inside to drink the drug.

538
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
Then I pretended to faint

539
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
and fooled Qiu Yanzhi.

540
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,160
Did I

541
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,760
do something wrong?

542
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,560
Even if you did it out of loyalty,

543
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
you were too rash.

544
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,880
What if you ruin His Majesty's plan?

545
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,920
Seek punishment from His Majesty.

546
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
Your Majesty.

547
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,920
I am guilty.

548
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,840
What are you guilty of?

549
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
I

550
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,920
think I did something wrong
out of good intentions.

551
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,040
You may

552
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
have been clever today,

553
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,920
but you only saw a small part
of the whole picture.

554
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,840
As the Sword Bearer,

555
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
you're my sword.

556
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,360
If it's used in the right way,

557
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm fortunate.

558
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,720
If not,

559
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,840
it will bring disaster to the nation.

560
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,240
Cheng Ruoyu.

561
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,960
I'll only

562
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,280
give you one chance.

563
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,520
Yes.

564
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,160
Aunt.

565
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,640
Since you're poisoned,

566
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,160
you can't go anywhere.

567
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,160
I...

568
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,400
This is ridiculous.

569
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Your Majesty.

570
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,280
I'm useless.

571
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,120
Rise.

572
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,880
In the past eight years,

573
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,600
the Violet Bureau was unable
to recover from a setback.

574
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,120
It failed the emperor's favor.

575
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,480
The late emperor passed away
with hatred.

576
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,920
Now,

577
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
we're seeing Your Majesty

578
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,920
in misery

579
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
and are unable to save you.

580
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,280
Everything

581
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,240
is my fault.

582
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,640
How can you say that?

583
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
You accepted the appointment
at a critical time.

584
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Even if you're sick,

585
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,960
you supported the Violet Bureau.

586
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,640
You persevered until now

587
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,520
even under Qiu Ziliang's coercion

588
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,640
and even gave me a new Sword Bearer.

589
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,440
That's already not easy.

590
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
I know

591
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,400
that Your Majesty is not satisfied
with Yu'er.

592
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,600
She's erratic and rash.

593
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,400
And her ideas are very whimsical.

594
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,040
But like me,

595
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,760
she's loyal to you.

596
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
What happened today

597
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,440
can prove that.

598
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,240
After Cheng Ruoyu joined
the Violet Bureau,

599
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
she was admonished many times.

600
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,760
But that was because

601
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
she wouldn't change

602
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,080
her mischievous character.

603
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,000
In other aspects,

604
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
there's really nothing bad about her.

605
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,280
And she has nothing to do

606
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,840
with the various forces

607
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,880
outside of the Violet Bureau.

608
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,680
I think that when you met her that day,

609
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,760
perhaps it was really a coincidence.

610
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,360
How can anyone in this world
be that innocent?

611
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,840
That's rather suspicious.

612
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
I understand.

613
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,800
I'll continue investigating her.

614
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,160
Your Majesty.

615
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,440
Since Yu'er has already taken

616
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
the Carefree Pill,

617
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,080
in the near future,

618
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,120
Qiu Ziliang

619
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,240
won't bring you a second one.

620
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,160
But it's easy to dodge open attacks

621
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,560
and hard to guard against the secret ones.

622
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
Your Majesty.

623
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,800
Have you decided

624
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,520
on what to do next?

625
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,640
Madam Cheng.

626
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,880
Do you have any good plans?

627
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,840
Instead of backing down,

628
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,440
what if

629
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,560
you take a chance?

630
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,600
160.

631
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,600
161.

632
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,960
1...

633
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,040
Aunt.

634
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,200
Can I move now?

635
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,880
You're poisoned by the Carefree Pill.

636
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,080
Even if I helped you in forcing

637
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,360
almost half of the poison out,

638
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,320
based on the damage in your body,

639
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,160
you can't use your martial arts skill
for at least half a year.

640
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,120
Didn't I tell you already?

641
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,640
I wasn't poisoned.

642
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,920
This drug

643
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,520
will help you act like you are.

644
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,360
What do you mean?

645
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
We must hide it from people

646
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,440
and gain more time.

647
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,920
Sir.

648
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,880
Cheng Xi had already

649
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,280
removed the poison
from Cheng Ruoyu's body.

650
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,880
But Cheng Ruoyu is badly injured.

651
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
For the next half year, she won't
be able to use her martial arts skill.

652
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,800
After taking

653
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,600
the Careless Pill,

654
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,600
one will be in low spirits

655
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,800
and feel weak.

656
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,360
This drug is a slow-acting poison.

657
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,040
It shouldn't have activated
in her body immediately.

658
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,720
Yes.

659
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,200
I especially consulted

660
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,920
the Grand Councilor of the Left.

661
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,160
He said that Cheng Ruoyu
is a martial arts practitioner.

662
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,200
She has sufficient vital energy and Qi,

663
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,360
and it's unavoidable for her
to get injured.

664
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,720
So she had taken various medicines.

665
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,800
Perhaps the poison

666
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
conflicted with other medicines.

667
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,600
That was why the poison immediately
activated in her body.

668
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,320
Cheng Ruoyu

669
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,000
indirectly ruined

670
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
my plan.

671
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm really unsure
if she's just pretending

672
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,760
or if she's really rash.

673
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
I was careless.

674
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,520
I wasted such a precious pill.

675
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm willing to be punished.

676
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,880
Cheng Ruoyu's martial arts skill
is useless for now.

677
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,320
The Violet Bureau's wings
are cut off.

678
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,600
It can be counted as a gain.

679
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,640
Rise.

680
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,280
As for Qi Yan...

681
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,200
Father.

682
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,960
Forgive me for being bold.

683
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Perhaps we don't need poison

684
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,240
to control Qi Yan.
