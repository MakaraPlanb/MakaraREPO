Ruoqing.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,520
I almost killed Qiu Ziliang

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,680
when I worked together with Han Yue.

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,000
I could've killed him.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,280
I still lost in the end.

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,320
General Han's sacrifice was in vain.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
Qiu Ziliang is still alive.

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
I should've known.

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
He is a devil.

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
I must make use of every chance I have

24
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,560
to strike him down

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,240
and finish him off.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,160
How could I

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
let him make a comeback?

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
Ruoqing.

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,400
It was my fault.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,040
Xiu got hurt because of me.

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,040
So did Ruoling.

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I've brought harm to all of you.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
It wasn't your fault.

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
It was.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
My arrogance led me here.

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,320
It was all my fault.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,920
Ruoqing.

38
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
Trust me.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
There is still hope.

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,640
There is still hope.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,640
Qiu Ziliang was indeed
in isolated meditation.

42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,600
But the medicine he made
had some issues.

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
Was it my uncle's doing?

44
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,360
Yes.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
He worked on it with the divine healer.

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Before that,

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,279
Qiu Yanzhi and Cheng Xi

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
managed to divide

49
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
the Shencai Army.

50
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,040
They made him believe there was a mole.

51
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,960
To draw the mole out,

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,520
he used his isolated meditation
as a cover

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
and sent the Left Chariot
on a secret investigation.

54
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,200
So the Left Chariot

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,600
came back to the Capital
a long time ago.

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes.

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
He's been hiding in Gao Ping's home.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,680
What answer

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
did he get from the investigation?

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Prince Guang,

61
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
Qiu Yanzhi, and Ling Ling

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
have been exposed.

63
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,520
But you are not exposed, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,960
We've been cautious

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
so far,

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
and they haven't suspected us.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
Prince Guang has been planning

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
since the Morning Dew Rebellion.

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,960
He might have started even before that.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
He managed to fool all of us.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
My teacher

72
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,480
once commented on Prince Guang's wisdom.

73
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,280
He said Prince Guang was cautious
and mindful with speech,

74
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
and had the quality of great wisdom.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
A man with great wisdom

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
would surely have great ambitions.

77
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,040
But why would he thwart Cheng Xi's plans

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,960
time and time again?

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,880
Why would he save your life?

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
He loves and cherishes

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
his own reputation.

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm nothing like him.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
To get where I am today,

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,760
I became the godchild of an evil man,

85
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
I usurped the throne,

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,800
and I became loathed by the world.

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,720
But he's different.

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,880
Guang means jade.

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,560
There can't be any stains on jade.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,240
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,200
At this point,

92
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
we should proceed with the next step.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Official Li has

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,120
everything in place.

95
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
He awaits Your Majesty's final order.

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,280
But I...

97
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,200
I am worried about Ruoling.

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,760
Your Majesty.

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
It's a critical time.

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,840
Don't let emotions ruin the plan.

101
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,200
She knew I had let the Wang family down.

102
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,600
Yet, she still risked her life for me.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
I owed her

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,280
too much for this lifetime.

105
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,760
That's because

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
she knew how her grandfather died.

107
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
Your Majesty, when you win,

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
all of this suffering

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
will truly be over.

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
(If you win,)

111
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
(Xing empire prospers.)

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,680
(If you lose,)

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,640
(Xing empire is doomed.)

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
(Tell me)

115
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,000
(that you can do it!)

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:08,800
(Yes.)

117
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Greetings, Prince Guang.

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Prince Guang,

119
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm glad you are here.

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Duke Chu wants you

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,320
to see the bride off as her family.

122
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,280
Miss Qiu, I can see you've been busy.

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,320
Even now, you still aren't groomed.

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,320
Did you forget you have a wedding today?

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,720
Listen up, everyone!

126
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
His Majesty's wedding is today.

127
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,040
The ban on wine has been lifted.

128
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,520
He granted us fine wine

129
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
so we could celebrate it for him.

130
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,920
There's enough for everyone!

131
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,560
Come on!

132
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Line up and get your wine!

133
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,120
(It's already)

134
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
(the day of their wedding.)

135
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Come on.

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
There's enough for everyone.

137
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Come on.

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
(I can never)

139
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
(enjoy a wedding wine like this.)

140
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Here's yours.

141
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,000
- Next!
- Okay.

142
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
Yan Xiu?

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Yan Xiu is in love with Yanzhi.

144
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,880
But Yanzhi is marrying His Majesty.

145
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,280
Come on!

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,640
There's enough for everyone!

147
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
Line up and get yours!

148
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,880
Come on!

149
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
Hold your wine.

150
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Here's yours.

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,280
Scram!

152
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
People like you don't deserve

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
to have His Majesty's wine!

154
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Get lost!

155
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,640
All of you, get lost!

156
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,760
There he goes again.

157
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,800
I'll never pity

158
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
a man like you.

159
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
These are all mine now.

160
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,400
How dare you steal my wine!
Get him!

161
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,960
Forget it.

162
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Consider I've avenged Madam Li.

163
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
Stop it.

164
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,040
All of you, stop beating him.

165
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
Cut it out!

166
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,220
(Left Advisor)

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
He's an official!

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,120
Leave, quick!

169
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,520
Leave!

170
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,680
Everyone, leave!

171
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
I can never enjoy

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,840
a wedding wine like this.

173
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,080
Yanzhi.

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800

are going smoothly for you,

I feel relieved.

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
It's them again.

223
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,200
An order from the Chess Overseer.

224
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,160
There's been a change in plan.

225
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,160
Hunt down Ling Ling,

226
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,280
and execute her.

227
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Yes!

228
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
Yanzhi will never want me dead.

229
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
What exactly happened?

230
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,400
Sir!

231
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
Pursue him!

232
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Take him out!

233
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,840
Yes!

234
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
You got everything you wanted.

235
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,440
Congratulations.

236
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,360
Dismiss.

237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,080
His Majesty and I are going to bed.

238
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,600
Yes.

239
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,360
Yes.

240
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,360
Going to bed?

241
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,800
Qiu Ziliang ordered me

242
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
to give you a Crown Prince
as soon as possible.

243
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,800
You even have power over

244
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,680
the royal bloodline of the Xing empire,

245
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
Duke Chu.

246
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,120
So...

247
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,760
I need a child.

248
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm afraid

249
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm in no shape...

250
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm afraid

251
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
I can't grant you that request.

252
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
In that case,

253
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
I shall take my leave now.

254
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,520
Wang Ruoqing.

255
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
I know

256
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
your true identity.

257
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,560
I beg your pardon?

258
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,000
My identity?

259
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,040
Aren't you Wang Ruoqing?

260
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,480
If you want me to be,

261
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
I can be her.

262
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,040
Just as the time Han Yue
needed me to be.

263
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,320
If I was Wang Ruoqing,

264
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560
I would...

265
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,360
Your Majesty.

266
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,840
Well?

267
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,920
Was it her?

268
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,720
It's the second time

269
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,080
I've come to confirm her identity.

270
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
She looks like her.

271
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,360
Your Majesty.

272
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,200
If you want to confirm

273
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,240
if she really is Ruoqing,

274
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,320
there is still another method.

275
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
What do you have in mind?

276
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,800
Miss Ruoqing was afraid of cats
when she was little.

277
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,640
Whenever she saw a cat,

278
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,880
she got rashes over her body.

279
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,560
But her sister Miss Ruoling

280
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,600
loved cats.

281
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,600
So Miss Ruoling could only

282
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
play with cat doll.

283
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,000
Little Bell.

284
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
That's right.

285
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
That's the doll's name.

286
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Its name was Little Bell.

287
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,440
Sir.

288
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
Li Deyun met with
the scholars after returning.

289
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
The group of seven discussed

290
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,360
more than an hour before leaving.

291
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,240
What did they discuss?

292
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,920
We don't know yet.

293
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,800
Sir.

294
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
Should we interrogate some of them?

295
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,200
Do not alert the enemy.

296
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,440
Keep tabs on them.

297
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,440
Let's see what Li Deyun has

298
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,440
up in his sleeve.

299
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,800
Yes.

300
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,360
Did you get the divine healer?

301
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,240
We got everyone

302
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,440
except the Left Advisor.

303
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,400
Good.

304
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,320
Dismiss.

305
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,520
Yes.

306
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm still alive.

307
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,640
Are you disappointed?

308
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,840
You will die sooner or later.

309
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,720
So,

310
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,080
what is the solution?

311
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,640
This is your design,

312
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,040
so you must know a way to undo it.

313
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,440
There is no solution.

314
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
Qiu Ziliang,

315
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
your demise is nigh.

316
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,840
Tian Shan.

317
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
I came here to sincerely

318
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,080
apologize to you.

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
I found out today

320
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,920
that your family

321
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,800
had died by my hands.

322
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,040
But that was ten years ago.

323
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,520
Drop the act.

324
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,080
You have no regard for human lives.

325
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,840
You will die a horrible death.

326
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,160
You will certainly die a horrid death!

327
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
Tian Shan.

328
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,040
You got my apology.

329
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,840
What you said

330
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,080
was a little hurtful.

331
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,680
Do you still have relatives
on your wife's side?

332
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
How about this?

333
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,400
For every day you refuse to tell me,

334
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
I'll kill one of them.

335
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,800
If you keep your mouth shut
for two days,

336
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll kill two of them.

337
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,200
I can take my time with you.

338
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,800
Let's see who wins in the end.

339
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Qiu Ziliang!

340
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,440
Qiu Ziliang! You're a demon!

341
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,880
You're a heartless wretch!

342
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,720
Teacher.

343
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
What is my uncle's motive?

344
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,640
The throne?

345
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,320
The world?

346
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,400
Or the prosperity of the Xing empire?

347
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,480
I can't

348
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,800
see through his mind.

349
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
If he bears ill intentions for me,

350
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,720
then how should I

351
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,680
deal with him?

352
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,840
Do I put him in jail?

353
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,440
Do I release him?

354
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,240

His Majesty arrives!

387

Your Majesty is still recovering.

388
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,560
There is no need to visit me.

389
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,040
Grandmother.

390
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
The rite must be upheld.

391
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,560
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.

392
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,120
I shall take my leave now.

393
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,120
Let me see you off.

394
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,720
Yanzhi.

395
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,720
Come.

396
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,240
Sit down.

397
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,200
Much obliged, Grand Empress Dowager.

398
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,120
Cutting down the quota of
Shencai Army's recruitment?

399
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,240
Yes.

400
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,440
Li Deyun has been discussing it

401
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,520
with his scholars

402
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,280
as of late.

403
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,360
Great.

404
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,480
While I was meditating in isolation,

405
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,080
these mindless clowns

406
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
were having the time of their life.

407
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,760
Sir.

408
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,880
The eunuchs

409
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,960
are awaiting your decision.

410
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,960
How should we stop their plan?

411
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,000
No.

412
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,320
Let them do as they please.

413
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Months' worth

414
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,920
of the military pay was embezzled.

415
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,240
Send out the words.

416
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,840
Tell the people Li Deyun
fills his own pocket with the money.

417
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,360
Not only is he corrupted,

418
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
but he is also going to cut down

419
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,520
the provision supplies.

420
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,080
But doing so

421
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
might cause an uproar in the army.

422
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,040
Then so be it.

423
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
It is time to get rid

424
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,400
of this pain in the neck named Li Deyun.

425
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,360
Yes.

426
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
Where is Cheng Xi?

427
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,120
In the ninth cell.

428
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,760
What message

429
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,160
did Your Majesty
ask Li Zening to deliver?

430
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,200
What about you?

431
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,720
What did you and my uncle

432
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,640
come up with before

433
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,320
our wedding?

434
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,960
Without a Crown Prince,

435
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,880
your life will be at risk.

436
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,400
Indeed.

437
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,680
So Your Majesty and Official Li

438
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,160
must proceed with haste.

439
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,960
What is your guess?

440
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,640
Nothing at all.

441
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
However,

442
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,640
Your Majesty are an Emperor.

443
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,720
You must carry out the way of Heaven.

444
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Why did the late emperor fail?

445
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,240
The Morning Dew Rebellion
was a conspiracy.

446
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,720
It wasn't the way of Heaven.

447
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,960
Your Majesty.

448
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,920
The time has come.

449
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,360
There is no Empress Regent.

450
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,160
There are no shady dealings.

451
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,600
In the new game of chess,

452
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,280
you are the overseer

453
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,000
for both Prince Guang and I.

454
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
For this round,

455
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,360
you and Qiu Ziliang

456
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,480
will battle each other fair and square.

457
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,440
You must feel curious

458
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,920
upon seeing me again.

459
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,040
You finished your isolated meditation.

460
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,880
Yes.

461
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,200
I was in isolated meditation

462
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,040
because there were things
I couldn't fathom.

463
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,280
But everything is clear to me now.

464
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,640
So I came out.

465
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,400
I never thought

466
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,200
you were Qi Qing's daughter.

467
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,920
After Qi Qing's failed coup,

468
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
you were exiled to a foreign land,

469
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,120
and saved by Cheng Huaizhi.

470
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,080
You followed Cheng Huaizhi

471
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,320
to Heng'an.

472
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,240
You talked Cheng Huaizhi into

473
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,640
working as a eunuch

474
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,960
so you and your half brother,
Prince Guang

475
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,600
from a different father

476
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,200
could reunite.

477
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,000
From there on,

478
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,160
you had been plotting to help
Prince Guang ascend to the throne.

479
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
After the Morning Dew Rebellion,

480
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,880
you instigated Emperor Wenzong

481
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,440
to pass the throne to Prince Guang.

482
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,480
As you wished, Emperor Wenzong
wrote a posthumous edict.

483
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,720
He ordered Han Yue to pass it
to Wang Yang.

484
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
But I was one step ahead of you.

485
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,720
I raided the Wang family's house.

486
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,480
I killed Wang Yang.

487
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,560
By the time you arrived,

488
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,760
the edict was nowhere to be found.

489
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,640
Prince Guang found out

490
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,120
that Wang Yang's youngest granddaughter
survived the attack.

491
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,920
He took her in.

492
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,800
After many considerations,

493
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680
he decided to hide her

494
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
inside the Violet Bureau.

495
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
You thought the Little Fish

496
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
could restrain Qi Yan,

497
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,720
so you agreed with the plan.

498
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,120
You even forged a new identity for her.

499
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,480
You gave her the name "Cheng Ruoyu."

500
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,520
- You knew everything.
- Of course.

501
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,000
If there is anything I want to know,

502
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960
I will know.

503
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,320
But you, on the other hand,

504
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,640
were kept in the dark.

505
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,160
Your beloved brother

506
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,160
never told you

507
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,800
Wang Ruoling wasn't the sole survivor.

508
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,840
Her older sister Wang Ruoqing

509
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,440
was also alive and well.

510
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,880
Wang Ruoqing lives?

511
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,120
Yanzhi.

512
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
Yanzhi is Wang Ruoqing.

513
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,640
Yanzhi

514
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,680
is Wang Ruoqing.

515
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,320
She's Yu'er sister.

516
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,480
You set Cheng Ruoyu

517
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,960
and Qi Yan up.

518
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,280
What if it was Cheng Ruoyu and Yanzhi?

519
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,840
Wouldn't they

520
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
make the story more interesting?

521
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,960
What do you want?

522
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,720
I bet you couldn't swallow

523
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,920
your disgraceful defeat.

524
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,720
Would you care for another round?

525
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,000
Let's make Wang Ruoling and Wang Ruoqing

526
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,880
be at each other's throat.

527
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Ruoling.

528
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,760
Yan Xiu.

529
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,040
What would make the Left Advisor

530
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,840
come here in person?

531
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
I was ordered by the Chess Overseer

532
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,640
to keep you safe.

533
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,160
Follow me to another path.

534
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,240
Do not go to Jiannan.

535
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,800
I don't need your protection.

536
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,120
I'm not changing my destination.

537
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,600
I only want

538
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
to take you to safety.

539
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,560
Stop following me.

540
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,960
Otherwise, you will face my wrath.

541
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,800
Ruoling!

542
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,840
Ruoling!

543
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,480
Ruoling!

544
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,520
- Come out!
- Aunt.

545
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,120
Yu'er.

546
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,080
You are in grave danger!

547
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,080
I just want to keep you safe!

548
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,760
Aunt!

549
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,320
Aunt!

550
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,200
Aunt.

551
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,040
What's wrong with you?

552
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,840
Are you hurt or is it...

553
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,400
I'll live.

554
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,760
I didn't come for you.

555
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,520
Since you're safe,

556
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,280
I have nothing to worry about.

557
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,280
Where are you going?

558
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,480
I'm sending Li Rong's ashes

559
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,000
back to her home.

560
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,800
So...

561
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,920
Did you give up on your obsession?

562
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm just a useless woman.

563
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,280
I have no obsession anymore.

564
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,640
Aunt.

565
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,840
Perhaps

566
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,160
I could escort you there.

567
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,440
Never mind.

568
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm heading for Dongchuan.

569
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,280
It's on the way to Madam Li's hometown.

570
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:31,840
Yu'er.

571
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,320
Thank you.

572
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
But after what we went through,

573
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,360
I can't bring myself

574
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,440
to be so intimate with you.

575
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,800
We should go our separate ways.
