Secondly,

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,480
you must take good care

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,240
of your other siblings.

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,920
Promise me this.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,760
Look at me.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
No matter what happens in the future,

20
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
no matter how difficult
the situation is,

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,360
you need to live on.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
You and your siblings must live on.

the Qi Family are alive,

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
the lineage of the Qi Family

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
will always be around.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Understood.

28
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,240
I...

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
All right.

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
I...

31
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I think I can do so.

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,400
Good.

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
Good boy.

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,640
Brother?

35
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,320
I...

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Your Majesty.

37
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
What about

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
the third question?

39
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,840
Your Majesty?

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,360
That is all I will ask.

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
As for the rest, you should
act as you deem fit.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,840
Brother,

43
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,680
how is your body?

44
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
They said they weren't able to
cure your illness.

45
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,040
I will

46
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,680
hold on until the day
you ascend the throne.

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
Qi Rong, you don't need
to worry about that.

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
Brother, please take care.

49
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
The Chess Overseer has ordered me
to send you two back to the palace.

50
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,120
Your Majesty.

51
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,480
Your Majesty.

52
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
I am fine.

53
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
I am fine.

54
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Your Majesty,

55
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,520
you insisted on seeing Prince An.

56
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
Actually, I knew you did it

57
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,240
because you wanted to ask him
about the third question, right?

58
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
The third question?

59
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Even I couldn't achieve the task myself.

60
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,920
There's no need for me
to criticise him because of it.

61
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
Can you take care of yourself?

62
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
Can you

63
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,760
take care of your siblings?

64
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
Thirdly,

65
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
can you win?

66
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,800
Tell me you can do it!

67
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,240
If you win,

68
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,560
the Xing empire will survive.

69
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
If you lose,

70
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,280
the Xing empire will be eradicated.

71
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,039
Wang Yang,

72
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,360
Zheng Lu,

73
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,360
me,

74
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
and the thousands of people

75
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
who had died during
the Morning Dew Rebellion,

76
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,679
all of us can die

77
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
for the sake of your victory!

78
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,159
So, tell me.

79
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Tell me you can do it!

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
I...

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
I will surely win.

82
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,560
Before Xuanzong's tomb on the Golden
Grain Mound now arch mature trees.

83
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,640
The stone castle by the Qutang Gorge is
surrounded by a deary field where grass rustles.

84
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Coming to an end is a lavish banquet
and a busy orchestra.

85
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,160
As music fades, sadness takes place,
over in the east the moon is up.

86
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Even with the bow in my hand,

87
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
and my ambition to shoot down the sun,

88
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,520
the dust stirs up

89
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,400
and the sky is dark.

90
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,120
This

91
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,760
isn't fair at all.

92
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
Since when did I say

93
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,600
that you can enter my room

94
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
at will?

95
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,360
Ever since Cheng Ruoyu

96
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,840
treated this place as her second home.

97
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Chess Overseer,

98
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
you would be mistaken

99
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
if you thought
I was trying to provoke you.

100
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,360
What is it then?

101
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,520
It's a reminder.

102
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,720
And,

103
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,600
you need to be grateful
to Qi Yan and Cheng Ruoyu

104
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
for visiting Prince An tonight.

105
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,560
That's how you were able to
avoid committing a grave mistake.

106
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,960
This serves as a reminder
to you as well.

107
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
I still remember

108
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,000
the time when I first saw you.

109
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
You looked at me,

110
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,080
you said my face looked familiar to you.

111
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,680
Back then, I was thinking

112
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
that you were

113
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
an annoying woman.

114
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,040
After that,

115
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,840
you were smiling

116
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
whenever I see you.

117
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,800
I was wondering

118
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,800
when that wretched smile of yours

119
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,120
will disappear.

120
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
But now,

121
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,080
not only do you not smile,

122
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,240
you always cry as well.

123
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Your Majesty,

124
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
you know what?

125
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
In this world, you're the only person

126
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,600
who can make me smile and cry.

127
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,960
Yu'er, I'm sorry.

128
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
Sorry for making you cry so often.

129
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
I'll stop crying.

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,680
I'll stop crying.

131
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
Your Majesty, as long as
you stay with me,

132
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
you'll be able to see my smile

133
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
forever.

134
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,200
I'll stop crying.

135
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,920
You should leave Heng'an City
together with Huaizhi.

136
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,560
With him taking care of you,

137
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
I won't need to worry
that much about you.

138
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,240
Your Majesty, I will never
leave your side.

139
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
No matter where you go,

140
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,440
I'll follow.

141
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,880
In this lifetime,

142
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,440
I was an emperor,

143
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
I was the son of a eunuch,

144
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,080
and I've made

145
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,320
a person like you, who love to smile,

146
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
cry because of me.

147
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,560
I have no regrets now.

148
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,640
I will never leave your side.

149
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,440
Yu'er,

150
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm sure you will

151
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,200
meet someone

152
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,720
who can make you smile

153
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
without making you cry in the future.

154
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,600
I...

155
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,560
I wish...

156
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,040
I wish you happiness.

157
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,080
Your Majesty.

158
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,640
I'm jealous.

159
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm jealous

160
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,520
of that person.

161
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm jealous of that person.

162
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
That person,

163
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,160
why can't it be me?

164
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,000
Why can't it be me?

165
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,640
We will always stay together.

166
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,200
There's no need for you
to be jealous of him.

167
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,160
Your Majesty, I'm sure

168
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,960
that person is you,

169
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
okay?

170
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,319

(Chess of Generals Camp)

204
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Are you saying

205
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,840
that the Right Chariot

206
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,240
knew that you were going to assassinate
Prince An tonight?

207
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,640
Yes.

208
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,240
But, I didn't realise

209
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,040
that he was spying on us at all.

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,320
You don't need to wonder how.

211
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,520
I assume it was just his prediction.

212
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
He didn't see it for himself.

213
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,560
What is he up to?

214
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,840
He only has one goal.

215
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,600
He wants to stop me
from assassinating Prince An.

216
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,200
And, he isn't doing it

217
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
for Qiu Ziliang's sake.

218
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
He's doing it for another person's sake.

219
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,680
For whose sake?

220
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,440
The Right Minister.

221
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,320
Sir,

222
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,760
the day after tomorrow
will be the appointment ceremony.

223
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,520
Both Prince An

224
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
and Qi Yan are still alive.

225
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,880
Yanzhi,

226
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Cheng Ruoyu,

227
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,880
Qiu Ziliang,

228
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,160
all of them do not need to die.

229
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,840
We can begin a new game
while they're still alive.

230
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,800
Have you decided to make this move?

231
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,040
Someone.

232
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Yes, sir.

233
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,280
Summon the divine healer here tomorrow.

234
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,080
Yes, sir.

235
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
His Majesty didn't assassinate
Prince An last night.

236
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
He just told Prince An what to do.

237
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,680
He returned to the palace after that.

238
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,240
So that's the truth.

239
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,640
That is within my expectation.

240
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,120
He is the same as the late emperor.

241
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,640
Both of them are useless fools
who are soft-hearted.

242
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,480
Forget about him.

243
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
He is going to die soon.

244
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,160
There's no need to hold it against him.

245
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,680
By the way,

246
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,520
what about Yanzhi?

247
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,920
Was she up to something?

248
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,360
No.

249
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,320
Continue to keep an eye on Yanzhi.

250
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,560
The appointment ceremony is tomorrow.

251
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
I don't want anything to go wrong.

252
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,640
Yes, sir.

253
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,280
What?

254
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Don't you have anything to tell me?

255
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
Sir, if I ask you

256
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,320
to put aside every other affair

257
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,920
and focus on meditating

258
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,240
so that you can neutralise the poison
within your body,

259
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,720
will you listen to me?

260
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,520
No.

261
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,240
I shall save my breath then.

262
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,240
But,

263
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
I do

264
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,360
have a strong feeling.

265
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
My Qihai meridian

266
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,800
has been twitching rapidly lately.

267
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,120
This is not the time for me
to isolate myself and meditate.

268
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
We can talk about that
after Prince An has ascended the throne.

269
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,000
These are the information I can get

270
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,640
regarding Nine and Lin.

271
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,960
These are all that I can get

272
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,120
within a limited amount of time.

273
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Do you really think

274
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
they're the subordinates
of the Right Minister?

275
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm just suspicious of them.

276
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,440
That's why I need to find evidence.

277
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,680
If that were the case,

278
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,280
Right Minister

279
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
is an unpredictable person.

280
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
Have you not found Cheng Xi yet?

281
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,680
Arrange an appointment for me.

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I need to see the Right Minister.

283
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,480
Understood.

284
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,720
Your Majesty,

285
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,480
are you awake?

286
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,120
How do you feel?

287
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
Do you feel much better?

288
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,760
Look at me.

289
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,160
I've fully recovered.

290
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,120
Your Majesty, you must be shocked.

291
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,160
Even I didn't expect

292
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,000
the Right Advisor to be
this good at bone setting.

293
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,360
Did the Right Advisor
treat your fracture for you?

294
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,600
And,

295
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,600
Your Majesty, she was the one
who gave you the medicine as well.

296
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,520
Your Majesty,

297
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,480
you're worried that
this may be a trap, am I right?

298
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,520
I was worried about
the same thing before.

299
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,240
But, Your Majesty,
I've tried your medicine for you.

300
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,720
The medicine is fine.

301
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,280
Your Majesty, I'm willing

302
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
to try everything for your sake

303
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,920
as long as you can survive.

304
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,760
Your Majesty,

305
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,080
instead of

306
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
waiting for the third person to save us,

307
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
why don't we save ourselves?

308
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,640
What do you say?

309
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,320
Are you sure you've fully recovered?

310
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
The appointment ceremony is tomorrow.

311
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,120
Eunuch Qiu has sent another 50 guards

312
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,320
to protect Prince An.

313
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,520
It is said

314
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
that the preparation in Changming Palace

315
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,760
is almost ready as well.

316
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,200
Now, we have no choice

317
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,680
but to wait for tomorrow's arrival.

318
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
What sound was that?

319
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
It's the tune for
the appointment ceremony.

320
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
Your Majesty,
I think I heard the same tune

321
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,320
during your ascension ceremony.

322
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,720
Tomorrow,

323
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
you'll be able

324
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,280
to hear the official tune again.

325
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,440
Your Majesty,

326
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,800
are you going to give up the throne?

327
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,120
Don't tell me you want me
to fight my brother for the throne?

328
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,040
Do you understand?

329
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,320
Do you regret your decision?

330
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,360
Are you happy?

331
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,760
As for me,

332
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,120
I am delighted.

333
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,400
Your Majesty, you...

334
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
I seem different, am I right?

335
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,520
Your Majesty, the past you
was like a bow.

336
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,200
You were always tensed up.

337
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,360
But, the current you are...

338
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,880
I was tensed up in the past

339
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,120
because I couldn't bear
to part with the throne.

340
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,920
I always wanted the best of both worlds.

341
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,960
But now, I'm willing
to part with anything.

342
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,320
And now,

343
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,400
I can finally win.

344
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,360
He doesn't want to see me?

345
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes.

346
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,760
The Right Minister said

347
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,640
that he will not see you

348
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,160
before the appointment ceremony

349
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
to avoid suspicion.

350
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,280
So,

351
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,360
not only does he want to protect me,

352
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,680
seems like he wants
to protect Prince An as well.

353
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,280
Prince An?

354
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,160
Stop!

355
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,280
Under Duke Chu's order,

356
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,080
the Imperial Clothing Bureau is here

357
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,680
to assist Prince An in choosing
the right size for his attire.

358
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

359
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Under Duke Chu's order,

360
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760
us from the Imperial Clothing Bureau

361
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
are to assist you in choosing
the right size for your attire.

362
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,680
Please come in.

363
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,200
We meet again,

364
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,120
Your Highness.

365
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,040
Our future emperor.

366
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,800
Wait.

367
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,840
I think I should address you
as my nephew.

368
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,400
You've laid your eyes on something
you weren't supposed to.

369
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,480
Don't you think

370
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,920
you should pay for the consequences?

371
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,680
Don't kill me!

372
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,520
It's you?

373
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,080
Both of you are actually
ganging up on me?

374
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Don't blame them.

375
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,600
Don't forget,

376
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,640
Right Minister was the one

377
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
who had picked
these warriors of sacrifice

378
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,320
for you.

379
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,320
Heartless ingrate.

380
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,160
I tried my best to help you
ascend the throne,

381
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,960
but now, you're saving
both Qi Yan and Qi Rong.

382
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,960
You're forsaking me instead!

383
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,360
We're stopping you

384
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,560
because we need to save you.

385
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,680
I would've succeeded a long time ago

386
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
if you didn't stop me

387
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,560
time and time again!

388
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,400
As for the rest of you,

389
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,440
return to where you belong.

390
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
How long do we have

391
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
before the appointment ceremony?

392
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,880
Less than 12 hours.

393
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,120
Let's visit Prince An.

394
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
At this hour?

395
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
I feel uneasy

396
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,600
for the past few days.

397
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,720
I need to visit him personally

398
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,000
just in case.

399
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,639
I need to keep watch over him.

400
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,360
Godfather.

401
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,840
This is great.

402
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,840
I won't need to be scared anymore
once you're here.

403
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,040
Why were you scared?

404
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,680
As long as I'm here,

405
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,520
nobody will be able to harm you.

406
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,760
Understood?

407
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,720
Come.

408
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,080
Let's play with the crickets together.

409
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,520
Come.

410
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,840
You'll be the emperor tomorrow.

411
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,800
You should be happy.

412
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
You must act like an emperor

413
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,840
if you are one.

414
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,800
You must cherish my kindness

415
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,640
and be grateful to me.

416
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
(Your Highness,)

417
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,960
if you wish for tomorrow's
appointment ceremony

418
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,480
to proceed

419
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,760
smoothly,

420
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,640
you mustn't tell anyone

421
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,640
that Madam Cheng was here.

Godfather.

443
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,200
Very good.

444
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,280
You look great.

445
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,000
You're the new emperor
of the Xing empire.

446
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,120
You're the hope of the Xing empire!

447
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,520
Good!

448
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,360
Come.

449
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm in a great mood today.

450
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,480
I'll put on your hat for you.

451
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,360
Come.

452
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,800
What do you think?

453
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Godfather,

454
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
will Brother attend
today's appointment ceremony?

455
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,600
Do you wish for him to attend it?

456
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,040
I do.

457
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,800
You are the new emperor.

458
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,080
You get to make the call here.

459
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,680
Someone!

460
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,960
Yes, sir.

461
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,000
Invite Qi Yan

462
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,440
and ask him to attend
the appointment ceremony.

463
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,000
Let him observe the ceremony

464
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,480
as I crown the new emperor.

465
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,360
Yes, sir.

466
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,520
Are you happy now?

467
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,960
By the way, Godfather,

468
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,600
the imperial crown seems pretty heavy.

469
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,400
Heavy?

470
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,240
Of course. You have to shoulder
the fate of the entire Xing empire.

471
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,360
There's no need to be afraid.

472
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,760
As long as I'm around,

473
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,760
