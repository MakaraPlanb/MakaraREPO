00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you doing?

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,720
No.

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,840
- Don't.
- Restrain yourself.

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,600
It turns out

18
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
that Han Yue's elite soldiers

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560
are lying in ambush
at Sunny Rain Pavilion.

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
We got them ready for Qiu Ziliang,

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
but he didn't fall for the bait.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
Your Highness Prince Guang.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,080
This way please.

25
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,400
Master.

26
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
What is the situation?

27
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
News leaked out.

28
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,560
Let's wait a bit more.

29
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,040
Take him away.

30
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
Yes.

31
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't touch me!

32
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,960
Uncle!

33
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,520
Qi Rong, don't be scared.

34
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
What do you want?

35
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,400
Qi Yan and Qiu Ziliang are already dead.

36
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,600
While the eunuch's faction

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
is gathered in Chess of Generals Camp,

38
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
we'll make you the emperor.

39
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
I don't want

40
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,360
a stolen position.

41
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
It's not up to you.

42
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
How is a puppet like me

43
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,320
different from the late emperor?

44
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,040
Do you really think

45
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
that I can't defeat you?

46
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,080
Cheng Xi.

47
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Qi Yan is dead.

48
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,880
Side with us.

49
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Let's help Prince Guang
ascend to the throne.

50
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,320
With Prince Guang as emperor,

51
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,320
it will be beneficial to the nation
and citizens.

52
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,280
And you'll accomplish great things
with the emperor.

53
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,480
What do you think?

54
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,520
What kind of person do you think I am?

55
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Return to the palace and get treated
by the imperial physician first.

56
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,360
Leave this to me.

57
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,360
No.

58
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
I'm not leaving.

59
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
Yanzhi can't leave all the more.

60
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,720
I know a secret passage

61
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,720
that leads underground.

62
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Underground?

63
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,240
Yes.

64
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,160
It's beside the woodshed.

65
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,520
Yanzhi took me there once.

66
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,520
Let's go.

67
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Come on.

68
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,680
Let's go.

69
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,560
General Han.

70
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,680
Chess Overseer would like to see you.

71
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
We'll talk after I get
Prince Guang back.

72
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Stop chasing after him.

73
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,760
We found Qiu Ziliang.

74
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Master.

75
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,440
Prince An is still here.

76
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,280
Watch him closely.

77
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,960
Yes.

78
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Is Qiu Ziliang dead or alive?

79
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Chess Overseer found him.

80
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,280
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

81
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,160
Come with me.

82
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Let's go.

83
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Your Majesty.

84
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,640
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

85
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Your Majesty.

86
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
Han Ding.

87
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
He's still alive.

88
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,560
Then I...

89
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,280
Take good care of His Majesty.

90
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,600
Your Majesty.

91
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
Hang in there a bit longer.

92
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
I'll bring you back to the palace.

93
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,240
No.

94
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Yu'er.

95
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
In Chess of Generals Camp...

96
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,360
In Chess of Generals Camp...

97
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,760
Chess of Generals Camp?

98
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,760
Wait in Chess of Generals Camp.

99
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Your Majesty.

100
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,920
Your Majesty.

101
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Your Majesty.

102
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,760
Your Majesty.

103
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Chess of Generals Camp.

104
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,920
Your Highness.

105
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,360
You've suffered.

106
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm fine.

107
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Good thing Madam Jade
sent news this time.

108
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
That was why we made it in time.

109
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,600
Thank you.

110
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,600
Where's Qi Rong?

111
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,440
We didn't have time to get him out.

112
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,280
Han Yue wants to use him as hostage.

113
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,680
He won't be in danger for now.

114
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,000
Where's His Majesty and Qiu Ziliang?

115
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
They're still buried underground.

116
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm afraid

117
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,640
that they might not have survived.

118
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,440
Your Highness.

119
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,440
If His Majesty is really gone,

120
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,880
you

121
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,720
can consider

122
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,080
Han Yue's suggestion.

123
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,840
Taking the throne as a rebel

124
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
and being under his control forever?

125
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,680
I won't do such a thing.

126
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Even if I ascend to the throne,

127
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
I want to be appointed to it

128
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,760
and be supported by the citizens.

129
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
It must be open

130
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,600
and legitimate.

131
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
But now,

132
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
the situation is still unclear.

133
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,200
We can't make a move rashly.

134
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Madam Jade.

135
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,520
Check on Yanzhi.

136
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,080
I keep thinking

137
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,480
that this matter

138
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,120
isn't over yet.

139
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,880
What are you doing?

140
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
Official Qiu told me
to ask you something.

141
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,960
What?

142
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
How does it feel

143
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,920
to lose again?

144
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
Qiu Ziliang.

145
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Grandfather!

146
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,680
- Sir.
- Sir.

147
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,680
Grandfather!

148
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Grandfather!

149
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,160
This is my Chess
of Generals Camp!

150
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
My mechanisms!

151
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
You want to kill me?

152
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
No way.

153
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,040
Legitimacy belongs to the victor.

154
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,320
I guess I lost again.

155
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,400
I admit defeat.

156
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,280
Han Yue.

157
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,680
You're a talented man.

158
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,920
As long as you follow me,

159
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,720
I'll consider

160
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
giving you another chance.

161
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
You want me to work for you?

162
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,200
Dream on.

163
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,920
Qiu Ziliang.

164
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
Prince An is still in my hands.

165
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm willing to use him
in exchange for someone.

166
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
I forced that girl

167
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,680
to do all of those things.

168
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,200
Consider it a good deed

169
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,599
before I die.

170
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,599
Release her,

171
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,520
and I'll give you Prince An.

172
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,400
Yanzhi.

173
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,839
You're very good.

174
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
The student

175
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,760
surpassed the teacher.

176
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,640
You sold him out,

177
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,840
yet he's asking me to spare you.

178
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
Back then,

179
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,480
I wasn't able to do that.

180
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,920
Why?

181
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Because

182
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm not Wang Ruoqing.

183
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,080
You're Wang Ruoqing.

184
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,240
You are.

185
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,400
Right.

186
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
I look a bit similar to her.

187
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
If not,

188
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,040
how can I make you trust me?

189
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,040
How can I lure you in?

190
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,120
(This is bad.)

191
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,920
(Qiu Ziliang is alive.)

192
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,760
Father.

193
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
Father, where are you?

194
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,720
Father.

195
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,120
Father.

196
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,480
Father.

197
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,760
Father.

198
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,000
Father, where are you?

199
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,760
Father.

200
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,120
What's the matter?

201
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,520
Do you

202
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,440
feel disappointed in seeing me?

203
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,160
Father.

204
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,280
Father, you're all right.

205
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
That's great.

206
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
Han Yue...

207
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,360
Han Yue kidnapped me.

208
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,600
In order to let him trust me,

209
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,960
I lied and said

210
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,800
that I'm Wang Yang's granddaughter

211
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,760
and successfully gained his trust.

212
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,320
But afterwards,

213
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,440
I kept being watched.

214
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
That was why it was hard for me
to do anything.

215
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,960
But earlier,

216
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,800
when Wang Lin brought people over,

217
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,880
Han Yue was busy
transferring Prince Guang

218
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
and had no time for me.

219
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,080
That's why I can come down to find you.

220
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,800
Father.

221
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Is that so?

222
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,120
I know

223
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,440
that you don't believe me.

224
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,720
It's fine.

225
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,040
I can prove it to you.

226
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Father.

227
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,560
Father.

228
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,080
Do you like

229
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
this gift?

230
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,440
Zhenwu's military advisor.

231
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,600
The mysterious mastermind.

232
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,520
Your old friend Han Yue.

233
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,400
I've brought him into your hands now.

234
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,120
So

235
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,280
there's no bomb?

236
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,840
There is.

237
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,560
It didn't bomb Eta Ursae Majoris?

238
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,520
It did.

239
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
But don't forget.

240
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
This is Chess of Generals Camp.

241
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,000
Father is more familiar with
the underground mechanisms than you.

242
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Before you activated the bomb,

243
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,520
he was already out of Ursae Majoris

244
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,160
and back to Alpha Ursae Majoris.

245
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,000
Sir.

246
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
His Majesty has many external wounds,

247
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
but aside from the one by his heart,

248
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
the others aren't serious.

249
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,960
His Majesty has a great foundation.

250
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
He'll recover after resting
for a period of time.

251
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,840
We want to return to the palace.

252
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,840
What?

253
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,480
How can you do that?

254
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,760
By carrying him out?

255
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,920
He can recover here

256
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,160
before returning to the palace.

257
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,320
Your Majesty, how are you feeling?

258
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,280
Much better.

259
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,480
But I don't quite understand.

260
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
Why won't Qiu Ziliang

261
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
let us return to the palace?

262
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
Because he wants to use this opportunity
to replace the emperor.

263
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,280
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

264
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm to blame for this.

265
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,200
Before,

266
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,720
I asked Han Ding to investigate
the materials used

267
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
for Chess of Generals Camp's dungeon.

268
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Rise.

269
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,760
That was why you were able to escape

270
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,280
through the flood-relief channel

271
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,680
before the explosion?

272
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

273
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,320
I was so worried.

274
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,160
Didn't Han Ding tell you?

275
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,040
No.

276
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Han Ding only said

277
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,440
that you know what you're doing.

278
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,480
Then Han Ding

279
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
told the truth.

280
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,640
- Chess Overseer.
- Chess Overseer.

281
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

282
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,560
Why did you return?

283
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,920
That traitor Qiu Ziliang

284
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,080
is very cunning.

285
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,000
I just made one mistake
and failed in the end.

286
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,400
You're my last hope.

287
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
You must go on living.

288
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
General Han.

289
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,920
Let's meet in the afterlife someday.

290
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,840
I'll do everything

291
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,320
to atone for my sins.

292
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,760
But I still don't understand one thing.

293
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,840
When you survived back then

294
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
and escaped to Zhenwu,

295
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,920
why didn't you get in contact
with the late emperor?

296
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
The late emperor only passed away
in the beginning of the year.

297
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
You had eight years

298
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,320
to find an opportunity
to return to the capital

299
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,360
and make plans
with the late emperor.

300
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Why didn't you return?

301
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
You were able to arrange
for the Zheng clan's descendants

302
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,200
to leave Heng'an,

303
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,640
for Zheng Wu to enter the palace,

304
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,440
for Handmaiden Hong to convince Zheng Wu

305
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
to assassinate Qiu Ziliang,

306
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,280
and use Ninghe

307
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
to come back for revenge.

308
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
All these moves

309
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,880
were so brilliant.

310
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,560
Where exactly

311
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
are your forces hiding?

312
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,600
Ruoqing.

313
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,520
You guessed wrongly.

314
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,640
I didn't save Zheng clan's descendant.

315
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,800
I also didn't save Zheng Wu.

316
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't know who Handmaiden Hong is
at all.

317
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm not as powerful

318
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,960
as you think I am.

319
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,480
In the past eight years,

320
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,360
I hid in Zhenwu.

321
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
I already exhausted myself

322
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,680
just to gain their trust.

323
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,320
How can I spare any effort
to control things in Heng'an?

324
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,240
It wasn't you?

325
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,960
Who is it then?

326
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
The third party.

327
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,520
Yu'er.

328
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,200
Where are you going?

329
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,520
I want to find an opportunity to go out
and get help.

330
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,560
There's no rush.

331
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,360
But Qiu Ziliang is already...

332
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,160
Your Majesty.

333
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I came late.

334
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,800
Please forgive me.

335
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Aunt.

336
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,080
I, Cheng Xi, came late.

337
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,160
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

338
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,360
That was why I said

339
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,240
that there's no rush.

340
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
You're not the third party?

341
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,960
Then who exactly is it?

342
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,920
I don't know either.

343
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,520
Come to think of it,

344
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,400
he facilitated

345
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,720
every step I made.

346
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,680
Chess Overseer.

347
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
The soldiers went to Almond Forest.

348
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,960
They didn't find Prince An.

349
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,640
It seems like he also knows

350
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,000
everything you're doing.

351
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Everything you do

352
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,120
is in his control.

353
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,720
Ruoqing.

354
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,760
I've failed miserably indeed.

355
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,000
Let me die a quick death

356
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,520
for the sake of our common belief.

357
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,200
General Han.

358
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Since I didn't know
the situation clearly before,

360
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,000
I didn't dare to make a move.

361
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
That was why I went to Li Zening

362
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,400
to discuss this matter.

363
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,120
We really figured something out.

364
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
Who is Li Zening?

365
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,920
Li Deyun's daughter.

366
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
Official Li is in Huainan.

367
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,800
He's so far away.

368
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,920
That was why I visited Ms. Li first.

369
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,520
Ms. Li gave me a sachet.

370
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I think

371
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,520
it's the contingency plan His Majesty

372
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
and Official Li agreed on.

373
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,160
What is that sound?

374
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,840
The Violet Bureau

375
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,440
is here to take Your Majesty back
to the palace.

376
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,440
I heard

377
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,760
that Duke Chu fell for a trick

378
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
and was buried in the abandoned house.

379
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,560
I know, right?

380
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,600
Now, Duke Chu is saved.

381
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,280
His Majesty is very happy.

382
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,560
That's why he brought Violet Bureau

383
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,000
to personally visit Duke Chu

384
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,160
to thank the heavens' blessing.

385
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,640
His Majesty is so nice

386
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
to Duke Chu.

387
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,000
I know, right?

388
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,480
So,

389
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,840
now, everyone knows

390
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,800
that His Majesty went out of the palace

391
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,080
to visit you.

392
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Since he came to visit me,

393
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,800
he must return.

394
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,720
He must return if he left.

395
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,600
I can't believe

396
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,280
he thought of that.

397
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,880
Father.

398
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,840
Do we know

399
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,560
where Prince An is?

400
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,880
I was just about to tell you

401
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,680
that Han Yue cut off his own veins
and died.

402
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,880
It caught us by surprise,

403
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
and we didn't get anything out of him.

404
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,680
He's dead?

405
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,040
It's because you didn't watch him well.

406
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
Please punish me.

407
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,280
100 floggings.

408
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Yes.

409
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
Han Yue repeatedly

410
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,160
provoked me.

411
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
He died just like that.

412
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,040
This won't do.

413
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,520
Cut him into pieces,

414
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,040
and feed him to the dogs.

415
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes.

416
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
Why did you stop?

417
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,240
Sir.

418
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,720
The entourage has come inside.

419
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,680
How do we deal with them?

420
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,960
Sir.

421
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,720
This is an urgent report from Zhaoyi.

422
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
Zhao Yi military commissioner
Liu Congjian

423
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,040
stationed troops in the borders

424
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,880
and is ready to create trouble.

425
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,800
It seems like he got the late emperor's
posthumous edict.

426
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,680
What?

427
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520
The late emperor's posthumous edict?

428
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,320
It's just a rumor.

429
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
We haven't confirmed it.

430
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,120
Forgive me for being bold.

431
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,200
Please let Qi Yan return
to the palace first.

432
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,720
First,

433
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,000
Prince An's whereabouts
is still unknown.

434
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,200
Second, the citizens know

435
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,520
that His Majesty came here.

436
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
If we don't release him,

437
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
rumors will arise.

438
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,120
You're not afraid of rumors,

439
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,560
but you must guard against Liu Congjian

440
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,680
in taking the opportunity
to cause trouble.

441
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,920
That old fart.

442
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,880
Back then, he was even clamoring
for the elimination of evil officials

443
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,320
and going against me.

444
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,320
After all these years,

445
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
I can't believe that he got
the late emperor's posthumous edict.

446
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
I'll investigate right away

447
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
if this matter is true.

448
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,960
Open the door then.

449
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
What about His Majesty?

450
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Isn't he in the carriage?

451
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,720
Yes.

452
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,719
Right Advisor.

453
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,360
Yes.

454
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,760
Tell Right Minister to see me tonight.

455
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes.

456
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,000
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

457
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,000
- Long live, Your Majesty!
- Long live, Your Majesty!

458
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,120
Your Majesty.

459
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,639
Wait for me in the carriage.

460
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
I'll be right back.

461
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,719
Yanzhi, I want to talk to you.

462
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,960
I have nothing to say to you.

463
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,600
Thank you.

464
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,719
For what?

465
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,639
For killing Han Yue?

466
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,720
Thank you for convincing Qiu Ziliang

467
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,920
to let His Majesty return to the palace.

468
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

469
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,560
In being able to return to the palace,

470
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,680
you must thank

471
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,720
your fearless aunt

472
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,120
and those

473
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,480
covetous royal retainers.

474
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,680
You're a good person,

475
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,520
why are you following him?

476
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,880
If you just want

477
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,200
to tell me these nonsense,

478
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
I have no time for you.

479
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,640
Are you really not Wang Ruoqing?

480
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,800
My name is Qiu Yanzhi.

481
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,240
I really think

482
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,320
that she's Wang Ruoqing.

483
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,600
If she is,

484
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
back then,

485
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,800
I personally shot her.

486
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,440
I'm her enemy.

487
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,720
If she's not,

488
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,960
Qiu Ziliang and I are at odds
with each other.

489
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm still her enemy.

490
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
His Majesty is going back to the palace.

491
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,800
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

492
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,040
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

493
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,320
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

494
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,320
Your Majesty is the emperor.

495
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,600
The one appointed to the throne.

496
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
The one people support.

497
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,280
No matter how powerful Qiu Ziliang is,

498
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
he can't do anything about those things.

499
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,360
Good thing Aunt found Li Zening

500
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,600
and got the sachet.

501
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Your Majesty!

502
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,720
You're finally back.

503
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
Thank heavens.

504
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,240
Hurry.

505
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,560
Get some rest.

506
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,560
Your Majesty.

507
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,120
Great.

508
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,920
This is great.

509
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,560
Well... Yu'er.

510
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
How is your injury?

511
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,880
I'm fine.

512
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
But His Majesty...

513
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,560
Uncle.

514
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,520
Summon the imperial physician

515
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,320
to check on His Majesty.

516
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
There's no need.

517
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,400
Your Majesty.

518
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,800
Your Highness Prince Guang.

519
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,760
You're back too.

520
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,200
Your Majesty.

521
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,560
Let me check on your injury.

522
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,480
Uncle.

523
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,520
This is an urgent situation.

524
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,800
Let's talk about
important matters first.

525
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Is there any medicine

526
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,920
that can invigorate me immediately

527
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,360
to leave the palace on a horse?

528
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,800
You want to leave the palace?

529
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,480
Where are you going?

530
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,440
I'm going to release Liu Misha
back to Zhenwu.

531
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,200
Stop.

532
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,400
Your Highness Prince Guang.

533
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm going back to House 16.

534
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,400
Yes.

535
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,280
Your Majesty.

536
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,800
Actually, I can handle

537
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,280
this matter too.

538
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm worried about the border's safety.

539
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,520
I must go there personally.

540
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,280
Even if the heavenly pill
has an amazing effect,

541
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
it's not healthy to take a lot of it.

542
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
I can handle it.

543
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,720
But you...

544
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,600
I can handle it all the more.

545
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,240
Your Majesty.

546
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,520
- Princess.
- Your Majesty.

547
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
His Majesty is injured.

548
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,800
He's hurt?

549
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,400
Your Majesty.

550
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,400
Where is your injury?

551
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
Tell me.

552
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,800
Does it hurt?

553
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,440
Misha.

554
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,560
I'm fine.

555
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
While Qiu Ziliang hasn't noticed yet,

556
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,080
return to Zhenwu.

557
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,160
But...

558
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
But after I return,

559
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,960
how do I tell my father
about these things?

560
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,320
I...

561
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,080
Tell him the truth.

562
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm the one who should be sorry.

563
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Father and I trusted the wrong person

564
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,160
and got so many soldiers killed.

565
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,760
We even almost got you killed.

566
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Not only aren't you
holding us accountable,

567
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
you're even risking your life
to release me.

568
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
I can't bear to leave you.

569
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,120
I can't bear it.

570
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,800
Your Majesty.

571
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
I'll listen to you.

572
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
I'll return to Zhenwu.

573
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,520
What I told you will always be valid.

574
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,040
Think about it carefully.

575
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,120
Take good care of His Majesty.

576
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,480
Don't let another woman take him away.

577
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,920
What did she tell you?

578
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,040
What did she tell you

579
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,840
that will always

580
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,040
be valid then?

581
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,840
Your Majesty.

582
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,520
Your injury...

583
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,800
