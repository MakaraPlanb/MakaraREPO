=Episode 7=

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,440
Since Zheng Wu appeared,

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
I've become suspicious.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
Who helped her get into the Palace?

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,280
Who forced her to attempt
an assassination on Qiu Ziliang?

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,720
And who arranged the assassin

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
to attempt an assassination
on Your Majesty at the Wine Shop?

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,200
You're saying

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,520
that Qiu Yanzhi did all of that?

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,440
Yes.

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,880
Qiu Ziliang is suspicious of
Violet Bureau,

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
so he arranged for Zheng Wu
to come here.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Who knew that the real training

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
occurred in Yuzhen Hall?

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,960
There was nothing suspicious
with Violet Bureau itself.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,520
That was why

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,880
she forced Zheng Wu to perform
the assassination,

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,360
and use this opportunity

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,400
to openly investigate the Violet Bureau.

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,200
Right.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,640
But they didn't find any proof,

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,760
so they decided

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
to arrange

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
a Wine Shop assassination.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,440
For the Wine Shop's murder incident,

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,400
Mrs. Cai should have
investigated Zheng Wu.

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
But because of my protection,

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,960
I commanded the Commissioner
of the Capital

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,840
to keep the matter low-key,

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
so they think

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,000
that Cai's Wine Shop is mine.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
They arrested Madam Cai

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
and tortured her.

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,520
I had no choice but to send
a warrior of sacrifice

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,280
to kill her.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
Yet I fell into their trap

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
and led them in finding Yuzhen Hall.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
In my accounting records,

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,400
a big sum of money

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
went into Cai's Wine Shop.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,200
I

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
also went there to investigate.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
And I ended up following your niece

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
to Yuzhen Hall as well.

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
Madam Cheng.

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,880
If I didn't

59
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
find out myself,

60
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
how long are you planning to hide this?

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,400
You're incredible.

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
You're just a fifth-rank official,

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
and you used my money

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
to support 300 warriors of sacrifice.

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
What exactly are you planning to do?

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,040
I committed a crime.

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm willing to accept punishment.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,920
After Yu'er recovers,

69
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,200
let her take over Yuzhen Hall.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,760
I...

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
But Your Majesty,

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,480
hasn't Yu'er already been fired?

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,079
Starting today,

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,080
Cheng Ruoyu is reinstated
to her position.

75
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
And she will manage both
the Violet Bureau and Yuzhen Hall

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
and become a real Sword Bearer.

77
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Yes.

78
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,480
I...

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,400
Your Majesty.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
Can you let me check Yu'er's pulse?

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
My medical skills are crude.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm afraid I can't do anything.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,320
But I have an idea.

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
I don't know if I should tell you.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Go ahead.

87
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
His Highness Prince Guang
has great medical skills.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
I wonder if I can

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
bring Yu'er to him to get treated.

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,440
Sure.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll bring her there myself.

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,720
Madam Cheng.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Starting today,

94
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
stay in the Violet Bureau

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
and focus on recovering.

96
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,160
You may go now.

97
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,200
Yes.

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,440
Rosa rubus.

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
That's the herb's name.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
It looks very ordinary,

101
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,360
yet it has such a unique name.

102
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
They say that there was a tribulation
in heaven back then.

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,800
Lightning struck,

104
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
and everything was eliminated.

105
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
Only this herb remained.

106
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Buddha smiled

107
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
when he saw it.

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,200
It's so tenacious.

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
It's quite similar
to that person inside.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Yu'er needs to rest to recover
from her injury.

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
Let her return to the Palace

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
only after she recovers.

113
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
As for Qi Rong,

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
I already asked someone

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,960
to send him

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
to a relative in Huainan.

117
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
In the next few days,

118
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
don't act by yourself

119
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
as much as possible.

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Thank you, Uncle.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,280
I won't drink anymore.

122
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,000
You're suspecting Prince Guang?

123
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,560
I gave it some thought.

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,600
If the Violet Bureau
fights with the Chess of Generals Camp,

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
and Qi Yan fights with Father,

126
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
the one who will benefit the most

127
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
is Prince Guang.

128
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,000
But even if His Majesty is killed,

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,120
he won't be the emperor.

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,160
There are still a bunch

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,520
of young royal princes
who are easier to control.

132
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
What if

133
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,440
he has the posthumous edict?

134
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,320
If Prince Guang has the late emperor's
posthumous edict,

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
then if Qi Yan

136
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,520
and Father bring destruction
upon each other,

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,960
he can legitimately ascend
to the throne then.

138
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
But the problem

139
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,960
is that he couldn't have gotten
the posthumous edict.

140
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,520
Why not?

141
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
If he couldn't get it,

142
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
he'd think that Father

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
has it.

144
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
But Eunuch Qiu doesn't.

145
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,040
We know that,

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,320
but others don't.

147
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,520
Guards.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Chess Overseer.

149
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,200
What have Prince Guang been doing
in the past few days?

150
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,360
Chess Overseer.

151
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,760
Aside from tending to plants,

152
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,040
he never left the cottage.

153
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,760
He only has one servant

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,640
named Yuan Du,

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
who goes down the mountain
to buy necessities sometimes.

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,840
Yes.

157
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Since Prince Guang is suspicious,

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
let's go and sound him out.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
When I insisted on living in seclusion
in the mountains back then,

160
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
the late emperor asked me why.

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
I told him

162
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
that it was to distance myself
from strife.

163
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,840
Back then, the late emperor

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,280
may have been under house arrest,

165
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
but his life wasn't in danger.

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
But Your Majesty is different.

167
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,280
Since you ascended to the throne,

168
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
you were in danger numerous times.

169
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
Do you know why?

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,080
Why?

171
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,600
Two reasons.

172
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,760
First.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,280
You have martial arts skills.

174
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,400
Second.

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You like using martial arts.

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,160
If the late emperor found out
about what happened to Qi Rong,

177
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,760
he'd surely send people

178
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
to check the Chess of Generals Camp.

179
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Yet Your Majesty

180
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
went there yourself.

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,160
And for the Yuzhen Hall,

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,200
Your Majesty shouldn't

183
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
have personally gone there.

184
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,040
Around me...

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
You still have me.

186
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
I'll go back.

187
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Uncle.

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you serious?

189
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,640
But Your Majesty,

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,160
you can't act with undue haste
regarding this matter.

191
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
You must find the right opportunity.

192
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,040
Uncle.

193
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
My heart is like my blood,

194
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,760
forever loyal to Xing.

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,960
My blood is like my heart,

196
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,080
it swears to kill traitors.

197
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Thank you, Uncle.

198
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,320
Come in.

199
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
Since you're here,

200
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
have some tea.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
Are you skilled in martial arts?

202
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,680
No.

203
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Then how did you know that I'm here?

204
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,960
Every being has a soul.

205
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Every plant and tree has life.

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,440
Every plant, tree,

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,520
and beings here

208
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
has senses.

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
It's poisonous.

210
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,640
Which poison is it?

211
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
It's deadly.

212
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,100
(Chess of Generals Camp
You Ma)

213
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,000
You Ma.

214
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Why are you here?

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm monitoring things.

216
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,120
Out in the open?

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,320
I've learned from you.

218
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Actually,

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,000
I just came to see

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,320
if you're doing well lately,

221
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Prince Guang.

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,160
Thank you for your concern.

223
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,320
Please report to Chess Overseer

224
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
that I'm doing well.

225
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,440
I'm not up to no good.

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,600
It's not up to you to say

227
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
whether you're up to no good or not.

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,840
It's up to us to determine that.

229
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,320
He's not up to no good.

230
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,520
You Ma.

231
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,840
The late emperor said

232
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,000
that if the new emperor
has high aspirations,

233
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,960
I can assist him.

234
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,520
My heart is like my blood,

235
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,200
forever loyal to Xing.

236
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
My blood is like my heart,

237
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
it swears to kill traitors.

238
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,840
Do you believe

239
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,600
what they said?

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
(If I can't even find)

241
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,440
(who the enemy is)

242
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,720
(and why they're here,)

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
(how can I use my sword)

244
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,680
(to protect the emperor?)

245
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,920
(Protecting the emperor's safety)

246
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,400
(and preventing you from encountering
another assassination attempt)

247
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,000
is what a Sword Bearer

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,400
should do.

249
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,800
I don't believe

250
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,840
what they said.

251
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,600
But you're different.

252
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,680
Maybe

253
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,720
you're really my Sword Bearer.

254
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,240
Guards.

255
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,480
Your Majesty.

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Find someone to repair this sword.

257
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,800
It must be exactly the same as before.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Yes.

259
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,120
His Majesty has arrived!

260
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
Greetings, Grandmother.

261
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,360
Come.

262
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,560
Have a seat.

263
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
I heard that Your Majesty is finally
attending the imperial court meeting.

264
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes.

265
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,000
Before that,

266
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
there's something

267
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,800
I want to discuss with you.

268
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,600
How strange.

269
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,880
If you need anything,

270
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,120
shouldn't you discuss it with Duke Chu

271
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
instead of me?

272
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,200
I can only consult you with this matter.

273
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Your birthday

274
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
is next month.

275
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
I

276
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,280
would like to let Prince Guang come back

277
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
to make arrangements for this.

278
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,520
I don't like Qi Chen.

279
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
I know.

280
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I can't believe

281
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,040
that you're letting someone I dislike

282
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,360
arrange my birthday banquet.

283
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,400
Grandmother.

284
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
I also know

285
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
that Prince Guang's birth mother

286
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,200
betrayed you back then

287
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,280
and had Prince Guang.

288
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
That's why

289
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,280
you've never liked him.

290
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
Do you like him?

291
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,480
All these years,

292
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,880
the rumors outside

293
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,800
are very spectacular.

294
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
They say that he should be the emperor.

295
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320
They say

296
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
that Emperors Muzong and Wenzong

297
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,480
both wanted to pass the throne to him.

298
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,320
They say that you usurped his empire.

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,640
Grandmother.

300
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,400
That is why

301
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
we should let him return all the more,

302
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,440
so that the whole nation can see

303
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,760
who exactly

304
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,560
acts like an emperor more.

305
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,920
Grandmother.

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
I need someone to assist me.

307
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,440
It's more like you're bringing a fox
into your house.

308
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,480
At least this wolf

309
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,760
is part of the family.

310
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
With regards to how those rumors

311
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
leaked out,

312
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
I think you know that

313
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,200
more clearly than me.

314
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,320
That's right.

315
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,800
I asked people to spread it.

316
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,680
Why?

317
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
Because I don't like him.

318
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,920
I wanted your father to kill him.

319
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,760
How can the son of a maid
who washes feet

320
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,280
deserve such favor?

321
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,280
Father didn't kill him.

322
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,120
My brother didn't kill him either.

323
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,680
I

324
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
won't kill him as well.

325
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,360
I know

326
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,320
that you don't like him.

327
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,440
Qiu Ziliang also knows
that you don't like him.

328
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,160
That is why

329
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,800
he'll surely agree for him
to return to the capital.

330
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
Please

331
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
help me.

332
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,400
Your Majesty can make the decision
on your own.

333
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,920
You don't need to discuss with me.

334
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you, Grandmother.

335
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
Madam Xiu.

336
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,360
Grand Empress Dowager.

337
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
He's the fifth emperor

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,320
in my lifetime.

339
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,520
He's also the one

340
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,920
I can't read the most.

341
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,000
I heard that His Majesty and Duke Chu

342
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,080
are not in good terms now.

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Back then,

344
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,760
when he acknowledged Duke Chu
as his godfather,

345
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,320
I knew

346
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
that this day would come.

347
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Did you see his eyes clearly?

348
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,880
They're an eagle's eyes.

349
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Duke Chu is proud to be
an eagle taming expert.

350
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,680
But this eagle

351
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,920
will blind him in the end.

352
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,600
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

353
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,400
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

354
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,600
Rise.

355
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

356
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Next month is

357
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
Grand Empress Dowager's 70th birthday.

358
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,240
Officials.

359
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
Any ideas on how we'll make
the arrangements?

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,950
(Shencai Army Commander Yuan Xing)

361
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,360
Grand Empress Dowager

362
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,600
told me this morning

363
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,680
that it doesn't have
to be a big celebration.

364
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
But she wants to benefit the citizens.

365
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,920
I gave it some thought.

366
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,560
What if we give out clothes and food

367
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
and celebrate together
with the citizens?

368
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,760
But who will handle

369
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,720
this matter?

370
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Duke Chu.

371
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Any suitable candidates?

372
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,560
How would I dare to comment

373
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
about Grand Empress Dowager's birthday?

374
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,240
Your Majesty should make the decision.

375
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,560
I thought about it.

376
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,360
What if

377
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
we ask Prince Guang to do it?

378
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,040
What do you think, Duke Chu?

379
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,080
All right.

380
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,480
Let's do that.

381
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,320
Officials, anything else
you want to report?

382
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,880
GrandFather.

383
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Why is Qi Yan

384
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,200
summoning Prince Guang back?

385
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,520
Prince Guang
and Grand Empress Dowager Guo

386
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
have never gotten along.

387
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,920
Why would His Majesty let Prince Guang

388
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
make arrangements
for the birthday banquet?

389
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Right.

390
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
(Shencai Army Commander Jiang Ding)
Do you know about this?

391
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Summon You Ma.

392
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,920
Come.

393
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,720
When did Qi Yan

394
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
speak with Prince Guang?

395
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,040
Yesterday

396
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,480
at 1pm.

397
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,080
You were there?

398
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,400
Yes.

399
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,360
It's really just

400
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,520
for Grand Empress Dowager's birthday,

401
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
and nothing else?

402
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,160
Yes.

403
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,440
All right.

404
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,440
I got it.

405
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
You may go.

406
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,720
Father.

407
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,920
I heard that Prince Guang's birth mother

408
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
was Grand Empress Dowager's maid.

409
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,040
She seduced the emperor
when Grand Empress Dowager was pregnant.

410
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,240
This matter

411
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,600
has always been like a bone

412
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,400
in the throat for her.

413
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,800
That's interesting.

414
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
How can His Majesty let Prince Guang

415
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
handle this matter,

416
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,320
and why did Prince Guang agree?

417
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,800
What do you think?

418
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,920
I think there's only one possibility.

419
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,640
They want to work together

420
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,720
*They want to work together

421
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,120
against you.

422
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,760
I've asked You Ma
to monitor Prince Guang

423
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,360
for eight years.

424
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,240
He always said that he behaves properly.

425
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
The imperial court even sends
new provincial military commissioners

426
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,320
every four years.

427
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,200
Because if someone

428
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,320
is with another person for too long,

429
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,640
he doesn't only develop feelings,

430
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,520
he understands him.

431
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,880
You mean

432
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,520
Prince Guang bought off You Ma?

433
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't dare to speculate about that.

434
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,040
Is there a problem?

435
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,200
I came to say goodbye.

436
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,920
They're suspecting you?

437
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,880
It's fine.

438
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,920
We can't blame them
for being suspicious.

439
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,640
You've been monitoring me
for many years,

440
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
yet you couldn't report anything

441
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
about me.

442
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
I have a clear conscience.

443
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,280
Yes.

444
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,400
You have a clear conscience.

445
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
Me too.

446
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,600
This is for you.

447
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,560
Thank you

448
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,560
for letting me live in peace

449
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,640
for so many years.

450
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,920
No.

451
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,040
Take it.

452
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,280
You've been staring at it
for so many years.

453
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,280
I know that you like it.

454
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,080
Grand Councilor of the Left.

455
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
(Slow and stead wins the race)

456
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,680
Grand Councilor of the Left.

457
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,520
(Chess of Generals Camp
Grand Councilor of the Left)

458
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,440
Grand Councilor of the Left.

459
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
This lady is so pitiful.

460
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,560
Her husband bullies her,

461
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
and she has bad parent-in-laws.

462
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
Liu Yi.

463
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,160
You must save her from disaster.

464
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,280
What a shame.

465
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,400
I originally wanted

466
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
to give Grand Councilor of the Left

467
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,800
the new "Legend of Liu Yi".

468
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
Since he's not here,

469
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,840
I can only give it to someone else.

470
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,080
Wait.

471
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,360
It turns out that you're here.

472
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,000
Let me see.

473
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,000
(Legend of Liu Yi)

474
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,200
Tell me.

475
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
What do you want?

476
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,280
Rosa rubus.

477
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Rosa rubus?

478
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,080
Its stem is poisonous.

479
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,040
You'll have hallucinations
if you smell it.

480
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,080
You'll slowly die with a smile
if you eat it.

481
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
It causes hallucinations?

482
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,120
Does the person poisoned with it knows?

483
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,200
Do you know about Zhuangzi's dream?

484
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,440
Zhuangzi isn't sure if he dreamed
of becoming a butterfly,

485
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,000
or if the butterfly dreamed
of becoming him.

486
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,280
Is there a way to know

487
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,080
if someone is poisoned

488
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,480
with rosa rubus?

489
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,520
Of course.

490
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,880
It's the same with addiction to pills.

491
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,120
The person needs to continue taking it.

492
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,280
Once he stops,

493
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,600
he'd feel unbearably hot.

494
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
The consequences are unimaginable

495
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,000
if it's not handled well.

496
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,640
Thank you, Grand Councilor of the Left.

497
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,320
(Slow and stead wins the race)

498
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,000
(Chess of Generals Camp)

499
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,640
That's not right.

500
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,400
What's not right?

501
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,240
Everything.

502
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,880
Even if rosa rubus is rare,

503
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
I only found out that it's poisonous

504
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
after asking Grand Councilor of the Left.

505
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,240
But there must be others
who know about this.

506
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,680
If Prince Guang is controlling
You Ma this way,

507
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,880
then Prince Guang should have
destroyed it immediately

508
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,560
after he left.

509
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Why did he openly give him one?

510
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,400
(Chess of Generals Camp)

511
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Didn't he tell you that herb is fishy?

512
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,320
If you don't smell it,

513
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,360
it feels unbearable.

514
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,920
But there are many reasons
for feeling unbearable.

515
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,560
Who would suspect an herb?

516
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Could it be

517
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,600
that there's nothing wrong

518
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,800
with that herb,

519
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
and You Ma is not being
controlled either?

520
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,360
There must be something fishy
with that herb.

521
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,360
I'm sure You Ma is being controlled
by it too.

522
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,160
However,

523
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,720
he openly sent such a big loophole

524
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,240
in front of me.

525
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
Does he have other intentions?

526
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,640
Other intentions?

527
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,960
He's sounding me out.

528
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,000
Rosa rubus.

529
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,040
He wants to see me.

530
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,320
Why are you up?

531
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,160
Savior.

532
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,720
Does it still hurt?

533
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,520
Not anymore.

534
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,000
However,

535
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,440
before fainting,

536
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,360
His Majesty was reprimanding Aunt.

537
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
I can't accept it

538
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
when I think about that.

539
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Don't worry.

540
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,720
Madam Cheng will be fine.

541
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,760
His Majesty won't give her a hard time.

542
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,720
Drink your medicine.

543
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,320
Thank you, Savior.

544
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
Drink it slower.

545
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,880
Savior.

546
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,760
When will my injury

547
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,240
be fully healed?

548
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,600
You're in good health.

549
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,600
Your injury isn't a big deal.

550
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,840
But we must treat

551
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,000
your headaches.

552
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,120
Cheng Ruoyu.

553
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,320
Who are you?

554
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,680
Who are you?

555
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,240
Was it really just a dream?

556
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,840
Savior.

557
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,240
How did I get here?

558
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,400
I brought you here.

559
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,120
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

560
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,400
Cheng Ruoyu.

561
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,840
It turns out that you and Uncle
have known each other for a long time.

562
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,480
I once fell into the hands
of human traffickers.

563
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,680
Fortunately, he saved me.

564
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,400
That was how I was able to find Aunt.

565
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,000
Everything in this world

566
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
is a result of karma and destiny.

567
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,880
I saved Yu'er.

568
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
Yu'er saved you.

569
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,920
It's all karma.

570
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
Go on chatting.

571
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,680
I have to go out for a while.

572
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,560
It's yours.

573
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Mine?

574
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
Open it.

575
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,560
Wasn't the sword broken?

576
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,560
It was remade.

577
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,640
I told you that I'll give you one
as compensation.

578
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,760
You said you'll give me 100 of them.

579
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,480
Is that so?

580
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Then return this to me.

581
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,040
There's no need.

582
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,040
I'm not greedy.

583
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,000
I just need one.

584
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,840
One is fine.

585
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,400
Since you got the Qingguang Sword,

586
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,800
let's go.

587
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
Where are we going?

588
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,600
Have you forgotten?

589
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,120
I told you.

590
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,080
You'll take over the Violet Bureau

591
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
and Yuzhen Hall from now on.

592
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,520
So

593
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,080
you can return to the Palace
with me now.

594
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,920
What's the matter?

595
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,760
You don't want to go back?

596
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,080
Your Majesty.

597
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,760
Don't you

598
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,560
trust Aunt anymore?

599
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,800
What do you think?

600
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,639
Then why do you trust

601
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,120
her niece,

602
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,120
me?

603
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,199
You're different from your aunt.

604
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,920
I gave up on Cheng Xi,

605
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,080
yet I kept Huaizhi.

606
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,920
It's also because

607
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,239
Huaizhi is different from Cheng Xi.

608
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,239
Even if you're relatives,

609
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,639
I'll consider you two separately.

610
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,040
However,

611
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm not confident.

612
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,680
I entered the palace

613
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
to become a maid in Violet Bureau

614
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,000
not because I like it,

615
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,680
but because Aunt is there.

616
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,240
I practiced the sword

617
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,760
to become the Sword Bearer

618
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,480
not because I like it too,

619
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,840
but because Aunt wanted me to do it.

620
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm by your side

621
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,760
because Aunt

622
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
told me to protect you.

623
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,560
Everything I did

624
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,720
was for Aunt.

625
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,320
If Aunt told me to go against you,

626
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,200
I...

627
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,960
So

628
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,200
you'll turn your sword towards me?

629
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
I don't know.

630
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,200
Maybe I will,

631
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,320
maybe I won't.

632
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
That's why

633
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
I'm not confident.

634
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,880
Your Majesty should ask
someone else to do it.

635
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,800
Why are you choosing me?

636
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,040
Why is it me?

637
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,520
Why me?

638
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,080
What is an emperor?

639
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,800
An emperor

640
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
is someone who doesn't have a choice.

641
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,800
I don't have a choice.

642
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
And my fifth brother,

643
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
you don't have a choice either.

644
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm very happy

645
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
that you spoke honestly.

646
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,240
It's very rare for me to hear
honest words anymore.

647
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,960
No one tells me the truth.

648
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,200
In that case,

649
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,480
keep this sword well.

650
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,560
Your Majesty.

651
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,360
Your Majesty.

652
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,120
Stop acting on your own anymore.

653
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,840
What happened this time

654
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
surely has something to do with Wu.

655
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,120
You must continue investigating.

656
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,040
I don't need to.

657
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
But can you really bear

658
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,440
the repeated assassination attempts?

659
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,000
You won't be safe each time.

660
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,640
Mind your manners.

661
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,920
Your Majesty.

662
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,880
If you agree

663
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
for me to continue investigating
Wu's case,

664
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,960
I'll return to the palace with you.

665
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,040
Only you

666
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,120
can clear Wu's reputation.

667
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,200
And only you

668
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,040
can give Aunt

669
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,280
an opportunity to make up
for her mistake.

670
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Also,

671
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,840
even if I don't deserve to be
the Sword Bearer,

672
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,280
Qiu Yanzhi

673
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,560
doesn't deserve to be
the Chess Overseer all the more.

674
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,040
The Violet Bureau is my home.

675
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,840
I can't let it fall

676
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,920
into Qiu Yanzhi's hands.

677
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,040
Aside from me,

678
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,880
no one can help you

679
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
deal with Qiu Yanzhi now.

680
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,520
You're quite confident

681
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,680
about yourself.

682
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,560
In saying that,

683
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,120
that means he agrees?

684
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,000
Your Majesty.

685
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
If you agree,

686
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,160
can you tell me

687
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,240
the truth?

688
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
What do you want to know?

689
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Did you really release Wu?

690
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,360
Yes.

691
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Does she know then?

692
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,560
She doesn't.

693
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
In front of everyone,

694
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,080
I shot an arrow towards her.

695
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,720
Not long after she fainted,

696
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,160
I wore a mask,

697
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
treated her, and sent her outside
of Heng'an.

698
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,200
Why did you spare her?

699
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
You want to know the truth?

700
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,640
I was testing the arrow.

701
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,720
What?

702
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,480
I want to know

703
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,360
if I intentionally deviated a shot
using a specially-made arrowhead,

704
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,080
causing one to suffocate and appear dead,

705
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,240
can she be saved?

706
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,680
Why?

707
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,080
Because if that trick works,

708
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,680
it will be very useful.

709
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Then why

710
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,600
did you allow Wu to die?

711
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,240
Your Majesty

712
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,200
is afraid that when they check
Wu's wound,

713
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,080
they'll find out that you spared her?

714
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,800
Yes.

715
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I spared her life,

716
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,920
yet she had a death wish.

717
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
What's the use of keeping her alive?

718
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,040
Cheng Ruoyu, listen carefully.

719
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,520
You can investigate the case,

720
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,600
but you must take good care of yourself.

721
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,440
And you can't disregard your life.

722
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,840
Why do you keep staring at me?

723
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
Fireflies?

724
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,120
Fireflies.

725
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,440
Your Majesty, look.

726
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,600
Fireflies.

727
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,080
There are so many of them.

728
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,480
Your Majesty.

729
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,080
Look.

730
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,760
(I can only tell you half
of the truth now,)

731
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,480
(and keep the other half.)

732
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,120
(Someday,)

733
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,800
(I hope that you can really make me
tell you everything.)

734
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,120
- Greetings, Sword Bearer.
- Greetings, Sword Bearer.

735
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,240
This is the detailed list

736
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,680
of Yuzhen Hall's 300 members.

737
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
They're in Mount Qi?

738
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,520
Yes.

739
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
After things have quieted down,

740
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,680
find a way

741
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
to get them back to the capital.

742
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
How would I let them obey me then?

743
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,760
The Qingguang Sword is the token.

744
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
Whoever has that sword

745
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,080
is their master.

746
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,000
That's why

747
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,680
I already planned

748
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,320
to let you manage all of these
since before.

749
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,160
Aunt.

750
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,600
There's one thing I want
to confirm with you.

751
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,600
What is it?

752
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,880
Did you

753
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,440
really send someone to kill Mrs. Cai?

754
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,440
Yes.

755
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,720
Why are you...

756
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,520
Why am I so heartless?

757
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,760
Open these musical scores.

758
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,820
(Song of Sword)

759
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,320
In order to escape the notice of others,

760
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,360
Yuzhen Hall's actions

761
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,560
were all written in code.

762
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,680
Assist means slow.

763
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,320
Hay means quick.

764
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,120
Omit means stop.

765
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Like this one,

766
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,920
three assists, two hays, five omits.

767
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,480
It means three people going slowly,

768
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,320
two people going quickly,

769
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
five people stopping.

770
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,800
What about this?

771
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,880
Death.

772
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,440
The Yuzhen Hall isn't the Violet Bureau.

773
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,520
The people there

774
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,120
have all received the harshest training.

775
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,040
They're ready to die for their mission
at any time.

776
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,040
In the same way,

777
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,160
you must also have that realization.

778
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,680
What does the Sword Bearer use
to protect the emperor?

779
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,280
Her sword?

780
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,640
No.

781
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,120
Her life.

782
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,360
You're his second life.
