00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,160

you want your doubt answered.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,040

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,560

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
It's delicious.

193
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
(To my niece Yu'er)

194
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
(To my niece Yu'er,)

195
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,840
(I know you hold)

196
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,360
(a fair amount of grudge against me.)

197
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
(You don't understand
why I chose to rebel)

198
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,000
(and made Qi Yan my enemy.)

199
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,920
(I even stooped as far as
siding with Qiu Ziliang.)

200
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,080
(As you might know by now,)

201
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
(I am the daughter of Qi Qing,)

202
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
(a descendant of Qi Hu.)

203
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,920
(I am Prince Guang's half-sister
of the same mother.)

204
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
(But I betrayed Qi Yan)

205
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,880
(not only for myself,)

206
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,240
(but also for you.)

207
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
(I see you as my own niece)

208
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,400
(and spent eight years
looking after you.)

209
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,520
- Prince Guang...
- Madam Cheng, come forth.

210
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,600
Come.

211
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,680
You wanted me to adopt a kid

212
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,600
into the Violet Bureau.

213
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,200
Is this her?

214
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,280
She has strong bones.

215
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
She has potential in martial arts.

216
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,040
But it seems like

217
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,960
she is dying.

218
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,880
Will she get well?

219
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,760
What are you doing?

220
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,600
I want you

221
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,680
to swear on your life

222
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
that you will never tell anyone
of her identity.

223
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,520
And you must

224
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,600
look after her

225
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,440
and raise her

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,800
as one of your own.

227
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,880
Who is she?

228
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,200
(Your surname was Wang.)

229
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,320
(Your name was Ruoling.)

230
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,960
(You were the granddaughter of
Chancellor Wang Yang.)

231
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,760
(During the Morning Dew Rebellion,)

232
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
(Qiu Ziliang and Qi Yan raided
the Wang Residence.)

233
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,440
(Qi Yan took Wang Yang's life.)

234
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,720
(He shot an arrow)

235
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
(that pierced right through you)

236
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
(and your sister Wang Ruoqing.)

237
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,440
(The scar on your chest)

238
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
(was his doing.)

239
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,120
(You survived the wound)

240
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,480
(and was saved by Prince Guang.)

241
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,360
(To avoid Qiu Ziliang's hunt for you,)

242
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
(I gave you a different name)

243
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,160
(and raised you up.)

244
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,080
(Seeing you)

245
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,720
(reminds me of Official Wang.)

246
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,800
(He was a loyal)

247
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,680
(and extraordinary statesman.)

248
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,640
(Yet he died a horrible death.)

249
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,080
(You are)

250
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,960
(what's remained of the Wang family.)

251
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,160
(You have no other related kin)

252
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,400
(in this world.)

253
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,120
(I couldn't bear to tell you.)

254
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,560
(But I can't let you sink any deeper)

255
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,800
(and become Qi Yan's weapon.)

256
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,520
(You lost your family because of him.)

257
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Qiu Yanzhi!

258
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,040
Let me out!

259
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
Qiu Yanzhi!

260
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Let me out!

261
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,040
I must talk to Cheng Xi!

262
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,360
Let me out!

263
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
Qiu Yanzhi!

264
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,400
Ling Ling wants to see you.

265
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,440
- I'll talk to her.
- Yanzhi.

266
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't worry.

267
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
She said she never
wanted to see me again last night.

268
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,280
But now she wants to talk.

269
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
That is a good sign.

270
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,680
I must have a word with Cheng Xi.

271
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
I need confirmation.

272
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,880
Is the letter telling the truth?

273
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,880
You knew it.

274
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,320
That's why you killed Madam Li.

275
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
You knew I am Wang Ruoling,

276
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
the granddaughter of Wang Yang,

277
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,760
the orphan of the Morning Dew Rebellion.

278
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Am I right?

279
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
I'll ask you again.

280
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,240
Did you know?

281
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,120
It's not true.

282
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Cheng Xi is feeding you lies.

283
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,920
So why did you

284
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
kill Madam Li?

285
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
When we train a soldier,

286
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,720
anything that distracts

287
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,880
the mind

288
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,600
should be removed.

289
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,840
The letter is bizarre at best.

290
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,560
It's silly.

291
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
I find it silly as well.

292
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,920
This is why I must

293
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
prove it wrong.

294
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,840
Sorry.

295
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,760
Back off!

296
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,480
Let me out.

297
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Do it, or she dies!

298
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,520
Yu'er, calm down.

299
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,520
Stand down.

300
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,620
(Chess of Generals Camp)

301
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,759
(Prison)

302
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,240
Back off.

303
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Back off, all of you!

304
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,960
Back off, or she dies!

305
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,720
Let her go.

306
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,800
Then I'll let you go.

307
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Let go of her!

308
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,680
She has a heart condition.

309
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,600
If there is so much as a scratch on her,

310
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,600
I'll kill...

311
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,480
Ling Ling.

312
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,080
Calm down.

313
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,480
Cheng Xi lied to you.

314
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
I will confront with her

315
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,280
on my own.

316
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,160
And

317
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,560
stop calling me Ling Ling.

318
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,560
Yanzhi!

319
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,920
Get her!

320
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,960
Don't hurt her!

321
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,360
Are you all right?

322
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,120
Tell me,

323
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,080
where is my aunt?

324
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,760
Yu'er,

325
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,200
it's been a while.

326
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,120
So you've been hiding

327
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,320
in Prince Guang's Residence.

328
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,080
Why can't I live in

329
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
my brother's house?

330
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,960
Right?

331
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,200
You know I hate it when people
beat around the bush.

332
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,720
So is it true?

333
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,640
During the Morning Dew Rebellion,

334
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,080
the Wang family was slaughtered.

335
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
You were the only survivor.

336
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,960
If you want witnesses,

337
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,000
I have none.

338
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
But I do have

339
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,920
the evidence.

340
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,640
What is it?

341
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,480
You were wearing this

342
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
when you were shot.

343
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
After I helped you get changed,

344
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,400
I've been keeping it ever since.

345
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,920
The 8th year of Tai'an,

346
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Chancellor Wang Yang took
his grandchildren to the palace.

347
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,440
Worthy Consort Yang praised
the young Wang Ruoling for her beauty,

348
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,760
and granted her this jade pendant.

349
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,160
There is a record of this
in the Resume Vault.

350
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
Do you recognize it now?

351
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,560
That's right.

352
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,240
This was taken

353
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,080
from your body.

354
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,600
It was Qi Yan's arrow.

355
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,560
If you don't believe me,

356
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,240
you could check the scar on your chest

357
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,080
and also

358
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,600
the tearing on the clothes.

359
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
You were fortunate.

360
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
Your sister shielded you

361
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,400
from a direct hit.

362
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,080
The arrow pierced right through

363
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,960
her body.

364
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,240
That greatly mitigated the
arrow's damage on you.

365
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Hence, you survived the wound

366
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
while your sister is dead.

367
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,840
If that wasn't enough to convince you,

368
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
why not confront Qi Yan

369
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
with this arrowhead?

370
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,160
Back off!

371
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
You spent eight years raising her.

372
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,680
Don't you have any compassion for her?

373
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,040
If I show her compassion,

374
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
where do I get mine?

375
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,560
You are my brother.

376
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Did you

377
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,960
show me compassion
when you crippled me?

378
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,720
Had we not been kins,

379
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,160
I would do more than just crippling you!

380
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,200
Crippling me

381
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,840
is a worse fate.

382
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,440
I spent years mastering martial arts.

383
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,720
My hope was to lead

384
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,560
the Violet Bureau

385
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,440
to protect you
when you become the emperor.

386
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,480
But how did you repay my kindness?

387
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,320
I did everything for you.

388
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,880
I've betrayed Yu'er,

389
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,400
Li Rong,

390
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,560
and Cheng Huaizhi,

391
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,360
but I never betray you.

392
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,080
Sister.

393
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,280
Even if I wanted to be the next emperor,

394
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,280
I would do so righteously

395
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,960
and not as a usurper.

396
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,920
Stealing,

397
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,960
plotting,

398
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,720
robbing

399
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,760
and seizing

400
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,240
are never my intention.

401
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,680
I will never stoop so low.

402
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,840
Besides,

403
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,680
as long as the nation can prosper,

404
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
does it really matter

405
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,120
who has the throne?

406
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320
You are a coward!

407
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
You are as weak as our mother!

408
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,480
She didn't avenge my father,

409
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,120
and she married her enemy!

410
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
Yet the son she gave birth to

411
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,640
speaks of morality

412
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,320
and harms his own sister!

413
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,360
You are a fiend!

414
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,400
A worthless fiend!

415
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Listen closely.

416
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,680
You should take my life now.

417
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
Otherwise,

418
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
I'll make you pay!

419
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Yuan Du.

420
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,000
Yes.

421
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,000
Exile her to the West!

422
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,560
No!

423
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
Take her further away

424
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
to the West.

425
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
Do not stop without my order!

426
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,520
Yes.

427
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Thirteen!

428
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,360
Thirteen!

429
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
How could you do this to me!

430
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,520
You will regret it!

431
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,240
I hope my sister

432
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
hasn't made life difficult for you.

433
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,960
Cheng Ruoyu has learned

434
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,400
her true identity.

435
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm afraid she will never return
to the Violet Bureau.

436
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
From now on,

437
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,480
I will let you be in charge

438
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,320
of the Violet Bureau.

439
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,320
I believe in you.

440
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,800
Where is Cheng Ruoyu?

441
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,320
We couldn't stop her.

442
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,280
Where did she go?

443
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,000
She was heading for Changming Palace.

444
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,600
She is going to Qi Yan.

445
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,240
(Ziyu Pavilion)

446
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,920
I'll be waiting here.

447
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,240
Inform the guards.

448
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,840
When they see Ling Ling,

449
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
do not stop her.

450
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,680
Yes.

451
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
It's been days.

452
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,920
It's time to let you rest in peace.

453
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,560
Do you miss your master

454
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,840
just as I am now?

455
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Well then,

456
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,920
I shall return you to her.

457
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,360
Ready the carriage.

458
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,280
But your heart condition...

459
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll be fine.

460
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I can't let her kill Qi Yan

461
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,679
out of anger.

462
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Nothing we do could salvage
that situation.

463
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
You asked me to come here,

464
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,480
but why?

465
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,160
Is this yours?

466
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,240
Yes.

467
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,200
When was it?

468
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,840
The 9th year of Tai'an.

469
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,440
The Morning Dew Rebellion?

470
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,320
Indeed.

471
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
What about this?

472
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Do you recognize it?

473
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
Do you still remember it?

474
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,880
Where did you get it?

475
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,000
Answer my question.

476
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
Do you recognize this?

477
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,360
Yes.

478
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,040
Wang Yang's little granddaughter

479
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,000
was wearing this before she died.

480
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,520
You remember everything.

481
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,640
What is it that you want to know?

482
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,720
I believe

483
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,800
you were forced to do

484
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,840
those horrible things

485
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,040
during the Morning Dew Rebellion.

486
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,560
I've been serving you for over a year.

487
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,960
I saw you having those nightmares.

488
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,200
I thought

489
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,000
you had your reason to do so.

490
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
You were a kind emperor,

491
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,160
who knows guilt.

492
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,000
That's all that matters.

493
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
But I never knew

494
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
it wasn't enough.

495
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,480
It was far from it.

496
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,600
You would never know the pain

497
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,560
unless you were part of the tragedy.

498
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,760
What is it with you?

499
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,240
What do you want?

500
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,360
I am Wang Yang's granddaughter.

501
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm Wang Ruoling.

502
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,820
(Prince Guang's Residence)

503
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,120
You said

504
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,800
you are Wang Yang's granddaughter,

505
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,440
the very young girl I shot on that day.

506
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,560
So it was you.

507
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,080
It really was you.

508
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,920
No wonder I couldn't find you.

509
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Now,

510
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,920
tell me your reasons.

511
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
Does it matter now?

512
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,040
No.

513
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,680
But perhaps

514
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,080
it might ease the pain a little for me.

515
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,360
Or perhaps

516
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,440
it would give you some closure.

517
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,120
I have nothing to say.

518
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,920
If you came as Cheng Ruoyu,

519
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,960
I would tell you my thoughts.

520
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,120
But you came as Wang Ruoling.

521
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,960
I'll give you your revenge.

522
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,920
How dare you!

523
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,360
Do you not know her?

524
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,800
Sorry, Chess Overseer.

525
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,760
We're following orders.

526
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
No one may pass

527
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,880
without permission.

528
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
Insolence!

529
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,560
Official Qiu is on an isolated meditation,

530
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,640
but how dare you disrespect us!

531
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,880
At first,

532
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,080
I couldn't believe it.

533
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,320
I thought

534
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,960
my aunt had made up

535
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,800
another lie to trick me.

536
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,320
But Yanzhi

537
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,640
named me Ling Ling.

538
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,360
She tried very hard to stop me

539
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,440
from meeting my aunt.

540
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,200
She even killed Madam Li.

541
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,200
After everything,

542
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,760
I couldn't help but think

543
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,080
she might be telling the truth.

544
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,160
And then,

545
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I had some false hope.

546
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,400
I hoped that you had your reason.

547
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,240
Perhaps that very reason

548
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,600
could ease my pain a little.

549
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,840
You are a good person.

550
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,640
Despite what you did

551
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,720
in the past,

552
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,160
I thought you could be forgiven.

553
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,040
Your Majesty,

554
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,840
I came here today

555
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,560
to hear it from you in person.

556
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,400
A sin is a sin.

557
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,400
Whatever reason I had,

558
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm still a sinner.
