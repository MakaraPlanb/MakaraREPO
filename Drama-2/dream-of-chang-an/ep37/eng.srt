14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
(This place is?)

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
(That is me.)

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
(So, His Majesty has hidden
the fake body)

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
(over here.)

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
Come out.

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,280
You followed me all the way here.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
Were you not planning to see me?

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,880
you did recognise me.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,480
Your Majesty, I have not failed my duty.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
I have returned alive.

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,920
Yu'er.

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,160
By the way, Your Majesty,

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,720
how is your injury?

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Your Majesty,

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,560
what's wrong?

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,120
Return to your master and tell him

32
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,160
that if he wants my offspring,

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
he can just drug me.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
There's no need to go through
all of this trouble

35
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
and find a fake Yu'er to dupe me.

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Your Majesty,

37
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm the real Cheng Ruoyu.

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
Your Majesty, I'm the real Yu'er.

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Please put down your sword.

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,480
You are seriously injured.

41
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,840
You mustn't lose your temper.

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,040
Don't you recognise

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
my voice?

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,200
Look.

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
I am the real Cheng Ruoyu.

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
And, you knew what happened

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,600
within the Chess of Generals Camp.

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,440
The story that you have made up
is indistinguishable from the truth.

49
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
(We have found a girl)

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
(with looks identical to Cheng Ruoyu.)

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
(She is good at sophistry.)

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,040
(We have ordered her)

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,080
(to learn the martial arts
of Violet Bureau.)

54
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,400
(Her name will be Ling Ling.)

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,600
(She will follow us on our expedition.)

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
(She will return to the Capital under
the pretence of capturing the emperor.)

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,080
(We will make our plans
accordingly after that.)

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
What are these?

59
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,600
These are the secret letters

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
that I have intercepted from
the Chess of Generals Camp.

61
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
You fooled the emperor to cross the sea,

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
and you came back to life. Great job.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
Your Majesty, that isn't the case.

64
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,640
You must trust me.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
You want me to trust you?

66
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Seeing you as you rise from the dead,

67
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,000
it makes me sympathise more with myself.

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,000
You will give birth to my offspring

69
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
so that Qiu Ziliang will be able

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
to control the next emperor,

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
am I right?

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,200
Your Majesty,

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
are you doing this
out of bitter reasons?

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,840
Who do you think you are?

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,400
How dare you pretend to be my Yu'er?

76
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Scram.

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Scram!

79
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,200
(Yu'er,)

80
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
(I'm sorry.)

81
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
(Please don't blame me for this.)

82
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,920
You're back.

83
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,640
Have you met Qi Yan?

84
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,000
It's no wonder you're letting me
meet His Majesty.

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
Why are you angry with me?

86
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,840
Qi Yan was the one who didn't want to
acknowledge your existence.

87
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
You should be angry with him.

88
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
It's all because

89
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,120
you spread false information
with the secret letters.

90
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
If not, he wouldn't fall for it.

91
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,640
Do you think I wouldn't fall for
the tricks of others?

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,640
No matter what people say about you,

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
you're the only one whom I trust.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
I'm sure she hates you to the core.

95
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,720
She hates me?

96
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,400
It's better than her struggling

97
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,720
to sever her ties from Qi Yan.

98
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Do you not plan

99
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,800
to tell her the truth?

100
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,840
I don't know what to do either.

101
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
Your Majesty.

102
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Your Majesty,

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
it's time for you to take your medicine.

104
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,280
(Seeing you as you rise from the dead,)

105
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
(it makes me sympathise more
with myself.)

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,720
(You will give birth to my offspring)

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,400
(so that Qiu Ziliang will be able)

108
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
(to control the next emperor,)

109
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
(am I right?)

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,720
(Return to your master and tell him)

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,840
(that if he wants my offspring,)

112
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,760
(he can just drug me.)

113
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,360
(There's no need to go through
all of this trouble)

114
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
(and find a fake Yu'er to dupe me.)

115
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,400
(Now that I think about it,)

116
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,520
(it's normal for His Majesty)

117
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,480
(not to acknowledge my existence.)

118
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,360
(With the secret letters)

119
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
(and the fake body,)

120
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,480
(he wouldn't trust my words
that easily.)

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,400
(Who do you think you are?)

122
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
(How dare you pretend to be my Yu'er?)

123
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,280
(Scram!)

124
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,600
My Yu'er?

125
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm sure

126
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240
it's because His Majesty
cares too much about Yu'er.

127
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
That's why he's not acknowledging
Ling Ling's existence.

128
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,200
(Yes.)

129
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,560
(I'm sure that's the case.)

130
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,200
(I mustn't be frustrated
because of this.)

131
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,920
(I mustn't fall for
Qiu Ziliang's tricks.)

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,120
(Cheng Ruoyu,)

133
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
(let's give this another try.)

134
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,200
(I'm sure His Majesty will
recognise me sooner or later.)

135
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,840
Have you straightened out your thinking?

136
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
What do you mean?

137
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
It's getting late.

138
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
You should sleep in my room.

139
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
Chess Overseer,

140
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
the room is ready.

141
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Both of you may leave.

142
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Understood.

143
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
What are you trying to do?

144
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you going to place me
under house arrest?

145
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,600
You are overthinking it.

146
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,360
If so,

147
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
why aren't I getting my own room?

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't want to sleep
in the same room as you.

149
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Staying in my room is more convenient.

150
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,480
No one will spy on you in here.

151
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
I have plenty of things
I want to teach you.

152
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
You're planning to teach me?

153
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,400
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting,

154
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Astronomy and Geography,

155
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams,

156
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,120
mystic skills,

157
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,720
I will teach you everything.

158
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Have you solved it?

159
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,440
What kind of nonsense is this?

160
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
This is too difficult for me!

161
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,120
If so, how did you manage to understand

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,040
the Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Formation
in one go back then?

163
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,880
You actually knew about that?

164
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,400
I know everything

165
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
that has happened in your life.

166
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
Qiu Yanzhi,

167
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
seems like you had spent

168
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,520
a huge amount of effort
to take me under your wing.

169
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
It's good that you know that.

170
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
The palace's celebration banquet

171
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
will be starting soon.

172
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Wait.

173
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
I thought you promised me

174
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,120
that I can put an end

175
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
to my relationship with His Majesty?

176
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,080
You had met His Majesty yesterday.

177
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
You should give me another chance.

178
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,040
Yesterday's meeting was too hasty.

179
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,280
That doesn't count.

180
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
I haven't given up on him yet.

181
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
You do say everything
that is on your mind

182
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,280
without thinking it through.

183
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,680
Fine.

184
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,920
I'm not a heartless person.

185
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
If you can solve this formation,

186
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,920
I will allow you to go.

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,840
Your Majesty,

188
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,560
the banquet is ready.

189
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
We await your presence.

190
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,240
Did Ling Ling attend the banquet?

191
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't think so.

192
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
All right.

193
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,760
I want to go out

194
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,480
and take a breather.

195
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,000
I swear

196
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
that I won't escape.

197
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm serious.

198
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm here to see Prince Guang

199
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,920
under Chess Overseer's order.

200
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,359
I have important matters
to discuss with him.

201
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,440
Prince Guang.

202
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,200
Yu'er?

203
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
Please save me.

204
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,960
Official Zhang, please.

205
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm done.

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Did you fall asleep?

207
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Did you solve the formation?

208
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,720
So, this is how you solve the formation.

209
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Your Highness, you're amazing indeed.

210
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,720
You're very knowledgeable

211
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
when it comes to traps and formations.

212
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,320
This formation is exceptional.

213
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Where did you get this from?

214
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,080
Yanzhi showed me this formation
in order to test me.

215
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,520
She's teaching you this

216
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
for your own good.

217
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
I think she just wants to
make things difficult for me.

218
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,160
She's doing it deliberately so that
I won't be able

219
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
to enter the palace and see His Majesty.

220
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,360
Enter the palace?

221
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
I don't know

222
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,240
if I can make it in time.

223
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Farewell.

224
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,160
Thank you, Prince Guang.

225
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Yu'er.

226
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
I've committed a bad deed

227
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,520
even though I was well-intentioned.

228
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,560
I solved the formation.

229
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,640
You better keep your words.

230
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Farewell.

231
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,400
Prince Guang.

232
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,120
Did I ruin your plan?

233
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,040
Were you referring to the formation?

234
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,800
I didn't know that she was going to
see His Majesty

235
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
after solving the formation.

236
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
It's fine.

237
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,800
No one was able to stop her anyway.

238
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
Ever since

239
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
you taught her the
Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Steps,

240
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
ordinary soldiers

241
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,480
have no way to catch up with her.

242
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
Yu'er does have innate talent

243
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,800
for learning martial arts.

244
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
How does she fare
compared with Qiu Ziliang?

245
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
Yu'er is broad-minded.

246
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
If she can focus on
improving her martial arts

247
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,080
and be well-acquainted
with the ways of the world,

248
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,120
she will be able

249
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,360
to surpass Qiu Ziliang.

250
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Are you sure?

251
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
I am.

252
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Since ancient times,
good always triumphs over evil.

253
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,200
Your Highness,

254
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,800
thank you.

255
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
You will never be able to imagine

256
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,200
how important it is for me

257
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,920
to learn

258
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,360
that Ruoling is still alive.

259
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
And you, who told me about this fact,

260
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
are very important to me as well.

261
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,200
How do you plan

262
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,360
to make them cut their ties?

263
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
As long as His Majesty
doesn't acknowledge her existence,

264
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,360
their ties will be cut eventually.

265
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
But, will His Majesty

266
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
be able to do so?

267
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
Eunuch Cheng.

268
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,800
Sorry for being late.

269
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,520
Who are you?

270
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,800
Are you Yu'er?

271
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
I thought you were dead?

272
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,000
Eunuch Cheng,

273
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,120
I am Ling Ling.

274
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,200
I was late because
I had something to attend to.

275
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,680
Can you bring me in?

276
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,560
You resemble her too much.

277
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
The resemblance is uncanny.

278
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Uncle,

279
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I am Yu'er.

280
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,320
I am the real Yu'er.

281
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,920
I didn't die.

282
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,480
Qiu Ziliang ordered his men to kill me,

283
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,040
but Yanzhi saved me.

284
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
This is a secret.

285
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
Now, only you and His Majesty
know this secret.

286
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
But, His Majesty doesn't want
to acknowledge my existence.

287
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
Can you help me out?

288
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,480
I wish to help you,

289
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
but,

290
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,960
I don't dare to trust you.

291
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,360
Uncle, if you don't trust me,

292
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
you may ask me questions.

293
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,480
Ask me something that
only I have the answers to.

294
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
What is your favourite food?

295
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,480
Cherry pastry.

296
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,320
What is my favourite food?

297
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Jujube rice cake.

298
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
What is Xi's favourite food?

299
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,640
Roasted camel hump.

300
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,960
What is Li Rong's favourite food?

301
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
Li Rong?

302
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,720
For Madam Li,

303
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
she likes nothing in particular.

304
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
But she doesn't eat fish.

305
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,960
Not even one bite.

306
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
Yu'er!

307
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Uncle.

308
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,240
Cheng Huaizhi.

309
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,480
Your Majesty.

310
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Your Majesty.

311
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,600
Uncle,

312
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
please tell His Majesty about it.

313
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,440
Your Majesty,

314
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
this is Yu'er.

315
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Your Majesty, she's still alive.

316
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,160
Your Majesty.

317
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,000
She isn't Yu'er.

318
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
Yu'er is dead.

319
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Your Majesty.

320
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
I am right in front of you.

321
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,920
My body,

322
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,720
my voice,

323
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,760
my hands, my feet,

324
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,800
my entire being, and my heart,
all of them are here.

325
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Why are you

326
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,640
ignoring me?

327
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,280
Even if you are similar

328
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,600
to Yu'er in every way,

329
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
you are not Yu'er.

330
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,360
I

331
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
won't fall for your trick.

332
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Your Majesty.

333
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
Your Majesty!

334
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Are you not acknowledging my existence

335
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
because you're worried about something?

336
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,560
Maybe...

337
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,080
Maybe you're doing so

338
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,000
because you're afraid

339
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
that Qiu Ziliang may try to harm me

340
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,920
once he knows that I'm still alive.

341
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,360
If that isn't the case,

342
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
that means it's Yanzhi.

343
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,800
Is Yanzhi using me as an excuse
to threaten you?

344
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,240
Your Majesty,

345
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,960
if you have any arrangements for me,

346
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
please tell me.

347
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
I will follow your instruction.

348
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,480
But, please don't do this to me.

349
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,840
I feel upset

350
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,880
when you're not acknowledging
my existence.

351
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,640
You're indeed a warrior of sacrifice

352
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

353
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Not only do you bear an uncanny
resemblance to her,

354
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
you know how to manipulate
the human heart as well.

355
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,840
I almost fell for your trick.

356
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,360
Do you know why I'm sure

357
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,880
that you are not Yu'er?

358
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,560
Why?

359
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Why?

360
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,320
Why?

361
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,880
How did you hurt yourself?

362
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,960
I saw it.

363
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Saw what?

364
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
I saw you washing
Prince Guang's sleeves for him.

365
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
You even...

366
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Is that why

367
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,240
you got yourself into a fight?

368
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
Remove your clothes then.

369
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
I can wash them for you as well.

370
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,240
That's not what I want.

371
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,520
What do you want then?

372
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,120
I...

373
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
You're supposed to marry Qi Yan

374
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,840
and become the empress.

375
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,640
Yes.

376
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,600
Did you change your mind?

377
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,400
I didn't.

378
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,000
You did.

379
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,560
Your determination

380
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,600
is starting to waver.

381
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,920
What I wished for

382
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
and hoped for

383
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,280
hasn't changed at all.

384
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm sorry.

385
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,360
I shouldn't have forced you.

386
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
But, I am jealous.

387
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
Although you're going to marry Qi Yan,

388
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,880
I know you did so

389
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
out of revenge.

390
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,800
But, when I see Prince Guang,

391
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,000
I feel afraid.

392
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,920
You changed after you knew

393
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
that he was the one

394
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
who had saved your younger sister.

395
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Ru Feng!

396
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
Ru Feng!

397
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,680
Ru Feng!

398
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,320
Did you see that?

399
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Ru Feng is running away.

400
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,800
Yesterday,

401
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,280
you came to me

402
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
and told me that you were Cheng Ruoyu.

403
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,920
But, when Ru Feng saw you,

404
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,360
it didn't respond.

405
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,920
Is that reason good enough for you?

406
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,480
Your Majesty.

407
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,640
Your Majesty!

408
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,480
What do you want me to do

409
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,000
in order to make you trust me?

410
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,400
Why aren't you acknowledging
my existence?

411
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,120
Your Majesty.

412
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Ru Feng, good boy.

413
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,160
You do listen to me indeed.

414
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
Bring it to the stables.

415
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
Your Majesty,

416
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,040
I think she is Yu'er.

417
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
Huaizhi,

418
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
your niece,

419
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,120
Cheng Ruoyu, is dead.

420
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Her body

421
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
is within Ziyu Pavilion.

422
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

423
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
(Ru Feng couldn't recognise me.)

424
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
(Uncle couldn't recognise me.)

425
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,000
(His Majesty couldn't
recognise me as well.)

426
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,120
(So,)

427
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,640
(it's difficult)

428
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,800
(for me to prove that I'm still alive.)

429
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,600
(How long will I be able to live?)

430
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,280
(Your Majesty,)

431
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,400
(you have around five years.)

432
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,040
(All right.)

433
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,520
(I will live every day to the fullest
for the next five years.)

434
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
(But,)

435
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,440
(Your Majesty, you need to be prepared.)

436
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,560
(Your Majesty, you might die within five
months if the condition becomes worse.)

437
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,440
You are still young.

438
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,240
And I,

439
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,440
won't be able to live for long.

440
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,480
Instead of

441
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
letting you take the risk

442
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,880
and return to my side,

443
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,840
I would rather

444
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
let you stay with Yanzhi.

445
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
At least you will be safe.

446
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,680
(After tonight's departure,)

447
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
(I'm afraid there would be no way)

448
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,440
(for me to return
to this place anymore.)

449
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,600
(Farewell,)

450
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,200
(Changming Palace.)

451
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,080
(Farewell,)

452
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,080
(Your Majesty.)

453
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,440
Yu'er,

454
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,560
you just need to stay alive.

455
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,120
Even if I were to die,

456
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,360
everything will be fine,

457
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,760
as long as you're alive.

458
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm here to bring you back.

459
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,720
Let's return home.

460
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,960
Home?

461
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,640
I don't have a home.

462
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,640
The Chess of Generals Camp
isn't my home.

463
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,920
Where else can you go

464
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,200
if you don't follow me back?

465
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,760
You must be proud of yourself right now.

466
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
His Majesty fell for your trick.

467
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,720
He wasn't willing to acknowledge
my existence,

468
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,600
and I have no other choice.

469
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
I can only follow you back.

470
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,280
Congratulations.

471
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,720
You have finally embraced reality.

472
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
Since you have embraced reality,

473
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,560
you still have plenty of things
to learn.

474
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,920
You have no time to throw a fit.

475
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,760
And,

476
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,440
you do have a home.

477
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,240
From now on,

478
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,480
the places I go

479
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,280
will be your home.

480
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Understand them,

481
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,080
and study them thoroughly.

482
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,960
Come.

483
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,920
It's hot!

484
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Don't move.

485
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,840
It's good for your injury.

486
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,680
Do you even know what you are doing?

487
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,520
It hurts over here as well.

488
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Higher.

489
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
I don't believe it.

490
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm sure I'll win tomorrow.

491
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,880
What kind of lousy sword
did you give me?

492
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,120
It's unusable.

493
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,120
Do you want to retrieve
your Qingguang Sword?

494
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,200
Forget about it.

495
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,680
Just let that sword

496
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,880
accompany the dead Cheng Ruoyu.

497
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,760
You are giving up already?

498
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,520
I thought

499
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,840
you would continue to see Qi Yan.

500
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,680
until he acknowledges your existence.

501
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,560
Actually,

502
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,040
I think His Majesty does trust my words.

503
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,400
He doesn't want to acknowledge
my existence

504
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,440
for my own good.

505
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,320
Before this,

506
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,920
I didn't think it through.

507
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,600
I went to find him on a whim.

508
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,920
But, now that I think about it,

509
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,960
I did realise that
it was dangerous of me to do so.

510
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,720
If Qiu Ziliang wasn't on a retreat,

511
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,680
he would've known that
I was still alive.

512
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,600
So,

513
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,360
no matter how terrible

514
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,080
your advice may sound before,

515
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,840
I am still grateful to you.

516
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,840
And, for the past few days,

517
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,440
I can feel that you were

518
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,080
trying your best to teach me.

519
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,640
When I was in the Violet Bureau,

520
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,440
Aunt didn't teach me
anything in particular.

521
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
I was ignorant.

522
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,560
Until the day...

523
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
Until the incident with Yuzhen Hall.

524
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,280
Only then, you started to
realise your folly,

525
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,360
am I right?

526
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,360
You are right.

527
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,840
And now,

528
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,440
although it may seem like
you are forcing me to learn,

529
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,280
actually, I am enjoying myself.

530
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,560
I

531
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,800
have a question for you.

532
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,560
Tell me.

533
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,840
Why are you treating me this well?

534
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Cheng Xi is missing.

535
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,640
Two months ago,

536
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Zhang Jiang sent his men

537
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,880
to kill the guards around her.

538
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,080
He brought her away.

539
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
Now, Zhang Jiang has lost his battle.

540
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,280
We have no idea about
her current whereabouts.

541
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,000
Ask Madam Jade to lead the search.

542
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,360
Qiu Ziliang

543
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,400
finally fell for our trick
and went on a retreat.

544
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,000
We mustn't let new problems crop up

545
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,160
during a crucial moment like this.

546
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,640
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,760
And,

548
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,200
keep an eye on Li Rong.

549
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,720
If her elder sister returns here,

550
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,080
she will definitely contact her.

551
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,760
Yes, Your Highness.

552
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,920
I had a younger sister in the past.

553
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,280
She was intelligent and mischievous.

554
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,160
Unfortunately, she passed away.

555
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,360
You resemble her.

556
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,280
Whenever I look at you,

557
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,760
I feel as if I was looking at her.

558
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,680
But, I'm teaching you all these skills

559
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,680
for the sake of the Violet Bureau.

560
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,160
What do you mean?

561
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,880
Violet Bureau's
Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Formation

562
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,240
can rival 1,000 men

563
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,600
with just 100 men.

564
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,440
If we can use it within a real battle,

565
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,960
it will be highly effective.

566
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,720
Now,

567
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,240
Cheng Xi is gone.

568
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,760
Don't you want to return to the bureau

569
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,840
and lead them to glory again?

570
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,600
Last time, you were able
to solve the formation

571
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,680
because of Prince Guang's help.

572
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,320
You grabbed hold of your opportunity.

573
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,680
Now,

574
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
I'm helping you to catch up
with traps and formations

575
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,120
so that you can integrate them
into your strategies.

576
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,160
Only then, the Violet Bureau
will be able

577
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,120
to perform at its best.

578
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,160
If you want to protect Qi Yan,

579
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,600
if you want to deal with Qiu Ziliang,

580
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
if you want to be
the second Madam Gongsun,

581
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,320
the first thing you must do

582
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,960
is to make yourself stronger.
