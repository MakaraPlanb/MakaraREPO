14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,120
That was so scary.

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,560
I can't believe I dreamed

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,760
that I died

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,280
and was even buried with His Majesty.

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,080
May luck be with me.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Is it this one?

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,680
All right?

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,880
I'll go inside myself.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
Stand guard outside.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,320
Are you Yanzhi's confidant,

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Ling Ling?

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,680
Why are you wearing a mask?

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
My face got burned when I was little,

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,320
so I look very ugly.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,920
I've always worn a mask.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,160
She didn't tell me

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,440
about this.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,040
Can you fight?

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Of course.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
Mobilizing and organizing the troops,

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
including the long travel,

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
will take a month.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
You have one month

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,600
to recover from your injury.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,720
No problem.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
You...

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,280
What?

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
Your voice

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
sounds a bit familiar.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,600
Of course.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,160
No wonder

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,200
everyone says

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
that I have a nice voice.

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,400
Sir.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Sir.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,760
You can't wait any longer.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,880
You must train in isolation at once

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
in order to maximize

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
the pill's effect.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Otherwise,

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,360
it will backlash on your heart meridian.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,680
Are you all right?

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Go, all of you.

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
I told you many times already.

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm going into isolation training!

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Go!

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,040
At this point...

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Sir.

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
It's not the right time
to go into isolation training!

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,120
- Right, sir.
- Right, sir.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480
You can't go
into isolation training now, sir.

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,000
- Sir.
- Sir.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,800
How is it not right?

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,880
The divine healer guaranteed

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,720
that His Majesty's feeble condition

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,640
would last at least a few months.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Besides, Prince Guang

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,840
is under my surveillance.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,320
The Shencai Army
is also suppressed already.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
What's inappropriate about this?

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,720
However,

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
what should we do with Li Deyun?

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,600
- Right.
- Right.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
- What should we do with Li Deyun?
- What should we do with Li Deyun?

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,120
For Lucong's rebellion,

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
let those civil officials
handle that first.

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,200
Remember this.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,840
The emperor is the key.

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
As long as we have

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,560
the emperor in our hands,

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,920
no matter what Li Deyun does,

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,960
it would be useless.

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,600
Then...

87
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,800
Cheng Xi hasn't been captured yet.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
What should we do if she returns

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,480
and make trouble?

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
- Right, sir.
- What should we do?

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,440
The Chess of Generals Camp
has already taken precautions.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
What if they can't guard against her?

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,640
Also,

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,160
a batch of military pay and provisions

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
might have been dispatched temporarily,

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,680
but we don't know where to get more

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
for the next few months.

98
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,200
What if

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
they start a riot, sir?

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
- Right, sir.
- What should we do?

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
This matter

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,920
hasn't been resolved yet.

103
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
What should we do?

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Sir, come up with a plan.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,880
We don't know what to do anymore.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,200
- Sir.
- Sir.

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
What should you do?

108
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,720
Why do you have so many concerns?

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,640
I don't know what to do either!

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
I told you already.

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm going into isolation training!

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Can't you understand that?

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
What do I need you all for?

114
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,400
Scram!

115
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
Get lost!

116
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Go!

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,760
Leave!

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,600
What a useless bunch!

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Sir, don't be angry.

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,440
As long as you take the pills
according to the secret manual,

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,640
it can surely make you live long

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
and energetic.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
These things won't be a problem.

124
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Official Qiu is suddenly gathering

125
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,120
all the Golden Chess Pieces.

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
I don't know what it's about.

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
All the Golden Chess Pieces?

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,120
Yes.

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,080
(Chess of Generals Camp)
Then Right Minister...

130
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,534
(Chess of Generals Camp)

131
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,440
If he's here,

132
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
what will happen on Prince Guang's side?

133
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,920
He's a substitute.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
Substitute?

135
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,360
They look quite alike.

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,560
Where did he find him?

137
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
Since Chess of Generals Camp
was established eight years ago,

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,960
this is the most complete we've been.

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,560
Rise.

140
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,960
Yanzhi.

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
Come here.

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
After I go into isolation training,

143
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,960
let Chess of Generals Camp
do two things.

144
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
First.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Continue searching for Cheng Xi.

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,920
Second.

147
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,800
Watch Prince Guang closely.

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,160
Yes.

149
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Right Chariot.

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
Is Left Chariot back?

151
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,000
Not yet.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
When he's back,

153
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
guard me with him.

154
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
Yes.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Left and Right Ministers.

156
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Yanzhi is still young.

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,280
You must assist her.

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Don't worry, sir.

159
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,720
Then

160
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,120
you're all dismissed.

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

162
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,040
What are you thinking about?

163
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,600
Is it Left Chariot?

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,840
Official Qiu sent him to kill Misha.

165
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
He succeeded, but still hasn't returned.

166
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Something's fishy.

167
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,200
That's right.

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
However,

169
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
that's not what I'm thinking about now.

170
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,200
What is it then?

171
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,680
I'm thinking

172
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
that Qiu Ziliang might not be able

173
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
to get out of isolation
training anymore.

174
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,440
What do you mean?

175
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
First.

176
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
Qiu Ziliang's secret manual
for martial arts training

177
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
was from Thirteen's master.

178
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
And Thirteen's Prince Guang.

179
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
Will Prince Guang be that nice

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
and really give him a secret manual
for unbeatable martial arts?

181
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,560
You mean

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,680
this is a trick?

183
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,160
If Prince Guang can use eight years

184
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,280
to establish himself in the Chess
of Generals Camp,

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,960
he can also place a book here.

186
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,840
Otherwise,

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,120
which secret manual

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,760
will let people take pills long-term

189
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,960
and it will backlash on you
if you don't go into isolation training?

190
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,680
Second.

191
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Right Chariot works for Prince Guang.

192
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
The divine healer he recommended
to Qiu Ziliang

193
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
naturally works for him too.

194
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,240
One is guarding him, one is performing
needle treatment for him.

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,160
Even if he's not sick,

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
he'll become sick.

197
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,280
Also,

198
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
the timing is too coincidental.

199
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
There are internal issues
and external enemies.

200
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Letting him go into isolation training

201
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
in such a crucial time

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,440
is too beneficial

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
for Qi Yan,

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,360
Li Deyun,

205
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,080
and myself.

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,920
So

207
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,280
Prince Guang intentionally arranged
all of these things?

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,800
He's such a terrifying person.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,680
Yes.

210
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
He's very clever in his schemes.

211
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,280
He's scary indeed.

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
You and I should celebrate.

213
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
After all these years,

214
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560
Qiu Ziliang is finally

215
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
going to die.

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,000
It's too early to celebrate now.

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,640
I personally revised

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
the latter half of the secret manual.

219
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,640
If he takes the pill according to it,

220
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
his condition will surely deteriorate.

221
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,480
I don't believe

222
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,040
that Qiu Ziliang

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
can still reverse his situation!

224
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,080
Your Highness.

225
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm back.

226
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,880
Is she all right?

227
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
I've already sent her back to Tibet.

228
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
Twenty local ladies

229
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,960
are taking care of her.

230
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,960
Don't worry.

231
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,640
After this matter is over,

232
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
I'll personally bring her back.

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
No matter what happens,

234
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
she'll still my sister.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,680
Thank you.

236
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,240
Go and rest.

237
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,920
Yes.

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,360
Prince Guang.

239
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,120
Let me ask you something.

240
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
You really don't want the throne back?

241
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,480
No.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,640
No?

243
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,000
I suggest

244
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,400
you think about it carefully.

245
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,440
Because His Majesty

246
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
really won't live long.

247
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,480
(The war in Lucong
is making the citizens suffer.)

248
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:29,550
(End it as soon as you can.)

249
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:30,768
(You can ask someone to ambush
Lucong's military camp first,)

250
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,676
(then personally lead
the troops there afterwards.)

251
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,120
Your Majesty.

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
This is the thing you want.

253
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,360
Are you still going to Ziyu Pavilion,
Your Majesty?

254
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,698
(End it as soon as you can.)

255
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
Your Majesty, don't worry.

256
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,800
I

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
will go to Grand Empress Dowager

258
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,760
and tell Handmaiden Xiu
to give this to Miss Li.

259
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,800
I'll get going.

260
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Yu'er.

261
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,560
I knew this isn't you.

262
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm feeling better these days.

263
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
After Qiu Ziliang went
into isolation training,

264
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,160
his people are watching me less closely.

265
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,880
You must be in Lucong now

266
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,880
and quelling the rebellion for me.

267
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,560
I

268
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
came to guard you.

269
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,320
Since

270
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,360
you became the Sword Bearer,

271
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
you've suffered a lot.

272
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,920
At first,

273
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,040
I complained about you.

274
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
Then I doubted you.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,040
I even pushed you away many times.

276
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,200
I

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,200
am really sorry.

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
These are for you.

279
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,440
Consider these as compensation.

280
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
Eat the pastry,

281
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
and I'll eat the cold noodles.

282
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,720
Cold pagoda noodles.

283
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,360
Yesterday,

284
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,440
you ate your favorite.

285
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Today,

286
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,920
try my favorite.

287
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Does it hurt?

288
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Do you regret it?

289
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,880
Are you happy?

290
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
Yes.

291
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
Does it hurt?

292
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,440
Do you regret it?

293
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
Are you happy?

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,280
Yes.

295
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:24,743
(Map)

296
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:30,579
(Map)

297
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,680
What happened?

298
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,960
Where is Ling Ling now?

299
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,360
Qi Yan made Zhang Zhongru

300
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,160
the Acting Military Commissioner.

301
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,040
Little...

302
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Ling Ling is also there with him.

303
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
How is her injury?

304
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Did someone give her a hard time?

305
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,480
She's doing well.

306
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,640
She's recovering quickly.

307
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,800
No one dares to give her a hard time.

308
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Furthermore,

309
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
in lending our troops this time,

310
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,160
she contributed a lot
to how things have gone smoothly.

311
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,320
I heard that Zhang Zhongru
really recognizes her talent

312
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
and wants her to be his goddaughter.

313
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,520
My sister

314
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
is outstanding, of course.

315
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,920
The likes of Zhang Zhongru

316
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
don't deserve to be her godfather.

317
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,000
Over 5 km of Lucong has been invaded.

318
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,920
Does Li Deyun have a plan?

319
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,080
Yes,

320
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,280
but Li Deyun didn't come up with it.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
It was Qi Yan.

322
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,720
- General.
- General.

323
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,280
(Lucong's Acting Military Commissioner
Zhang Zhongru)

324
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,240
Ling Ling.

325
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,240
Come.

326
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
Take a look at this.

327
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
(This is His Majesty's handwriting.)

328
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,120
Now,

329
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,080
the Lucong army is standing guard
outside the city.

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,360
I've already dug a tunnel

331
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,200
and sent an assistant general to check.

332
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,760
It goes straight
under Zhang Jiang's tent.

333
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Now, I need someone to lead

334
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,440
a team of elite warriors

335
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,840
and capture Zhang Jiang

336
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,560
without anyone knowing.

337
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,280
Based on my observation,

338
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,320
you're the most agile one.

339
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,280
What do you think?

340
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,520
Do you dare to go?

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
Yes.

342
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,640
Good.

343
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Conserve your energy.

344
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,200
Depart at 11 pm tonight.

345
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,280
Yes.

346
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,840
In an instant,

347
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,000
I've already left the palace
for three months.

348
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,360
I wonder

349
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
how His Majesty is doing.

350
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,000
General.

351
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,560
We're ready to leave.

352
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,960
Take care.

353
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,240
Go.

354
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:01,134
(Chess of Generals Camp)

355
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
For tonight's battle,

356
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
even if I've already sent people
to protect her secretly,

357
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,040
one can easily get hurt
by knives and swords.

358
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,760
Ruoling.

359
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
You must be safe.

360
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,360
Since you're so worried,

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,680
why did you let her go and fight?

362
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
She has already decided
to quell the rebellion.

363
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,400
How can I stop her?

364
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,280
Forcing her to stay by my side

365
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
will only cause trouble.

366
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,640
I should just

367
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
let her leave for a period of time.

368
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,520
Besides,

369
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,560
even if I've already become a demon,

370
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,200
I don't want people to suffer.

371
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
It's time

372
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
to end this rebellion.

373
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Convey my orders.

374
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,640
Conserve your energy tonight.

375
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,520
We'll attack the city tomorrow.

376
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,480
- Yes!
- Yes!

377
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
Reporting!

378
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,000
General.

379
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,880
She's here.

380
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,680
(Lucong Army Commander, Zhang Jiang)

381
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,200
All right.

382
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,160
(Lucong Army Commander, Zhang Jiang)
Hurry, let her in.

383
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,800
Yes.

384
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,880
You're here.

385
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Thank you, General,

386
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,880
for bringing me back from Tibet.

387
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,680
No worries.

388
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,800
(Aunt.)

389
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,040
You ended up that way

390
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
because you wanted to help me.

391
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
Besides, if I want to succeed in this,

392
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll still need your guidance.

393
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm willing to assist you.

394
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,480
Come, have a seat.

395
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,320
Let's sit and chat.

396
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,720
Well,

397
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,120
we should talk about

398
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
the posthumous edict.

399
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,680
Do you really have Emperor Wenzong's
posthumous edict?

400
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,960
No.

401
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,880
You...

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
You dare to lie to me?

403
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Back then, the late emperor wrote
the posthumous edict

404
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
and gave it to Chancellor Wang Yang.

405
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,560
But Wang Yang was killed,

406
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,280
and we don't know
where the posthumous is.

407
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
In the past eight years,

408
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,440
Qiu Ziliang never found it.

409
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,080
What does that prove?

410
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,800
What?

411
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,960
If someone isn't
intentionally hiding it,

412
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,320
it was accidentally destroyed.

413
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
But when you wrote the letter
and asked for my help,

414
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,640
you said

415
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
that you're going to give me
the late emperor's posthumous edict

416
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,840
in exchange for your protection!

417
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,800
Yes, or no?

418
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,320
General Zhang, don't be angry.

419
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,640
Even if I don't have the real
posthumous edict,

420
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,080
I can fabricate one that seems real.

421
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,720
What do you mean?

422
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
Since no one

423
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,320
has seen the real posthumous edict,

424
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,480
we can make a fake one.

425
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Isn't mobilizing troops in the name

426
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
of obeying the late emperor's will
and restoring legitimacy

427
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,960
a more justified cause?

428
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
After we conquer Heng'an

429
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
and kill Prince Guang,

430
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,280
Xing will be yours.

431
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
What if someone brings out

432
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,800
the real posthumous edict?

433
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,160
Just don't admit to anything,

434
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,960
and find an opportunity to take it.

435
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
Amazing.

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,320
(I can't believe that Aunt is colluding
with the enemy)

437
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,520
(and siding with Zhang Jiang.)

438
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,800
The commander for this battle

439
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,520
is Zhang Zhongru.

440
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,440
What do you think of him?

441
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,600
He's very good at military affairs,

442
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,480
and he's familiar
with military strategies.

443
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
What is your advice then?

444
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,640
(I can't miss this opportunity.)

445
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
There's an assassin!

446
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,960
Did Yanzhi send you here?

447
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,080
Bring him to General.

448
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,960
Where are you going?

449
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm going to find someone.

450
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,640
Let's go.

451
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,360
Zhang Jiang is useless.

452
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,760
He was captured so easily.

453
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,280
I originally wanted to use him

454
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
to return to Heng'an.

455
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,000
Forget it.

456
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,360
I can only think of another way.

457
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,920
Who was that assassin earlier?

458
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
Why does her fighting style
look so familiar?

459
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,040
As they say, you dream

460
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,840
of what you're thinking about.

461
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Why can't I dream of you?

462
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,160
Yu'er.

463
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,160
Are you all right?

464
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,280
Yu'er.

465
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,880
I

466
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,040
have to go to sleep.

467
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,480
General.

468
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
Our army's ambush was a huge success.

469
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,920
After Ling Ling captured
Zhang Jiang alive,

470
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,200
he tried to escape along the way,

471
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,080
and assistant officer cut off his head.

472
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,240
This is Zhang Jiang?

473
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,120
Yes.

474
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
Great!

475
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,640
Thank you for all your hard work.

476
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
Rest properly tonight.

477
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll report this to His Majesty

478
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
and ask for a reward.

479
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, General.

480
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,920
You may go.

481
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,480
Ling Ling.

482
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,000
You've made such a great accomplishment.

483
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Why do you look so down?

484
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
No.

485
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Some people managed to escape,

486
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,840
so I...

487
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,600
That's fine.

488
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,600
The leader of Lucong's rebellion

489
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,720
has already been beheaded.

490
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,680
His followers who escaped can't do much.

491
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,560
You

492
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
should sleep well tonight.

493
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Return to the capital with me tomorrow.

494
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,320
I can go too?

495
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Of course.

496
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,240
You're the major contributor

497
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,000
to this ambush plan.

498
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,560
I must bring you along
to see His Majesty.

499
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes.

500
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,720
Thank you, General.

501
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,720
Go.

502
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
This is great.

503
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,400
I can finally return to the palace
and see His Majesty.

504
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,000
However,

505
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,120
I haven't captured Aunt yet.

506
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,240
And I don't know where she went.

507
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,040
I would like to ask you to help me
look for someone.

508
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,640
Bring her to me once you find her.

509
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,120
Her name is Cheng Xi.

510
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,840
Yes.

511
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:07,484
(Zhang Jiang tried to escape,
so we cut off his head.)

512
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,518
(Battle Report)

513
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,760
Zhang Zhongru is good.

514
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,200
He's a talent indeed.

515
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,840
Zhang Zhongru achieved such a victory

516
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,360
because he's good at leading troops

517
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,280
and he relied on your arrangements.

518
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,320
I didn't expect

519
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,560
that not only are you good
in riding horses and archery,

520
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,160
you're even knowledgeable
in military strategies.

521
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,720
This battle went so smoothly

522
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,800
all because Zhang Jiang
wasn't strong enough.

523
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,440
He deserved to be captured alive.

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,160
If it was Qiu...

525
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,960
Regardless,

526
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,400
that person is capable indeed

527
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
for capturing the leader

528
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,400
among the thousands of troops.

529
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,880
What is her name?

530
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,600
Her name is Ling Ling.

531
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,840
She

532
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
works for Qiu Yanzhi.

533
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,680
Your Majesty.

534
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Regarding this person,

535
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,840
you must take a look

536
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,520
at this.

537
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,880
What is this?

538
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
While marching the troops,

539
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Zhang Zhongru unintentionally sabotaged

540
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
a spy from Chess of Generals Camp.

541
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,000
We found these there.

542
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:14,393
(Notes)

543
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:19,925
(Notes)

544
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:30,035
(Notes)

545
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,960
Left Chariot came back last night.

546
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,160
Greetings, Chess Overseer.

547
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
How is Father?

548
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,480
He's still in isolation training.

549
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
In coming here today,

550
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
do you have an important matter
to report?

551
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,800
It's not really important.

552
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,400
Since it's not convenient for Father,

553
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,600
I won't disturb him.

554
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,520
Left Chariot.

555
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,560
Your leg...

556
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,800
I encountered danger
while working outside.

557
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,600
My leg is broken.

558
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,440
(Chess of Generals Camp, Left Chariot)
I arrived late.

559
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,719
Please forgive me.

560
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,320
She looks like Princess Misha indeed.

561
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,639
You've personally checked it.

562
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,679
Are you still suspicious?

563
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,960
I keep feeling

564
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,199
that Left Chariot is acting strange.

565
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,199
Also,

566
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,520
I can't accept

567
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,760
losing such an important pawn

568
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
like Misha.

569
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,280
Don't be annoyed anymore.

570
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,240
I'll tell you a piece of good news.

571
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,440
Ling Ling is back?

572
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,720
She hasn't entered the city yet.

573
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,880
Come.

574
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,280
Why are you here?

575
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,400
I feel like I haven't seen you
for a long time.

576
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,360
I especially came to congratulate you

577
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,360
after hearing of your victorious return.

578
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,880
You don't need to do this, Master.

579
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,280
I'll do it myself.

580
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,960
Master?

581
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,040
Since I'm your confidant,

582
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,480
of course I must call you Master.

583
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,760
I don't see

584
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,200
your willingness to do so.

585
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,120
You know what?

586
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,200
Sincerity must be exchanged
with sincerity.

587
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,440
What you're doing to me

588
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,120
is coercion and bribery.

589
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,800
Of course there won't be any willingness
on my part.

590
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Someday,

591
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,160
you'll become willing.

592
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,440
How's your injury?

593
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,240
Let me check.

594
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm not injured.

595
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
Who told you that I'm injured?

596
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,720
By the way,

597
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,080
I have something to tell you.

598
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,600
In the list of people

599
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,640
entering the palace tomorrow,

600
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,720
my name is included.

601
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,920
Ling Ling is included,

602
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
not Cheng Ruoyu.

603
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,920
Have you forgotten?

604
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,600
Cheng Ruoyu is already dead.

605
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Qi Yan is alive.

606
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,440
He's doing well.

607
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
Isn't that enough?

608
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,760
No.

609
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,440
I want to personally see him
before I can feel at ease.

610
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Yanzhi.

611
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,600
I'm back in the capital now.

612
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
I'll surely see His Majesty.

613
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,880
You can stop me once or twice.

614
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
But can you stop me forever?

615
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Fine.

616
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
It's good for you to have closure
with him as well.

617
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,240
After seeing Qi Yan tomorrow,

618
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,840
return to Chess of Generals Camp.

619
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,840
I'll wait for you.

620
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
I have a question for you.

621
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,840
Why did you name me Ling Ling?

622
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,600
Does this name

623
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,040
have a special meaning?

624
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,920
It's hard to comment on the corruption
and decline of people.

625
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,120
There's a huge difference
between their reputations.

626
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,280
The honest are abandoned,

627
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
and corrupt ones
are increasingly favored.

628
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,720
I hope you'll always remember that.

629
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,040
The honest are...

630
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
I don't understand.

631
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,360
What does that mean?

632
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,280
The army is victorioius.

633
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,480
Why are you unhappy, Your Majesty?

634
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,440
Someone wants to provoke me.

635
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,160
How can I feel happy?

636
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Huaizhi.

637
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Yes.

638
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,800
If someone tells you

639
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,440
that Yu'er is alive,

640
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,880
will you believe it?

641
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,520
Really, Your Majesty?

642
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,120
Yu'er is alive?

643
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,120
Yu'er.

644
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,120
This is great.

645
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,080
Your Majesty.

646
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,880
Where is Yu'er now?

647
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,160
Look.

648
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,320
You're very happy indeed.

649
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,920
Even if there's only a gleam of hope,

650
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,000
you're willing to believe
that she's still alive.

651
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,320
Your Majesty.

652
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm slow.

653
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,560
I don't know what you mean.

654
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,320
Chess of Generals Camp

655
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,960
found a woman

656
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,280
who looks like Yu'er.

657
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,640
They'll let her say
that she's Cheng Ruoyu

658
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,600
and return to my side.

659
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,560
Your Majesty.

660
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,840
What is their objective in doing so?

661
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Since Qiu Ziliang

662
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,240
doesn't want me to continue living,

663
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
how can he support Prince Guang
to ascend to the throne?

664
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
That's why

665
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,000
he's waiting.

666
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
He's waiting for me to have a son.

667
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,400
Your Majesty, all these years,

668
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,480
the only woman you've been close with

669
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,600
is Yu'er.

670
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
Then they want...

671
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,720
They want

672
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,120
to create a fake Yu'er

673
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,160
to give birth to a royal son.

674
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,720
I can finally see His Majesty.

675
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,160
We heard news

676
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,800
that something went wrong
in Official Qiu's isolation training.

677
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
His life is in danger.

678
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,480
Is the news reliable?

679
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,440
How is it going?

680
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,320
Summon Acting Military Commissioner
Zhang Zhongru!

681
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

682
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,960
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

683
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
Rise.

684
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,200
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

685
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,800
In Lucong's battle,

686
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,840
you've all worked hard.

687
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Huaizhi.

688
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,880
Yes.

689
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,920
Read the imperial edict.

690
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,760
Yes.

691
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,560
"In the Chancellery,

692
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,560
Acting Military Commissioner
Zhang Zhongru

693
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,560
led 800 elite warriors

694
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,720
and 500 knights

695
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,280
in quelling Lucong's rebellion

696
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,600
and killing the traitorous general.

697
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,560
Since he accomplished merits
in ending the rebellion,

698
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,240
he'll become Lucong's
military commissioner

699
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,120
and perform his duties accordingly.

700
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,720
He'll also be Minister
of Proofreading Works,

701
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,520
Youzhou Chief Military
Commissions Administrator,

702
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,600
and Censor-in-chief.

703
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,600
He's given the title of Prince Lanling.

704
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,280
The rest of the troops

705
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,000
will be awarded accordingly.

706
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,000
In addition, everyone will be given
ten decaliters of grains

707
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,520
and ten pieces of cloth.

708
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,880
That's the imperial command."

709
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,800
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

710
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,440
Tomorrow,

711
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,800
we'll hold a banquet in the palace

712
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,440
to celebrate your victory.

713
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm a bit tired today.

714
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,640
You're dismissed.

715
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,960
Take care, Your Majesty.

716
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,360
You're dismissed!

717
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,520
Ling Ling.

718
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,840
For His Majesty's banquet tomorrow,

719
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,200
you must attend.

720
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,760
Yes.

721
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,280
Let's go.

722
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,440
That's strange.

723
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,120
His Majesty's not returning
to his chambers.

724
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,680
Where is he going?

725
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,800
You may all go.

726
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,280
