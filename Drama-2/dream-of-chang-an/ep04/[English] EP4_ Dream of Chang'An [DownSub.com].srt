(I'm sure that Cheng Ruoyu)

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,360
(is disappointed in me too.)

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,220
(Royal Repository)

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,040
You are here, Little Fish.

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,000
How is it?

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,920
Did you find anything?

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,800
(Liu Juan)

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
We are too late.

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
What do you mean?

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,960
It means that

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,720
someone has cleaned up this place.

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,640
(Royal Repository)

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,760
Every book that is related

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,880
has been tampered with.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,840
And he left no trace.

30
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,350
(Guan Wu)

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,600
(Ren Cuilan)

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
Did you notice anything?

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
The ink inside

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Zheng Wu's book

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
is different from others.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,120
Resumes are often written in ink
from She Prefecture.

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
But it was sealed off by snow
on the 9th year of Tai'an.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,640
We didn't get any ink
from them for two years.

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,280
So, the secretaries

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
had to use ink from Heng'an.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
These two inks

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
are almost identical
in colours and shine.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,640
The only difference is the smell.

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
This Resume of Zheng Wu
is written in the ink

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,280
from She Prefecture?

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
On the 10th year of Tai'an,

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
when you entered the palace,

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
this ink shouldn't have existed.

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,080
Is this the only one

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
with different ink?

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Yours too.

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Mine?

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,590
(Cheng Ruoyu)

54
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,450
(Guan Wu)

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,040
You found this?

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,960
Not me.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
It's Qiu Yanzhi.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
When I went to the Royal Repository
to investigate,

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,640
she was there too.

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
Why are you smiling?

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
Did you already know that

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
our Resumes

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,080
have been tampered with?

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
They are not tampered with.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
These two books

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
are written afterwards.

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Every six months,

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
Resumes will be put under the sun
to get rid of bookworms

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
and they'll be restored.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,519
One time,

71
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,560
yours and Zheng Wu's book

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
were on top of each other.

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,960
And they were soaked in tea.

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
So, the secretaries

75
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,040
made another copy of them.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
There's a record of this incident.

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Didn't you see it?

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,600
No.

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
So, it means that

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
there's nothing wrong with my Resume.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Of course.

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Not only yours,

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
but there's also nothing wrong
with Guan Wu's Resume too.

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,400
The problem started

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
before she entered the palace.

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Not after.

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
Okay then.

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Yu'er.

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
Don't get too close to Qiu Yanzhi.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't worry.

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,560
I have my boundaries.

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
Looks like they've found out about it.

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,320
Luckily,

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,760
we have a fail-safe.

95
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,960
In order not to make it obvious that

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
Yu'er's Resume is different,

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,200
we soaked the one below hers too.

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
And that happened to be Guan Wu's Resumes.

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
This is really fate.

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
As long as they don't investigate Yu'er,

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
everything will be fine.

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
I'm not worried about Yu'er.

103
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm worried about Qiu Yanzhi.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,080
A girl brought up by a cunning person

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
is indeed hard to deal with.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,170
(On the first day of lunar January,
10th year of Tai'an...)

107
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,400
On the first day of lunar January
in the 10th year of Tai'an,

108
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
Emperor Wen rebuilt the Violet Bureau.

109
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,720
He chose 1000 people

110
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,960
and gave them 1000 bolts of silk

111
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,200
and 1000 koku of corns.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,120
There were 1000 people?

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,160
But the Violet Bureau now

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
has only 36 maids.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,640
Even if we include
the musicians and performers,

116
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,520
it'll just add up to 100.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Where are the rest?

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
They said that others were

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,320
asked to leave

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
after failing certain tests.

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,120
But according to the spies

122
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
I sent out to investigate,

123
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,640
a lot of them didn't go home.

124
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
They went missing?

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,560
This is the record of

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
His Majesty's hunting expenses
in recent years.

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
What do you see?

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm having a headache
just by looking at it.

129
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Just tell me the conclusion.

130
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
It's getting more and more costly.

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Last year,

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,720
His Majesty spent as much as
the Chess of Generals Camp.

133
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,600
It means that

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
His Majesty's hunting expenses
for a year

135
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,200
can afford another
Chess of Generals Camp.

136
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,920
Cheng Xi used to serve the late emperor.

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,800
And the late emperor and His Majesty

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,800
are enemies.

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,760
His Majesty shouldn't have
spared Cheng Xi.

140
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
But not only he did that,

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
he trusted the Cheng siblings

142
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,520
with the Violet Bureau.

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,840
Why?

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
He wants to use the Violet Bureau

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
against the Chess of Generals Camp.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
How can he do that?

147
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,840
With

148
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,160
those 36 maids?

149
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,200
So,

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,600
you suspect that

151
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,280
the girls who were sent away

152
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
are actually

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
being brought up by Qi Yan?

154
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,720
And the money comes from
his hunting trips?

155
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
I can't think of

156
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
another possibility except this.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
I think

158
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
it's time for you to go back

159
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,480
and play chess with Sir.

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
I'm planning to do that.

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,750
(Duke Chu's Residence)

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
You want to...

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
When I travelled with Qi Yan,

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
we ran into two assassination attempts.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,400
And they were more like a provocation.

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,320
If we add your birthday banquet,

167
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
it'll be the third time.

168
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
What do you suspect?

169
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,960
The Violet Bureau

170
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
has been building forces in secret.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
Someone found out about it

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
and wanted to use this chance
to make us fight.

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,320
So,

174
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,960
they sent a maid from Violet Bureau

175
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,080
to assassinate you

176
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,640
and frame it on Qi Yan.

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Who is it?

178
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,360
I don't know that yet.

179
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,200
But since they purposely exposed

180
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,960
the secrets of Violet Bureau to us,

181
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm sure they've planned out something.

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
I want to use Guan Wu's case

183
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
as a bait to uncover

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,320
this person's identity.

185
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,800
Your Majesty.

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
I have the answer.

187
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,040
Yu'er.

188
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Get back.

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Where's Yanzhi?

190
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
What answer do you have?

191
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Yanzhi said that

192
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
when Zheng Wu and I entered the palace,

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,280
the ink in our Resumes

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
is different from others.

195
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,800
She suspects that
they have been tampered.

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
I've checked this

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,880
with Aunt.

198
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,040
They were damaged due to an accident.

199
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
Not forged.

200
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,200
What else?

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
What else?

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
Nothing else.

203
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,600
Let me ask you.

204
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,240
Why are you here?

205
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
Are you going to continue

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,960
investigating this together
with Qiu Yanzhi?

207
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
I want to continue
with this investigation.

208
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,120
But I don't plan to

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
join hands with Qiu Yanzhi.

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,480
I already said,

211
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
this case is closed.

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,920
It's not.

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,960
(Royal Repository)

214
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
What did you say?

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,080
I said,

216
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
this case is not closed.

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,360
Your Majesty,

218
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,920
Zheng Wu's revenge

219
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
is just the start.

220
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
During the Morning Dew Rebellion,

221
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,800
almost 1000 officials had been killed.

222
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,720
We had countless casualties.

223
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
Why won't you let me investigate?

224
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
What are you afraid of?

225
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,840
If I can't even find out

226
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,640
the identity of our enemies

227
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
and their purpose,

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,760
how can I protect you

229
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,800
with my sword?

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
For your safety

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
and to prevent the next assassination,

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
this is my duty

233
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
as the Sword Bearer.

234
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,120
I have to do this.

235
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,360
Yu'er!

236
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,480
Okay.

237
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
I'll tell you this then.

238
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
You are no longer the Sword Bearer.

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,800
Wait.

240
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,520
Cheng Huaizhi.

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
Pass down my decree.

243
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,840
Cheng Ruoyu will be removed from
her position as the Sword Bearer

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
and she's now just a commoner.

245
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
She'll leave the palace

246
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,240
and never come back.

247
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,720
Leave now.

249
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,120
Do you think I want this?

250
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,680
Yu'er.

251
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,440
Yu'er.

252
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,440
Wait.

253
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,680
The matron is still trying to help you.

254
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,280
This is not final.

255
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,360
Madam Li.

256
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
I've made up my mind.

257
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,040
No need to persuade me.

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
But where can you go

259
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
if you leave?

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,880
What about us?

261
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
Can you really abandon us?

262
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm sorry that

263
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
I didn't live up to your expectation.

264
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,720
Before you became the Sword Bearer,

265
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,520
I was worried about you.

266
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,640
After you became the Sword Bearer,

267
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
I was even more anxious.

268
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,280
Now that you are not a Sword Bearer,

269
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm still worried about you.

270
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,800
Aunt.

271
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,280
I've never wanted to

273
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,160
become a Sword Bearer.

274
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,720
I just want to be by your side.

275
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
Actually, this is not bad.

276
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
I've been kicked out from the palace.

277
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,120
But,

278
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,240
with my capabilities,

279
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,640
I can come back anytime.

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,240
So,

281
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,880
nothing will change.

282
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,240
Everything will be the same.

283
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,480
You.

284
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Forget it.

285
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
This is...

286
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
I didn't give you this because
I didn't want you to get into trouble.

287
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,000
But if I don't give it to you now,

288
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
how can you protect yourself
outside of the palace?

289
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,680
You are the best.

290
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
After you leave the palace,

291
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
stay in Cai's Wine Store for the moment.

292
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,200
The owner is Li Rong's sister-in-law.

293
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
She'll take good care of you.

294
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,800
Then, I can eat biángbiáng noodles

295
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,440
every day.

296
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,680
Aunt.

297
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
I have another request.

298
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,680
I want to

299
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
continue investigating Wu's case.

300
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,280
We are like sisters.

301
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
Her death is too unnatural.

302
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,640
I feel bad about it.

303
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,800
Aunt.

304
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,840
Let me investigate.

305
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,720
Or else, I can't sleep.

306
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
I always dream about her

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,640
crying to me.

308
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,960
Okay.

309
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,560
Is that a yes?

310
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
How can I reject you

311
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,520
when you said that?

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,640
Go.

313
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,520
Thank you.

314
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Before this, you said that

315
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,440
this case has to be investigated from
the outside of the palace.

316
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,600
It's good that I'm fired.

317
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
It's easier for me

318
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
to investigate from
the outside of the palace.

319
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,080
Aunt.

320
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,640
Now,

321
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm no longer the Sword Barrier.

322
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,560
Please return this

323
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,000
Qingguang Sword

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
to His Majesty.

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
Since His Majesty
didn't take back this sword,

326
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm sure he has his reasons.

327
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,920
Keep it for now.

328
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,960
Okay.

329
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,560
(When a man is meant for greatness,)

330
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,960
(his mind will be tested,)

331
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,720
(his body will be put to labour,)

332
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
(he will face hunger,)

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,320
(he'll be emptied out)

334
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,320
(and he has to face
countless obstacles.)

335
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
(So, this challenge)

336
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,280
(will be beneficial for me.)

337
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,760
I don't need any help.

338
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,720
I don't need anyone to be understanding.

339
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,960
And I trust no one.

340
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,880
So,

341
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
leave.

342
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,620
(West Fair)

343
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:07,470
(Cai's Wine Store)

344
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Mrs. Cai.

345
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm here.

346
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,280
Yu'er.

347
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,040
Come.

348
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,800
Be careful.

349
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,320
Are you surprised?

350
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,960
Are you shocked?

351
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,480
I miss you so much.

352
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,800
Come, Aunt.

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,560
- Let's go.
- Let's talk inside.

354
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,960
Sir.

355
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,320
(Chess of Generals Camp)

356
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,760
Sir.

357
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
Cheng Ruoyu has been kicked out
from the palace.

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,040
(Chess of Generals Camp)

359
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,280
Looks like his pawn

360
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,760
is no longer under your control.

361
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,600
Yes.

362
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
Based on my deduction,

363
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,840
Qi Yan is the one who ordered
the Violet Bureau

364
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,640
to keep his power in secret.

365
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,800
If that's the case,

366
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,560
he shouldn't have kicked out
Cheng Ruoyu.

367
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,160
Based on your deduction,

368
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,160
why did Qi Yan

369
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,360
end Zheng Wu's case in a rush?

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,960
To prevent us

371
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,000
from gathering more clues

372
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,040
through Zheng Wu's admission
to the palace

373
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
and find out the magnitude

374
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
of the Violet Bureau.

375
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,440
Am I wrong?

376
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
No matter it's true or not,

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
we need the evidence.

378
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,880
When you are playing chess,

379
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
you'll change

380
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
and your opponent will change.

381
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,480
What do you mean?

382
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
You think that

383
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,200
you are baiting him.

384
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
But he wants to

385
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,520
use you as his pawn too.

386
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,370
(Chess of Generals Camp)

387
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,270
(Zheng Residence)

388
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,480
This is Zheng Wu's previous home.

389
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll start from here.

390
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,600
(Memorial tablet of Zhengs)

391
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,850
(Memorial tablet of Zhengs)

392
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Who are you?

393
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,480
Who are you?

394
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,680
How do you recognise Qingguang Sword?

395
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Qingguang Sword is just

396
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,480
a useless piece of metal in your hands.

397
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,120
Where is she?

398
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,800
We saw her coming in just now.

399
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,680
Let's go.

400
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,840
Don't move.

401
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,160
There's really no one here.

402
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

403
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,800
Your swordsmanship is not that good.

404
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,520
But your reaction time is not bad.

405
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
If you are on the battlefield,

406
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
your inexperience

407
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,280
will kill you.

408
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,200
What did you say?

409
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
My swordsmanship is bad?

410
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,200
Since young,

411
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
nobody dared to say that to me.

412
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,200
Don't act tough.

413
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,680
You should win me first.

414
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you saying that

415
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
we'll meet again?

416
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,520
No.

417
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,680
Someone like you

418
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,560
will die soon.

419
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,720
You don't know that.

420
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,920
Do you want to make a bet?

421
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
Let's bet

422
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,320
if I can stay alive to meet you again.

423
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,400
And the next time we meet,

424
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,880
I'll defeat you.

425
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,680
Your Majesty.

426
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,720
Time to wake up.

427
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
You are so clumsy.

428
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,120
Get up.

429
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,400
I can't believe you.

430
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,640
Come, Your Majesty.

431
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,120
Okay.

432
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,240
Huaizhi.

433
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
What is your niece doing?

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,840
She went to Cai's Wine Store

435
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,800
to sell wine.

436
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,840
Is she really selling wine?

437
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,480
Why do you ask?

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
The sash of Violet Bureau.

439
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,560
Cheng Ruoyu's sash.

440
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,400
How can you tell?

441
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
Cheng Ruoyu wields the Qingguang Sword.

442
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,920
Her sash has silver threads in it.

443
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,960
Why will her sash

444
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,080
appear

445
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,120
on His Majesty's boot?

446
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Looks like

447
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,360
the person she saw
in Zheng Residence last night

448
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,720
is His Majesty.

449
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,820
(Cai's Wine Store)

450
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,160
Mrs. Cai.

451
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
You are going out?

452
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,120
Yu'er.

453
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm going out for grocery shopping.

454
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Take care of the shop for me.

455
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,160
Don't worry.

456
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,880
Be careful.

457
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,800
Okay.

458
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
(The whole Zheng family
was punished to death.)

459
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,760
(How did Zheng Wu escape?)

460
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
(Who gave her a false identity)

461
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,000
(and sent her into the palace?)

462
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,080
(She has been lying low for so many years.)

463
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,080
(Why did she suddenly
try to assassinate)

464
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
(His Majesty?)

465
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
(With her martial art skills,)

466
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,360
(she knew that she wouldn't succeed.)

467
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,560
(Why did she choose
to sacrifice herself?)

468
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,120
Yes.

469
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,240
Why did she do that?

470
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,720
Another thing.

471
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,160
Who is

472
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,920
the man in black?

473
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,960
Could he be the person

474
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,480
who saved Wu

475
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
back then?

476
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm having a headache again.

477
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,440
You followed me home?

478
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,800
Stop right there!

479
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,120
Your Majesty.

480
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,920
Why are you running?

481
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,600
I...

482
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,320
What are you doing?

483
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,560
Let go of me.

484
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,280
Why are you here at west fair again?

485
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,480
I know.

486
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
You are an emperor

487
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,600
who doesn't need to
attend the imperial court meeting.

488
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm here to eat biángbiáng noodles.

489
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,160
Where is Mrs. Cai?

490
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
What a pity.

491
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,880
She went out for grocery shopping.

492
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,400
Goodbye.

493
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Bring me some wine.

494
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
Why are you so shocked?

495
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,200
This is a wine store.

496
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Don't tell me that there's no wine.

497
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,680
The palace has all kinds of great wine.

498
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,200
Why are you drinking here

499
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,360
instead of your palace?

500
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,560
Are you deaf?

501
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
What's so hard about
getting me some wine?

502
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,800
Go now.

503
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,560
He came here alone to drink

504
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,240
without his guards.

505
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,800
Here you go.

506
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,320
Thank you.

507
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
But I don't drink.

508
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,280
I'm not asking you to drink.

509
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm asking you to try.

510
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm no longer

511
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,240
your Sword Bearer.

512
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,640
Why do I have to test the wine for you?

513
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,160
Since you are my customer

514
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
and I'm the seller,

515
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll do that for you then.

516
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,320
This has been watered down.

517
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,000
No.

518
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll inform the authorities

519
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,400
to close down this shop.

520
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Your Majesty.

521
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,280
Those two jars of wine
are just some mistakes.

522
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,200
Rainwater must have gotten in

523
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,880
when it rained

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
a few days ago.

525
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,200
Actually, it's not true.

526
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I was just being naughty

527
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
by adding water into the wine.

528
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,880
Those are for me.

529
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,040
Cheng Ruoyu.

530
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,400
Are you sure you want to commit treason?

531
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,320
Your Majesty.

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,560
Just tell me what you want.

533
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,000
No need to beat around the bush.

534
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,680
You've kicked me out from the palace.

535
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
Are you going to

536
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
kick me out from Heng'an City too?

537
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,200
Yes.

538
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,120
Why?

539
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,000
You know why.

540
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,120
You go against my decree.

541
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,840
By kicking you out

542
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,640
instead of killing you,

543
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,520
it's already

544
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,920
the biggest mercy from me.

545
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,000
Should I thank you for your mercy then?

546
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,560
But,

547
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,440
I think you better kill me.

548
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
Or else,

549
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
I'll continue to investigate

550
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Wu's case.

551
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
Cheng Ruoyu.

552
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,520
Do you really think that

553
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,360
I won't kill you?

554
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
Unfortunately, I'm not afraid of death.

555
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
I couldn't save my friend
when she was suffering.

556
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,640
I couldn't uphold justice for my friend
when she was wrongly accused.

557
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,440
I couldn't stop you
when I knew that you were being cruel.

558
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,920
These

559
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
are scarier than death.

560
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,360
Good.

561
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,600
Very well.

562
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
With you being so weak,

563
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,760
I'm going to

564
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
teach you a lesson today.

565
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
We received an urgent report.

566
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,040
His Majesty

567
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,120
went to Cai's Wine Store in the east

568
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,400
to visit Cheng Ruoyu.

569
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,800
And he's attacked by assassins again.

570
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,280
We'll know soon whether or not

571
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
Qi Yan has changed.

572
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,800
(Cai's Wine Store)

573
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm no longer the Sword Bearer.

574
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't have to protect him, right?

575
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,640
An evil emperor like his

576
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
should just die.

577
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,560
He even wanted to cripple me just now.

578
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,280
But,

579
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,560
what if he gets hurt?

580
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,840
Forget it.

581
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,600
Tell me.

582
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,520
Who are you?

583
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,040
Why did you try to assassinate
His Majesty?

584
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,240
You can kill me.

585
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Shut up!

586
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,920
You can still talk.

587
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,960
Don't worry.

588
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
I won't kill you.

589
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
I'll give you some wine.

590
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,360
Tell me!

591
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,960
Cheng Ruoyu.

592
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
You know me?

593
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,200
Sir.

594
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,200
All six assassins

595
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,440
are killed by hidden weapons.

596
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,480
No one is alive.

597
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,720
What about those who fired
the hidden weapons?

598
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,560
We couldn't see.

599
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,400
And we can't find them.

600
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,440
What?

601
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,680
It's the same as the assassination
in the wine store last time.

602
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
They leave no trace.

603
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,320
We can't track them at all.

604
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,160
How is that possible?

605
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
You couldn't see who fired

606
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,160
the hidden weapons?

607
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
When you play chess,

608
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,680
unexpected moves are the worst.

609
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,800
Those moves are unexpected

610
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,280
because of your own uselessness.

611
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,280
Checkmate.

612
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,520
Your Majesty.

613
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,800
Chase after them.

614
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,560
Why did you stop?

615
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,880
Cheng Ruoyu.

616
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,560
You are skillful, right?

617
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
I lost them.

618
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,239
Come down.

619
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,560
No.

620
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,159
You better come down.

621
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,239
Just now, you said that

622
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:21,760
you are going to cripple me.

623
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I won't go down.

624
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,480
Stop investigating, okay?

625
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,239
No.

626
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,400
Let's talk properly.

627
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,440
Let's talk properly.

628
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
Don't fight.

629
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,600
Since you protected me,

630
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
I'll forgive you.

631
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,280
Really?

632
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,400
Your Majesty, where are you going?

633
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,600
What should I do with these bodies?

634
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,280
Report them.

635
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

636
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,880
All six bodies are inside.

637
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,720
You are a noble woman.

638
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,960
How about

639
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
I ask the coroner

640
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,920
to give you a report?

641
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,240
Silver needle used in acupuncture.

642
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,160
Based on my observation,

643
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
it's the same hidden weapon
used by Zheng Wu.

644
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,400
But,

645
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,120
this needle is coated in poison.

646
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,120
It's good that it's coated in poison.

647
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
There aren't many poisons that kill

648
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,560
on contact.

649
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,400
We'll be able to identify it.

650
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,880
Find out about it.

651
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,960
It's you,

652
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,440
right?

653
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,360
I'm no longer

654
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,040
your Sword Bearer.

655
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,640
Why do I have to test the wine for you?

656
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,680
Since you are my customer

657
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,880
and I'm the seller,

658
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,520
I'll do that for you then.

659
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
If I can't even find out

660
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,560
the identity of our enemies

661
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,760
and their purpose,

662
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
how can I protect you

663
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
with my sword?

664
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,600
For your safety

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,920
and to prevent the next assassination,

666
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,360
this is my duty as the Sword Bearer.

667
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,920
I have to do this.

668
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,600
Looks like

669
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,280
she really knows nothing about

670
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,400
the Violet Bureau.

671
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,960
If I let her stay in the capital,

672
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,680
she'll ruin the plan.

673
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
I have to think of a way

674
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,680
to chase her out.

675
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:51,170
(Prefecture Court)

676
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,080
Officer.

677
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,160
Don't close the door.

678
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,480
Officer.

679
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
How did the investigation go?

680
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,560
You said that

681
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,480
you'd give me an answer soon.

682
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,760
It has been three days.

683
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
Have you found the assassins?

684
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,800
Even if we have,

685
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,360
we'll report it to the court.

686
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,040
It's none of your business.

687
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,160
Leave.

688
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,680
You are wasting my time.

689
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,440
(Prefecture Court)

690
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,840
This homicide case happened in my shop.

691
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,840
Why can't I ask about it?

692
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,160
They are useless.

693
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,560
They are as crooked as their superior,

694
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,160
that useless emperor...

695
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
This is not right.

696
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,120
Why did His Majesty...

697
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,880
What are you doing?

698
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
Visit the wine store?

699
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,520
- This is Prefecture Court.
- Could it be that

700
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,200
he really went there

701
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,560
to eat biángbiáng noodles?

702
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,880
Stop this!

703
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
Don't make a scene
in front of the court.

704
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,800
Stand back!

705
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Leave.

706
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,240
Your Majesty.

707
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,560
He's here.

708
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
Your Majesty.

709
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,920
Prince An

710
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,160
has been taken away by Duke Chu.

711
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,950
(Library of Historical Records)

712
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,040
Too many people have died in front of me

714
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,040
in the past two days.

715
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,160
So,

716
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,320
you better

717
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
save yourself.

718
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,760
Your Majesty.

719
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,840
Qiu Ziliang has detained Prince An.

720
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,760
He wants to...

721
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,920
He's giving me a warning.

722
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
If I don't do as he says,

723
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,680
he'll dethrone me.

724
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,880
What should we do then?

725
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
What should we do?

726
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,560
How about you ask your sister?

727
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,880
Madam Cheng.

728
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,240
Ask her to come out with a solution.

729
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,640
You still refuse to say anything?

730
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
Is it not working because

731
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,760
they have been watered down?

732
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,440
Continue to drink.

733
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,840
Continue to drink.

734
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,920
Let me ask you.

735
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,880
How many fingers am I holding up?

736
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,760
One.

737
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,720
This one?

738
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,560
One.

739
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,280
What about this one?

740
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,760
One.

741
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,920
One.

742
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,520
Okay.

743
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,480
You are almost there.

744
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,400
Okay.

745
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,520
