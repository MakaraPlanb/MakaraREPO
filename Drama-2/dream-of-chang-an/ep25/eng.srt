14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Your Majesty,

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
for the past few years,

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,000
Aunt

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
has set up several strongholds
within Heng'an City.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,080
And, Your Majesty,

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,440
you know where the strongholds
are located.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,640
Therefore,

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
it's impossible for her to hide Misha

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
within those strongholds.

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
But,

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,120
she feels insecure when
she leaves her at somewhere else.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,320
Therefore,

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
the riskiest place

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
will be the safest place.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,320
So, she is...

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,760
So, you suspect

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
that Misha is hidden within
the Violet Bureau.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,720
If you want to store water,

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
the best way

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
is for you to pour water into the well.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
The best way

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,800
for her

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
to hide Misha

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,520
is to put her together

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
with a group of girls.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
That way, no one will find her.

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
tonight, around 11 pm,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
Uncle will try to keep Aunt at bay.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,720
We will head to the Violet Bureau

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,040
and see if Misha is over there.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,080
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
I understand.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
You were disappointed in me

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
because

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
I didn't tell you the truth about Aunt

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,480
before this.

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,720
I won't refute your argument.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,760
What I can do now

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
is to save Misha.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
I'll let time

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,160
prove everything for me.

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
So, what if

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,320
Cheng Xi appears

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
when we try to save Misha?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
What if she tries to stop us?

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll hold her off,

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,040
using my sword,

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
my body,

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
and my life.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,000
Madam Jade,

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
it's me.

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm here to find Misha.

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
Do you know where she is?

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
Aunt is committing
a grave mistake right now.

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
I need to save the situation

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
before it's too late.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Although you're a warrior of sacrifice

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
and you need to follow her instruction,

73
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,880
Yuzhen Hall

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
is under my rule now.

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,399
And I

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,320
need your help.

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
Liu Misha isn't here.

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
Ziyuan?

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
Yanzhi did release you indeed.

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,360
I don't need her to release me.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
I can escape by myself.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,520
Stop pretending to be my benefactor.

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Yes.

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
You did save me.

85
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
You are my benefactor.

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,560
Please help me ask Madam Jade

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,840
regarding the whereabouts of Misha.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,040
She doesn't know it either.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
Cheng Xi didn't bring Misha

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
back to the Violet Bureau.

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,400
At least, she has never
seen her here before.

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
That shouldn't be.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Aunt should've

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,880
hidden Misha in the most obvious place.

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
I told you before

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,760
that Cheng Xi wasn't a decent person.

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
Now, you and Qi Yan

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
have witnessed it for yourself.

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,880
Your Majesty!

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,000
Aunt, stop!

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,000
He is our emperor!

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
How dare you not kneel before me?

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
We already fought with each other.

104
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,360
Do you still want us to pretend
as if nothing had happened?

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
I originally thought

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,960
that there were three loyal subjects

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,440
I could put my trust in.

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,960
Huaizhi,

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,960
Han Ding,

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
and you.

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
Do you trust me?

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,120
You aren't someone
who will serve the rich and powerful,

113
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
not to mention

114
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
submitting yourself

115
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,560
to the rule of someone like Qiu Ziliang.

116
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,920
Reason.

117
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Give me a reason why you betrayed me.

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,760
There is no reason.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
I just despise you.

120
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Do you despise me?

121
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,720
Yes.

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,400
You are not worthy enough
to be the emperor.

123
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,240
You are unambitious, incompetent,
reckless, and imprudent.

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600
You're unable to embrace your duty
to get rid of the eunuch's faction

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,120
and restore the Xing empire.

126
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
That's why you should give up.

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,480
You should let a more capable person
become the emperor.

128
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,600
Cheng Xi!

129
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,880
Cheng Xi!

130
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
You don't know your place at all.

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Have you ever thought about it?

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,960
The words that you've uttered just now

133
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
are heinous enough

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,480
that your family and clan
will be massacred because of it!

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Your Majesty!

136
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
So, you despise me?

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
Tell me then.

138
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,880
Who is the person

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,760
who is worthy enough to be the emperor?

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,960
My younger brother.

141
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
Nonsense!

142
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
Your Majesty, don't listen to her!

143
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
She only has me as her elder brother.

144
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
She doesn't have a younger brother.

145
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,800
Qi Yan,

146
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
do you know who I am?

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Who are you?

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
According to our ranks in the family,

149
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,280
you should address me as your aunt.

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,360
Both of us are descendants of

151
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,600
the Emperor of Jing, Qi Hu.

152
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,920
The old woman of the Qi Family

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
was 70 years old.

154
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,080
She once gave alms

155
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,880
to Cheng Huaizhi,
who just came to the Capital.

156
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,200
Yes.

157
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,720
Cheng Huaizhi is grateful to her.

158
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,920
That's why he always
offers her financial aid.

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,440
The old woman confessed to us

160
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
that Cheng Huaizhi

161
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,800
brought a lady with him

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,600
when he asked the old woman
to take them in.

163
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
I showed her the portrait of Cheng Xi.

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,400
She was the lady he brought with him.

165
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
So,

166
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,560
Cheng Huaizhi was alone

167
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
when he escaped from Puzhou.

168
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
He only met Cheng Xi

169
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
after he entered the Capital.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
That's right.

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,320
Both of my parents did die.

172
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's because my father was murdered by
his grandfather

173
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,920
when he tried to fight for the throne.

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,240
Winner makes the rules,
and losers live by them

175
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,640
Every dog has its day.

176
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,080
Back then, my father
lost against his grandfather.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,560
And now, look at
how incompetent you are.

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,679
It's time for you
to step down from the throne.

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,120
I knew it.

180
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
I always felt that something was wrong.

181
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,320
I was sure you weren't a nobody.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,440
So, you are a descendent of
the Qi Family as well.

183
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,280
So, who am I then?

184
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,240
Am I your true niece?

185
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Cheng Ruoyu entered the palace

186
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,000
eight years ago.

187
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,760
That's right.

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,600
So, Cheng Ruoyu's background

189
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
is fake.

190
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,280
So,

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
that leaves us with one last question.

192
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,840
Are Cheng Ruoyu and Cheng Xi

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,880
true relatives?

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
You are not my niece.

195
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,600
Back then, plenty of orphans
suffered from the famine.

196
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
You were lucky.

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Prince Guang had saved you.

198
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
I realised that you're talented

199
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,480
and that you have potential
in mastering martial arts.

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
That's why I took you in
with kind intention.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
Did you really do that
out of kind intention?

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
So, Your Majesty, you found out
about my plot.

203
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

204
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
I took her in

205
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,920
because I wanted to use her

206
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
to seduce you when she grows up.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,520
Your Majesty, although
you've fallen for my trick,

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400
it's a pity that the beauty
had turned against me.

209
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
I don't believe

210
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,320
in every word that you had uttered.

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
You actually betrayed me

212
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
and forgot about my kindness

213
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,760
because of a man.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,560
You shouldn't regret your decision
in the future.

215
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
I won't regret my decision.

216
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
One day,

217
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,920
you will see

218
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,960
Qi Yan's true colour.

219
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,360
For the sake of the throne,

220
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
he can be much crueller than me.

221
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,280
He can use everything to his advantage.

222
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
He can sacrifice everything
for the sake of the throne.

223
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
Enough.

224
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,320
What?

225
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,560
Are you afraid of my remarks?

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Did the late emperor really die

227
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,240
because Qiu Ziliang had fed him poison?

228
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
He was dead because
you forced him into a dead corner.

229
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
You forced him to die

230
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
in order to ascend the throne earlier.

231
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
How are you any better than me?

232
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
I said, enough!

233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Qi Yan,

234
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,320
for the sake of my father,

235
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
you need to die!

236
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
Your Majesty!

237
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,960
You ingrate!

238
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,480
Your Majesty!

239
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Your Majesty!

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,760
Your Majesty!

241
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,960
Your Majesty!

242
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,840
Your Majesty!

243
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,240
(You're not worthy enough
to be the emperor.)

244
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,040
(You're unambitious,)

245
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
(incompetent,)

246
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,560
(reckless,)

247
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
(and imprudent.)

248
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
You're right!

249
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,200
That's right!

250
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm unambitious!

251
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,920
Incompetent!

252
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
Reckless!

253
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
And imprudent!

254
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
(You're unable to embrace your duty
to get rid of the eunuch's faction)

255
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,320
(and restore the Xing empire.)

256
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
That's right.

257
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,560
I'm powerless to do so.

258
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm unable to embrace my duty.

259
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,040
(He can use everything
to his advantage.)

260
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,720
(He can sacrifice everything
for the sake of the throne.)

261
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
(You're not worthy enough
to be the emperor.)

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
(In order to ascend the throne earlier,)

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,360
(you forced the late emperor
to his grave!)

264
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,120
(You forced the late emperor
to his grave!)

265
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,280
(You forced the late emperor
to his grave!)

266
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
I didn't!

267
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
You're lying!

268
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,360
It wasn't me!

269
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,760
I wasn't the one who forced
the late emperor to his grave!

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't do so!

271
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,520
Your Majesty.

272
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,000
Prince Guang.

273
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,680
Uncle.

274
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,960
Your Majesty,

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,640
you were injured twice

276
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,480
in the same spot.

277
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,080
Now, there's a wound on your back.

278
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
No matter how strong your body is,

279
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
it won't be able to stand it
if you get injured again.

280
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,880
You need to rest

281
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,880
for the next month.

282
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
You mustn't fight

283
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,280
or tire yourself out.

284
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,160
Don't move.

285
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,760
Uncle,

286
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,840
it's impossible for me to do so.

287
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,320
You know that fact as well.

288
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,320
Nothing is impossible.

289
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
The appointment ceremony, which was

290
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,160
supposed to be held on this month,

291
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,360
has been postponed
until the 16th of next month.

292
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
Did Qiu Ziliang agree to it?

293
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,640
He has no choice but to agree to it.

294
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Prince An fell sick as well.

295
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
We didn't make him sick.

296
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,080
It's purely a coincidence.

297
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,160
This is a blessing in disguise.

298
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,480
You should rest well
using this opportunity.

299
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,120
If your wounds recur again,

300
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,760
even a deity won't be able to save you.

301
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,640
Uncle, sorry for the trouble.

302
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,920
You two, take care of His Majesty.

303
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
I will go and brew his medicine.

304
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,240
Yes, Prince Guang.

305
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,720
Uncle, sorry for the trouble.

306
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Who told you guys
to return to the palace

307
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,800
without my permission?

308
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,640
Your Majesty,

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
your servant humbly begs you.

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,280
Please don't chase me away!

311
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,680
Your Majesty,

312
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,960
your body

313
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
is in bad shape right now.

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,680
Your Majesty,

315
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,200
even if I were to die,

316
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
I will still stay beside you

317
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
and take care of you!

318
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,120
If you continue this, I will die

319
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,640
before you.

320
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,240
I deserve to die!

321
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,320
Enough.

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,720
You may stay then.

323
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
We will wait for
our impending doom together.

324
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

325
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,120
Aunt

326
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
has joined Qiu Ziliang's side.

327
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,760
Your Majesty, I didn't keep my promise.

328
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,840
Not only did I not
block the blow for you,

329
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,200
your old wound recurred because of me.

330
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
As my Sword Bearer,

331
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,600
you were negligent in your duty.

332
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,720
Your Majesty, please give me
another chance.

333
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,680
I've given you many chances.

334
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,720
But, you didn't achieve
my expectations at all.

335
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,400
Not only that,

337
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
you should never stay by my side

338
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
in the future.

339
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,920
Do not stay here any longer.

340
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,000
You will only create trouble for me.

341
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,160
You're useless to me.

342
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,800
You only serve to annoy me.

343
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,040
On account of our relationship
as king and subject,

344
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
I will reward you

345
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,560
with anything you want.

346
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Leave Changming Palace.

347
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,520
Leave Heng'an City.

348
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,160
Lead a carefree life.

349
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
Go and lead a carefree life

350
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
without any killings

351
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
and strife.

352
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,560
Your Majesty!

353
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
I cannot leave.

354
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,600
I know I have plenty of flaws.

355
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm rash, impulsive,

356
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
and I always get myself in trouble.

357
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,360
Your Majesty, I know I've annoyed you,

358
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
but I cannot leave.

359
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Your Majesty, I cannot
leave you here by yourself.

360
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
How could I be here by myself?

361
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,320
I have Li Deyun,

362
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Han Ding,

363
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,560
and the other loyal subjects.

364
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,200
I have Li Zening as well.

365
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,080
But, they're different from me.

366
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Your Majesty, I can stay beside you

367
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
and go through thick and thin together.

368
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,520
Your Majesty,

369
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,600
we had experienced

370
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
plenty of hardships together

371
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,560
before we got to where we are.

372
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Your Majesty, do you really
want to chase me away?

373
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,520
And, the things that Aunt had said

374
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
might not be true.

375
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
Maybe she just wanted

376
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
to upset you.

377
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Regarding my background

378
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
and Aunt's background,

379
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
there are many questionable points.

380
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,000
Your Majesty,

381
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,400
even though my looks may annoy you,

382
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,040
please endure it.

383
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,960
Please endure it until the dark clouds
have dissipated.

384
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Please endure it until
we get to the bottom of the truth.

385
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,840
Please endure it until
the world is at peace.

386
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Your Majesty,

387
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
please let me stay here.

388
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,440
If you want to chase me away,

389
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,520
death is the only way!

390
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,920
All right.

391
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,800
You may stay.

392
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
But, you need to consider three things
before you make your decision.

393
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Firstly,

395
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
Cheng Xi and I

396
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,160
will surely be at odds
against each other

397
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,960
until one of us is dead.

398
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,040
According to the law of Xing,
there are Ten Abominations.

399
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,200
Plotting rebellion,

400
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,280
plotting great sedition,

401
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,120
plotting treason,

402
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
and great irreverence,

403
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,520
Aunt had committed all of the above.

404
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
I will never cover up for her.

405
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
But, even now,
you still refer to her as Aunt.

406
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,040
Your Majesty, I just can't
get used to it yet.

407
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,080
Once I know about my true background,

408
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080
I will know what to do.

409
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,440
Fine.

410
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,280
Secondly,

411
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will marry Li Zening.

412
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I understand.

414
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,880
Thirdly,

415
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,280
I will never trust you again.

416
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
At least I won't trust you as much

417
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,840
compared with the past.

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,080
It is my fault.

420
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,720
Your Majesty,
I've abused your trust for me.

421
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Your Majesty, I'm grateful

422
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
that you're letting me stay.

423
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,440
So, let me ask you one last time.

425
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
Even if that's the case,

426
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,600
are you willing to stay by my side?

427
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

428
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,680
Cheng Ruoyu,

429
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm here today

430
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
to bid farewell to you.

431
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,360
Bid farewell?

432
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
Are you leaving?

433
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,840
Since I don't want

434
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,200
to serve anyone in the palace,

435
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,880
and I don't want anyone to serve me,

436
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
I have no choice but to leave.

437
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,360
Where are you going then?

438
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm going to find Wang Lin.

439
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
Wang Lin?

440
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
I can't defeat Traitor Qiu,

441
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
and you're protecting
that darned emperor.

442
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,000
But, at least

443
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
I can slay that beast, Wang Lin.

444
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,840
I will cease to be human

445
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
if I don't avenge my family.

446
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,240
You mustn't do so.

447
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,160
It's too dangerous for you.

448
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
I've made up no mind.

449
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,000
Say no more.

450
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,760
Farewell.

451
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,800
Ziyuan!

452
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Save your breath.

453
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,400
You're trying to find Wang Lin
by yourself?

454
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,320
You're not avenging your family.

455
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,400
You're seeking your own death.

456
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
That darned eunuch is safe

457
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
because he has his men by his side.

458
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
As long as he's alone,

459
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,120
I have a chance to kill him.

460
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
He's our common enemy.

461
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,760
I'll follow you.

462
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,880
You want to follow me?

463
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,640
No.

464
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,320
Cheng Ruoyu,

465
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,600
I know you're a kind person.

466
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,480
But, you'll always be my enemy

467
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,640
as long as you follow Qi Yan.

468
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,360
Ziyuan!

469
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,600
Stop hindering me.

470
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,560
Sir, I deserve to die

471
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
for postponing your
appointment ceremony.

472
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,080
Before this, the fortune-teller told me
that the date isn't suitable.

473
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,560
He suggested me to change the date
to the 16th of next month.

474
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,160
I didn't agree with him back then.

475
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
I didn't expect this to happen.

476
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,600
Seems like this is my fate.

477
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,840
Cheng Xi,

478
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,920
you may rise.

479
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
You shouldn't return

480
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,080
to the Violet Bureau for now.

481
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
You can stay here

482
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
together with your subordinates.

483
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,600
Sir, thank you for taking us in.

484
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,920
I heard from Prince An

485
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
that he was together with

486
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,680
Princess Misha before this.

487
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,040
Now, he has returned.

488
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,960
But, where's the princess?

489
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,840
Sir, the princess
was gifted to you long ago.

490
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,480
She was gifted to me?

491
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,680
To His Majesty and Li Deyun,

492
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
Liu Misha is much more important

493
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,920
than Prince An.

494
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,600
Sir,

495
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
I've sent her to you long ago

496
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
just in case anything happens.

497
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,480
To put it more accurately,

498
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
I've sent her to Wang Lin's residence.

499
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
This is interesting.

500
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Sir, are you trying to ask

501
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,320
why I didn't send Liu Misha

502
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,680
to you directly?

503
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,560
It's simple.

504
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,920
It's because I don't trust
the Chess of Generals Camp.

505
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,960
Especially that Qiu Yanzhi.

506
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
Eunuch Qiu told the servants
to prepare his carriage

507
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
as he was going to
head to Wang Lin's residence.

508
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,520
I wonder why.

509
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,560
Wang Lin, Jiang Ding, Yuan Xing,

510
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,160
the three Central Commanders
of the Shencai Army,

511
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,040
are vital to Qiu Ziliang.

512
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,960
Jiang Ding hasn't made up his mind yet.

513
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
As for Wang Lin and Yuan Xing,

514
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,160
they swore loyalty to Eunuch Qiu.

515
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,640
We just need to think of a way

516
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,760
to make Wang Lin and Yuan Xing
turn against each other.

517
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,040
We'll force Jiang Ding

518
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
to seek our help.

519
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,360
Yes.

520
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,280
(I wonder how Ziyuan is doing?)

521
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,520
Support me, I want to take a walk.

522
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,920
Your Majesty,

523
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,400
you mustn't do so.

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
Prince Guang has
given me his instruction.

525
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,960
Your Majesty, you can only
lie down for now.

526
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,080
I'm just going outside
to take a breather.

527
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,000
Your Majesty, your body
can't stand the wind.

528
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,160
Your Majesty,

529
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,320
allow me to carry you on my back.

530
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,920
Your Majesty, the Grand Empress Dowager
was very worried about you

531
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,080
when she heard that you were sick.

532
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,200
Since the weather is great today,

533
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,640
Your Majesty, please allow me
to accompany you for your walk.

534
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,360
Prepare the palanquin.

535
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,800
Speaking of which,

536
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Your Majesty, you were the one
who had introduced it to me.

537
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,280
Do you still remember?

538
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
When I was young,

539
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,000
I couldn't walk as I sprained my foot.

540
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,240
Your Majesty,

541
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
you gave me a palanquin because of that.

542
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,560
You even accompanied me

543
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,160
as we flew kites in the courtyard.

544
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,280
Do you actually remember that?

545
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,440
Your Majesty, I had never
forgotten anything

546
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,280
that was related to you.

547
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,800
Your Majesty.

548
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,840
His Majesty is leaving the palace.

549
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,240
Your Majesty,

550
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,120
look.

551
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,960
Give it a try.

552
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,840
Your Majesty!

553
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
Your Majesty, are you okay?

554
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,840
Your Majesty,

555
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
this will affect your injury.

556
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,280
I think it's better for you to stop.

557
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Your Majesty!

558
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
Sword Bearer, looks like
you're very concerned about His Majesty.

559
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,680
You're so loyal to your master.

560
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
You're making it
as if we're the crooks here.

561
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,680
Yu'er,

562
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,960
apologise to Miss Li immediately.

563
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
My apologise, Miss Li.

564
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
I overstepped my boundaries.

565
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,240
Speaking of which, I was the one
who was being reckless here.

566
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,480
I just thought that I could
make His Majesty happy

567
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
by catching up with him.

568
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,360
I didn't expect it
to be so windy out here.

569
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,880
Your Majesty, I think

570
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,440
we should return first.

571
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,120
All right.

572
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,120
Raise.

573
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,200
Turn.

574
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,560
Miss Cheng,

575
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
His Majesty is under my care.

576
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,840
You do not need to follow him
wherever he goes.

577
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,920
(Since I don't have
anything to do here,)

578
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,720
(why don't I look for Ziyuan?)

579
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,520
(Wang Lin is one of
Qiu Ziliang's trusted subordinates.)

580
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
(Pull one hair and
the whole body moves.)

581
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,400
(I mustn't let Ziyuan
do anything silly.)

582
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,240
(Let me report this
to His Majesty first.)

583
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,320
I can do it myself.

584
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,640
Your Majesty,

585
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,920
seems like

586
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
you're still hesitant about it.

587
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,360
So, are you regretting

588
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,720
that you've chosen me?

589
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,800
I've never chosen you.

590
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,600
It is just an act.

591
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,680
You'll act
while I enjoy your performance.

592
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,960
Isn't that the case?

593
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,640
Aren't you afraid of my father?

594
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,560
Your father is your father,

595
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,080
you are you.

596
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,320
If your father wants to make a comeback,

597
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,360
he still needs to depend on me.

598
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,480
There's no need for him

599
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
to patronise me.

600
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
You can keep your feelings

601
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,080
to yourself.

602
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,120
But,

603
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,840
you've been keeping Ru Feng

604
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,080
because I gave it to you, right?

605
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
I kept it because horses are loyal.

606
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,560
They won't betray their owners,

607
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,560
not to mention kicking them
while they're down

608
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,600
and threatening them.

609
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,960
Huaizhi,

610
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
do you have something to say?

611
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,719
No...

612
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,199
No.

613
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Does everyone think

614
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,679
that I need to depend on women

615
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,560
in order to defeat Qiu Ziliang?

616
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,080
Do you believe that I can defeat him?

617
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,800
Of course, Your Majesty.

618
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,159
That's a given.

619
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,679
I believe so.

620
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,639
No.

621
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,360
None of you believes me.

622
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,679
None of you.

623
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,520
Now,

624
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,440
there's only one person in the world

625
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,280
who truly believes in me.

626
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,800
(That's why)

627
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,200
(I need to protect her.)

628
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
(In order to protect her,)

629
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,920
(I mustn't let her)

630
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
(get too close to me.)

631
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
(Qiu Ziliang?)

632
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,440
(Why is he at
Wang Lin's residence as well?)

633
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,680
Grandfather!

634
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,840
Grandfather!

635
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,000
You may relay your orders to me
if you need anything.

636
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,880
Grandfather, there's no need for you

637
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,160
to visit me personally.

638
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
Stand properly.

639
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,440
The breeze will come
when the lotus is in full bloom,

640
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,160
understood?

641
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,960
Lotus?

642
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,800
You don't understand me?

643
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Where have you hidden the lady

644
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,560
whom you've captured two days ago?

645
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,120
In the secret chamber.

646
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,600
Did you touch her?

647
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,440
I didn't.

648
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,680
Bring me there.

649
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,520
Grandfather, please.

650
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
(The lady he has captured?)

651
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,280
(Don't tell me it's Misha?)

652
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,720
(No.)

653
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,960
(I can't do this alone.)

654
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,200
(But, I won't make it in time)

655
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,840
(if I report this to His Majesty.)

656
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,840
(What should I do?)

657
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Grandfather.

658
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Grandfather, be careful.

659
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
There are some steps over here.

660
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,320
Please mind your steps.

661
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
Grandfather, this place is quite dark.

662
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
Sir, please show mercy!

663
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,640
Sir, please show mercy!

664
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,360
Grandfather,

665
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
just tell me if you've taken a liking
to them.

666
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,880
I'll send them to you immediately.

667
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Raise your head.

668
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
Sir, please show mercy!

669
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,400
Sir, please show mercy!

670
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,160
How is it?

671
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,480
Grandfather,
what do you think about her?

672
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,400
Grandfather, do you like her?

673
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,720
Don't you know

674
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,160
who she is?

675
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,240
Princess Misha?

676
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,560
Useless fool.

677
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,880
You were exploited,

678
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,440
yet you don't have any idea at all.

679
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,240
Grandfather, I didn't touch her at all!

680
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
I really didn't know

681
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
that it was her!

682
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Grandfather!

683
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,520
I really don't know

684
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,200
how she came to be here.

685
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,000
Grandfather, how about this?

686
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
I'll send her back immediately,

687
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,600
okay?

688
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,000
Grandfather?

689
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,200
No.

690
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,080
Let her stay here.

691
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,600
Keep her safe, do you understand?

692
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,480
I understand.

693
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,160
Keep her safe?

694
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
I will surely take good care of her.

695
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,160
You may continue.

696
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,280
Grandfather!

697
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,560
Grandfather, don't worry.

698
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,960
(This is strange.)

699
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,680
(I don't see Misha.)

700
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,360
Keep an eye on her,

701
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,240
understood?

702
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,480
Yes, sir.

703
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,200
I will deal with the others.

704
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,360
Ziyuan.

705
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,120
It's me.

706
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,880
Let's go.

707
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,000
Hurry.

708
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,880
I was worried

709
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
that you might come here alone.

710
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,680
That's why I came.

711
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,360
Wang Lin is an animal.

712
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
Liu Misha is inside the secret chamber.

713
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
Princess Misha?

714
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,120
Are you sure?

715
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm sure of it.

716
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,080
How do we reach the secret chamber?

717
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,960
To make it convenient for him

718
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,840
to satisfy his lust at any time,

719
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,360
there's a hidden path in his room
that can bring us to the secret chamber.

720
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,080
Follow me.

721
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,960
A beggar

722
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,760
with a horse

723
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
came and said

724
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,800
that he has a message for you.

725
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,120
A beggar?

726
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,720
What message?

727
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
Sha is at Wang Lin's dome.

728
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,120
Wang Lin's dome?

729
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,320
Wang Lin?

730
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,760
Liu Misha is at Wang Lin's residence?

731
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,320
Who was the sender of the message?

732
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,320
Little Fish.

733
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,080
Are you sure?

734
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm sure of it.

735
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
I recognise her horse.

736
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,400
Are the pawns we planted beside Wang Lin

737
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,240
ready for action?

738
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes.

739
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,040
They're waiting for our orders.

740
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,360
Tell them

741
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,000
to assist Cheng Ruoyu
in saving the captive.

742
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,120
Yes.

743
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,600
No one's here. Let's go.

744
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,400
Let's go.

745
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,280
Misha?

746
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,720
She was drugged by Aunt.

747
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,640
Do you know where are the keys?

748
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Wang Lin is carrying them.

749
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,400
I'll steal them from him.

750
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
I'm more familiar with the place.

751
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,760
I'll do it.

752
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
Both of us can go together.

753
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,920
We can look out for each other.

754
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,920
All right.

755
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,440
Let's drink.

756
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,040
Official Wang, here's a toast to you.

757
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,360
What a joyous day.

758
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,840
Bottoms up.

759
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,520
This is great.

760
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,120
Sir,

761
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,160
was the person who came
to visit you today

762
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,720
the renowned

763
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,680
Duke Chu?

764
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,480
That's right.

765
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,560
What's the matter?

766
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,320
Sir,

767
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,440
you're favoured by Duke Chu indeed.

768
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,240
He even came to visit you personally.

769
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,840
You have great taste.

770
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
Sir, you're a great drinker.

771
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,280
Sir!

772
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,000
Didn't you say

773
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,080
that you were going
to accompany me tonight?

774
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
Why are you staring at her?

775
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,560
I'm upset now.

776
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,960
Are you jealous?

777
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,160
Reporting in!

778
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Sir, this is bad!

779
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
The backyard is on fire!

780
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,440
What?

781
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,840
The backyard?

782
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,720
Yes, sir.

783
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,600
Go and extinguish the fire!

784
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,720
Yes, sir!

785
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,880
Sir,

786
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm scared!

787
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,160
I'm sure someone is trying
to lure me there.

788
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,240
Everyone, let's take our seats for now.

789
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,600
Yu'er has been missing
for the entire night.

790
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
Did she fall asleep?

791
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,600
I will summon her immediately.

792
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,760
No need for that.

793
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,280
Let her sleep for a little longer.
