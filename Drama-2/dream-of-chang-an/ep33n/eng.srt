14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,840
We brought Prince Guang here already.

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm useless.

17
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
I didn't handle things well,

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,760
and I even made you feel bad.

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,480
And Little Fish too.

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
I originally wanted to save her,

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
but I wasn't able to in the end.

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,440
What are you doing?

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,400
Making her look beautiful

24
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
is the last thing

25
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
that I can do for Little Fish.

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
She's not Little Fish.

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
Her name is Wang Ruoling.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
She's my sister.

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,160
My biological sister.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
Duke Chu.

31
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,160
Round and round,

32
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,880
I didn't expect

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
that the throne

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,960
will go to you in the end.

35
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,280
His Majesty will get better.

36
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,800
It seems like you have
a good relationship

37
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
with your nephew.

38
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,440
Your Highness Prince Guang,
who lived in seclusion from the world,

39
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
make do with the situation first.

40
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,920
For the poison Right Minister sent,

41
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,640
after injecting it into the body,

42
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,960
it would react

43
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,800
with the medicine Yu'er took before,

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,320
making her nose and mouth bleed

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,880
and leading her to stop
breathing temporarily

46
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
and seem dead.

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Let me go.

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm going to save Ruoling.

49
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,240
Yanzhi.

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,120
Listen to me.

51
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,200
How will you save her?

52
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,440
With your eyes full of tears

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,440
and utterly distracted,

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,280
how are you going to save her
from Qiu Ziliang's clutch?

55
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
We don't need to save her.

56
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
We must kill her.

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
Use His Majesty's poison.

58
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as she takes
the antidote in time,

59
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,680
she'll wake up.

60
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,960
But Qiu Ziliang was still suspicious.

61
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,840
He personally struck her.

62
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,360
Good thing Yu'er was wearing
soft protective armor.

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
That's why she survived.

64
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Back then, Qi Yan personally
shot you two.

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,280
And now,

66
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,640
your sister became his confidant.

67
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,080
Before,

68
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,360
you and your sister

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,960
fought so much too.

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
It's heart-wrenching,

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,000
isn't it?

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,120
What are you planning to do next?

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Will you tell Little...

74
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,960
Will you tell Ruoling the truth?

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,480
She's so loyal to Qi Yan.

76
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,640
She surely won't believe me.

77
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
She has already suffered so much.

78
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
Since I've already found her,

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I must protect her.

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,680
I can't let her

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
suffer any more harm.

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,080
Your Majesty.

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,320
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,880
Your Majesty.

86
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
You're finally awake.

87
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
His Majesty's awake!

88
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,960
(I must wait for Yu'er to return.)

89
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
(How can I just die like this?)

90
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
First toast.

91
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
Thank you for collecting

92
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,680
my grandfather's corpse back then

93
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,160
and burying him.

94
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Second.

95
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
Thank you for saving my sister back then

96
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
and letting her grow up safely.

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Third.

98
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Thank you for stopping me

99
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,280
from making a big mistake today.

100
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,080
I won't forget

101
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,920
everything you did.

102
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,560
Ruoqing.

103
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
You know what I want.

104
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
If you really want to thank me...

105
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
That's the only thing

106
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,680
I can't agree to.

107
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,920
Ruoqing.

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
You've found your sister.

109
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
In this world,

110
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,840
you're not alone anymore.

111
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,720
Why don't you leave Heng'an

112
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,360
with Ruoling

113
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,800
and find a good place

114
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,680
to spend the rest of your life?

115
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Why are you so obsessed with revenge?

116
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Ruoqing's survival

117
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,200
isn't enough to eliminate my hatred
for the killing of the Wang clan.

118
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,080
Besides,

119
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
you know this.

120
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,520
It's already too late.

121
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
Even if I want to leave,

122
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,360
Qiu Ziliang wouldn't let me go either.

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Should I bring my sister along,

124
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,520
hide, and live an ignoble existence

125
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,240
for the rest of our lives?

126
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
Go to the Arab Empire.

127
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,280
Go to Tibet.

128
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,000
The world is so big.

129
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,560
There's not only the Xing empire.

130
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
But other places

131
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,280
aren't my nation.

132
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,240
Yanzhi.

133
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,240
You're awake?

134
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,080
Qiu Ziliang struck you in the chest.

135
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,040
You should thank
Prince Guang's medicine.

136
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm not dead?

137
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Thank you as well, Yanzhi.

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
And His Majesty's soft armor too.

139
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,400
Qi Yan gave you the soft armor?

140
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
After Shi Yuan stabbed him,

141
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,440
in order to take precautions,

142
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,040
I stole the soft armor from the vault.

143
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
Before I left,

144
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,480
His Majesty took it off

145
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,200
and gave it to me.

146
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,400
His Majesty is quite nice to you.

147
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
It wasn't a waste for you
to risk your life for him.

148
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,680
Yanzhi.

149
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,800
Where's His Majesty?

150
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,560
How is he?

151
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,320
He's fine.

152
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Listen to me.

153
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
From now on,

154
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Cheng Ruoyu will not exist anymore.

155
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,680
Why?

156
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Because Cheng Ruoyu

157
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,960
was already poisoned to death.

158
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
You're Yanzhi indeed.

159
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
That's a brilliant plan.

160
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,520
For Qi Yan's sake,

161
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,560
you can disregard your life?

162
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Then you should know

163
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,440
what's most important

164
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
to him now.

165
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,640
Anyway,

166
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
from now on,

167
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
Cheng Ruoyu doesn't exist anymore.

168
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,560
Your name is Ling Ling.

169
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,160
Work for me from now on.

170
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
I didn't agree to that.

171
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,640
You have no choice.

172
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,040
(Chess of Generals Camp)

173
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Your Majesty!

174
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,080
Your Majesty!

175
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,240
Huaizhi.

176
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Your Majesty.

177
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,720
I'm back to serve you.

178
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,160
Your Majesty, you've grown thinner.

179
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Why are you back?

180
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,480
I heard that you're critically ill,

181
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,080
so I begged Official Qiu.

182
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,000
In the end, Official Qiu

183
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,680
finally agreed to let me come back

184
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,120
and serve you.

185
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
That's good.

186
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,840
It's good that you're back.

187
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm never leaving again.

188
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
I'll serve you forever.

189
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,640
If you keep crying,

190
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,520
I won't be able to recover.

191
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
I'll

192
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,640
smile.

193
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,360
I'll smile for you.

194
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,760
Does it still hurt?

195
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,160
Not anymore.

196
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,280
But don't treat me this way.

197
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm not quite used to it.

198
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
What have you

199
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,240
been thinking

200
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
all day long?

201
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Nothing.

202
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,880
However,

203
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,560
I find it quite strange.

204
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,480
Why...

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Why are you

206
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,160
suddenly treating me
like we're so close?

207
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,720
You said

208
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,360
that we're friends,

209
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,400
didn't you?

210
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,320
If we're friends,

211
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,640
let me leave.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
That won't do.

213
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,000
You need to rest.

214
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,720
But the military situation is urgent.

215
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I have to go.

216
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,160
Ling Ling.

217
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,360
Listen to me.

218
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,880
There's something very important

219
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,000
for you to do now.

220
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,800
What's this?

221
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,599
Qi Yan and Li Deyun

222
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
want to mobilize troops from everywhere

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,800
to defeat Lucong.

224
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,359
This is the related information.

225
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,440
In order to make this plan work,

226
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
someone with martial arts skill,

227
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,800
especially one with excellent
Qinggong kungfu, is needed.

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,520
It's better if she knows
about Zhang Jiang.

229
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,280
Isn't that me?

230
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,720
Is it

231
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
really worth it

232
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,840
to you to do all these for Qi Yan?

233
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
It's not only for His Majesty.

234
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,160
It's also for Xing's sake.

235
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,680
Then listen to me.

236
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,800
Tomorrow,

237
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,880
Li Zening

238
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
will leave the capital
in the name of visiting her family

239
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,480
and pass through here.

240
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
She'll bring you along
after staying here for one night.

241
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Li Deyun also has an initial plan.

242
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
Just listen to his instructions.

243
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,200
This is my token.

244
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,000
If you need help,

245
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,080
light this flare.

246
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Chess of Generals Camp's spy

247
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,200
will get in touch with you.

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
Your Majesty.

249
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,120
Huaizhi.

250
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes.

251
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
What's the matter?

252
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Nothing.

253
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,600
You're not willing to tell me?

254
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

255
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,440
Today

256
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,120
is

257
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,720
the death anniversary of a relative.

258
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,920
That's why

259
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,840
I wasn't unable

260
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
to control my emotions.

261
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,840
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

262
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,080
Rise.

263
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,720
In that case,

264
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
go and rest.

265
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,360
You can come tomorrow.

266
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,840
Seeing you so sad

267
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
makes me feel bad too.

268
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,160
Go.

269
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

270
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Your Majesty, do you want to know

271
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
why Eunuch Cheng is sad?

272
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,880
You know why?

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
Yes.

274
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
However,

275
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,040
it's better for you not to know.

276
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Did something happen to Yu'er?

277
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,120
Tell me.

278
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm asking

279
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
if something happened to Yu'er.

280
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,320
Tell me.

281
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Yanzhi.

282
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,560
I can't quite figure something out.

283
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,920
You're helping me
and His Majesty so much.

284
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,640
And you're even betraying Qiu Ziliang.

285
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,280
What exactly do you want?

286
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
I want to become empress.

287
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,920
I want Qi Yan's heart.

288
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
You...

289
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
You're serious?

290
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,640
I've always been serious.

291
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,160
I have only one motive
for helping you two.

292
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,640
I want you to leave Qi Yan

293
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
and never return to his side.

294
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,960
No.

295
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm going back to the palace.

296
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
I want to let His Majesty know
that I'm alive.

297
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,520
And then what?

298
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,200
Let Qiu Ziliang kill you again

299
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,440
in front of His Majesty?

300
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,400
In order to save you,

301
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,280
me,

302
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Prince Guang,

303
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Yan Xiu,

304
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,840
and countless people

305
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,240
risked our lives.

306
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,840
Just because of Qi Yan,

307
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,760
you're disregarding all of our lives?

308
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,440
Ling Ling.

309
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm not Ling Ling.

310
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,320
You are.

311
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,400
Starting today,

312
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,720
Cheng Ruoyu doesn't exist.

313
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
Only Ling Ling does.

314
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,160
You can be

315
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,280
the firmest assistant of Qi Yan

316
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,320
and hide in the dark

317
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,600
to overturn the situation for him

318
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
and help him win.

319
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,640
Your Majesty.

320
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,120
You must take seven medicines today

321
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,960
and get treated
with 49 acupuncture needles.

322
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
I'll make myself clear first.

323
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,520
The medicines are very bitter.

324
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
The needles will hurt a lot.

325
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,680
How long do I have to live?

326
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,920
I've never met anyone

327
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,680
with such a strong desire
to survive like you.

328
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,000
Perhaps the heaven is merciful

329
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,920
and can create miracles.

330
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,160
How long if there's a miracle then?

331
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,560
Your Majesty.

332
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,720
Around five years.

333
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,200
All right.

334
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,320
Let's aim for five years then.

335
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,880
However,

336
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
Your Majesty, you must be prepared.

337
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,600
It's possible

338
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,400
that you won't be able
to survive more than five months.

339
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,400
(After leaving this time,)

340
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,040
(I wonder when I'll be able)

341
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,200
(to see His Majesty again.)

342
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,880
(Will it be like what Yanzhi said)

343
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,240
(that I won't be able)

344
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,400
(to return to His Majesty's side again?)

345
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,040
The priority now

346
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,760
is to quell Lucong's rebellion.

347
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,480
I can't be immersed
in personal relationships.

348
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,000
Cheng Ruoyu.

349
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm commanding you

350
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,760
to stop thinking of ridiculous things.

351
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,320
Not bad.

352
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
If all patients

353
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,160
are as cooperative as you,

354
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
physicians like us

355
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,560
will have fewer troubles.

356
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,200
Gao Ping

357
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,680
told His Majesty

358
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
that Cheng Ruoyu is dead.

359
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,080
He's such a blabbermouth.

360
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,120
But His Majesty

361
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,760
didn't seem to have much of a reaction.

362
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,600
Raise your head.

363
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,440
Explain it

364
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
to me carefully.

365
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,800
What do you mean by not having
much of a reaction?

366
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,120
After... After His Majesty
heard about it,

367
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
he just took his medicines

368
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,600
and received needle treatment.

369
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Then he went to sleep.

370
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,200
The divine healer said

371
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,160
that His Majesty had
a strong desire for survival.

372
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
What do you think?

373
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,120
You were originally worried
that His Majesty

374
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
finally survived,

375
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,320
but after hearing
what happened to Cheng Ruoyu,

376
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,160
he might collapse again.

377
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,840
But now,

378
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
he might want

379
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,880
revenge.

380
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Revenge?

381
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,640
Only revenge can make one
pull oneself together.

382
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,920
It seems like

383
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,680
he wants to seek revenge
for Little Fish.

384
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
Should we keep him alive then?

385
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,080
Qi Yan's hatred for me

386
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,600
can't be concealed.

387
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
This kind of person isn't that scary.

388
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,280
As for Prince Guang,

389
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
since the very beginning,

390
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,520
I've never seen through him.

391
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,200
If I'm not left with no other choice,

392
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
I won't replace him.

393
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,400
Where's my Qingguang?

394
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,480
It's time to eat.

395
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,200
You always come here.

396
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,920
Won't Qiu Ziliang become suspicious?

397
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
You're worried about me?

398
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,760
Have some porridge,

399
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,240
Ling Ling.

400
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,160
I don't like the name Ling Ling.

401
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
But I like it.

402
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm going to sleep.

403
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,040
You...

404
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,760
Eat first before sleeping.

405
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,240
Here.

406
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm an adult.

407
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,440
I can eat on my own.

408
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,600
(What is she doing?)

409
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,400
You shouldn't

410
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
keep staring at me.

411
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,320
I won't run away.

412
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
I haven't seen you for a long time.

413
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,400
Didn't you see me

414
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,800
this morning?

415
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,000
You're too thin.

416
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,120
And you have so many wounds
all over your body.

417
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,600
Eat more.

418
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,000
Qiu Yanzhi.

419
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,400
You looked all over my body?

420
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
When did you do that?

421
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Go.

422
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm already full.

423
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,880
I have to go to bed.

424
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,200
You're leaving tomorrow,

425
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
and I can't accompany you.

426
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
I don't need you to accompany me.

427
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,080
All right.

428
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll get going then.

429
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,240
Remember to light the flare
if there's danger.

430
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,600
All right.

431
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,160
(Looking at the sister)

432
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,800
(whom she just found again,)

433
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
(Qiu Yanzhi couldn't hide)

434
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,840
(her happiness.)

435
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,000
(But she knows)

436
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,360
(that she can't)

437
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,600
(tell Yu'er the truth yet.)

438
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,640
(Because she hasn't taken revenge yet.)

439
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,280
(She hasn't accomplished the great plan.)

440
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
(She can't become distracted)

441
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,200
(because of momentary happiness.)

442
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,560
I'll get going.

443
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,560
Why do I feel like

444
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
His Majesty isn't whom she likes,

445
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,960
but me?

446
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
Qiu Yanzhi.

447
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
This all makes sense now.

448
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:58,982
(Memorial to the Throne)

449
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,320
Gao Ping.

450
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,480
Your Majesty.

451
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,160
I

452
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
want to pay respects to Qi Ang.

453
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,520
If it's difficult for you,

454
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
you can ask Duke Chu.

455
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,080
Now?

456
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,640
Now.

457
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,920
Yes.

458
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,760
Wait outside.

459
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
I'll go inside by myself.

460
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,360
Don't come in.

461
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes.

462
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Can you take good care of yourself?

463
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,360
Can you take good care

464
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,240
of your siblings?

465
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,920
If you win,

466
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,160
Xing will prosper.

467
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,920
If you lose,

468
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,920
Xing will perish.

469
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,640
Wang Yang,

470
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,040
Zheng Lu,

471
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,000
me,

472
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
and the thousands of people

473
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,920
who died in the Morning Dew Rebellion

474
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,560
can all die

475
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,800
for your victory!

476
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,040
So tell me.

477
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,960
Can you win?

478
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,683
(Emperor Qi Ang's Memorial Tablet)

479
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,943
(Emperor Qi Ang's Memorial Tablet)

480
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,440
Qi Ang.

481
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,880
Perhaps I won't be able
to take good care of myself.

482
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,800
Perhaps I won't be able
to take good care

483
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,600
of my siblings.

484
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,880
However,

485
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,760
we can surely win.

486
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,527
(Emperor Qi Ang's Memorial Tablet)

487
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,200
Your Majesty.

488
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,480
Your Majesty.

489
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
How can you disregard yourself this way?

490
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,920
You keep wandering around.

491
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,520
Look at you.

492
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm just not around for one day,

493
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,239
and this is how you work.

494
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,239
Huaizhi.

495
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Do you know where Yu'er is buried?

496
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,159
You know what happened to Yu'er?

497
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,520
I heard that she was thrown
to the mass grave.

498
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Bring people and search for her.

499
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,800
If you find her,

500
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
bring her back.

501
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,560
I

502
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,280
want to give her a grand burial.

503
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,560
Yes.

504
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,880
Up.

505
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,360
Let's go.

506
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
While it's not 9 pm yet,

507
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,800
deliver these to her.

508
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,200
This trip to Lucong is so dangerous.

509
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Ling Ling is even seriously injured.

510
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,800
Even if she's wearing soft armor,

511
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,760
and there are hidden weapons,

512
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,160
these won't do.

513
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,400
I must send more people to protect her.

514
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,720
Double Cannons.

515
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,240
They don't have any missions now.

516
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,000
Transfer them back

517
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,800
to protect her.

518
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,400
I'll deliver these personally.

519
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,200
Perhaps

520
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,600
I can see her more.

521
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,440
What are you doing?

522
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,920
I should ask you

523
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,080
what you're doing.

524
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,480
You arranged

525
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
for a bunch of soldiers to protect her.

526
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,400
You're even sending
so many things there.

527
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,520
Do you want her to attract
a lot of attention?

528
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,600
If Official Qiu notices something,

529
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,240
what would you do?

530
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,800
I know.

531
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,160
You just found your sister.

532
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,920
You're very worried about her.

533
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,360
However,

534
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
this is too much.

535
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
I almost can't recognize you anymore.

536
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Yanzhi.

537
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,120
Sober up.

538
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,840
I'm just...

539
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm just too happy.

540
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320
I'm so happy,

541
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Xiu.

542
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,040
I know.

543
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm happy for you too.

544
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,320
Sir.

545
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,520
Tell me.

546
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,320
All right.

547
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,080
You may go.

548
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Qi Yan wants that corpse.

549
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,080
Give him what we prepared.

550
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,560
Yes.

551
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,680
Your Majesty.

552
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,760
We found Yu'er.

553
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,120
We found Yu'er.

554
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,880
Where is she?

555
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,280
She's being transported back.

556
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,080
But Yu'er...

557
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,800
Tell me.

558
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,280
When we found her in the mass grave,

559
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,400
I only recognized her through her sword.

560
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,080
Her face is already destroyed.

561
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,920
Your Majesty.

562
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,680
This is the Qingguang sword

563
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,320
Yu'er had around her waist.

564
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,040
I brought it back.

565
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,840
Your Majesty.

00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:23,140
♪Like a boat being swallowed up
