=Episode 48=

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,840
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
I have failed you.

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,160
I couldn't find Official Han.

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,440
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,440
Perhaps it's better to take a day off

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,720
from the imperial court meeting.

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,440
I must attend

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,680
the imperial court meeting today.

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
Has Yu'er left the palace?

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
As per your order,

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I reminded her this morning

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,920
to send her sister back
for a proper burial.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
Judging by the time now,

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
she should be on her way.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
It's good to know that.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,960
There will be a fierce battle today.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't have

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
the strength

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
to keep her safe.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
But that place

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,880
is populated

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
and full of secret tunnels.

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
A complicated structure

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,520
gives her a better chance of survival.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,720
She is alert.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Not to mention Yan Xiu is with her.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
I believe

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
she will survive this ordeal.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,000
Huaizhi.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
After I've attended
the imperial court meeting,

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
take your retirement letter

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,600
and leave this palace.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,560
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
You've thought of an escape plan

49
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,480
for all of us.

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,440
But what will you do?

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,480
There is no way for me to get out.

52
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,120
There was never an escape plan for me.

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
Your Majesty!

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,280
Yanzhi.

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
Ruoling and I

57
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,240
are here to see you off.

58
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
You could have gone anywhere

59
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
but this place.

60
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,080
Hand over the posthumous edict.

61
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
It's what's best for both of us.

62
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
When did they install this contraption?

63
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,280
Search for them!

64
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
Yes!

65
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,880
My sister foresaw this?

66
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Come with me.

67
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
What about my sister?

68
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,320
This place is safe.

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,200
We'll come back for her

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
when the job is done.

71
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Let's go.

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Why isn't Official Li here yet?

73
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
I don't know.

74
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Before we parted ways yesterday,

75
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,920
he promised he would be here today.

76
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,280
Perhaps he's ill?

77
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,039
You...

78
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,080
How dare you drug me?

79
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,160
One mistake

80
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
will lead to countless more.

81
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,560
Yes.

82
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
I made a mistake back then.

83
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
So this time,

84
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
I won't make the same mistake again.

85
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,240
What's wrong?

86
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,960
It's here.

87
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,400
My grandfather once

88
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
took my sister and I to this place.

89
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,640
The exit...

90
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,360
The exit is over there.

91
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
You've regained your memory.

92
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,280
I will finish
what my grandfather started

93
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
years ago.

94
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,720
Your Majesty.

95
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,120
Qiu Ziliang is full of
lies and deceptions.

96
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,960
He has no regard for the laws,

97
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,000
stashed weapons illegally,

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
and hired his own private troops.

99
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,840
He assassinated two princes,

100
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,720
our Empress,

101
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
and the four Ministers.

102
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
He was removed from his titles,

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,800
but the people are not satisfied
with his punishment.

104
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,800
His crimes are beyond unspeakable!

105
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,720
We request for Your Majesty
to pass wise judgment

106
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,560
on the Qiu Ziliang and his ilk.

107
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,920
Their punishment shall serve
as a reminder to the world.

108
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
How should I proceed
with the investigation?

109
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,560
This is the name list of those
in cahoot with Qiu Ziliang.

110
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Please have a look.

111
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,060
(Liu Zhixuan, Liang Zhihuan)

112
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,550
(Jiang Lin, Zhou Ping, Liu Ding)

113
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,120
Qiu Ziliang surrendered yesterday,

114
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
(Name list of Qiu Ziliang's followers)
and the name list is already presented to me.

115
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,400
Your efficiency in handling the matter

116
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,400
has impressed me deeply.

117
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,800
We request for Your Majesty
to punish these villains

118
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
and cleanse the Imperial Court
of their corruption.

119
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
We request for Your Majesty
to punish these villains

120
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,520
and cleanse the Imperial Court
of their corruption.

121
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,000
There is nowhere to run now.

122
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,880
Did Prince Guang

123
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,840
send you after me?

124
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
I still can't believe Prince Guang

125
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,280
is actually an evil villain.

126
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,040
A villain?

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
He was never a villain.

128
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,080
Qi Yan is the real problem here.

129
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,760
You have no right to
slander His Majesty.

130
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,760
You may open

131
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,440
the scroll

132
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,000
if you don't believe us.

133
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Find out who is

134
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,600
the rightful heir to the throne.

135
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
You want the posthumous edict.

136
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,400
Then come and get it.

137
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,400
I never like

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,160
using violence.

139
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Not to mention

140
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,520
you are Miss Yanzhi's little sister.

141
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Hand over the posthumous edict.

142
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll let you go.

143
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,040
I promise you won't be hurt.

144
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
It belongs to Prince Guang

145
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
all along.

146
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
The Late Emperor ordered Han Yue
to give it to

147
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,520
your grandfather.

148
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,240
He wanted your grandfather to
hand it to Prince Guang.

149
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,720
How is it yours

150
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,960
simply because you have it?

151
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,560
Unfortunately, I am a stubborn person.

152
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,560
It'd be great if I would hand it over.

153
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,560
But since you plan to take it from me,

154
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,960
not a chance.

155
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,720
Your Majesty.

156
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
After Qiu Ziliang's execution,

157
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
the Shencai Army became leaderless.

158
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
They are without a goal.

159
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,360
We should select a new General-in-Chief

160
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,720
as soon as possible.

161
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,840
This is the name list of people

162
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,640
we recommend.

163
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,360
Please have a look.

164
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,680
Your Majesty.

165
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,640
This is the name list.

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,840
Please have a look.

167
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,630
(Han Ding)

168
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,310
(Han Ding)

169
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,670
(Name list of Shencai Army soldiers)

170
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,680
Summon Hand Ding.

171
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,960
His Majesty wishes to have a word
with Han Ding.

172
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,720
I,

173
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,560
Han Ding,

174
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
greet Your Majesty.

175
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,200
Do you wish

176
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,720
to be the Shencai Army's
General-in-Chief?

177
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
You leave me with no choice.

178
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
My sister...

179
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,240
I designed the secret chamber.

180
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,560
I would surely know

181
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,720
if you modified it.

182
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,960
But I pity Miss Yanzhi.

183
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
She is already dead,

184
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
but she still can't have peace.

185
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
What is it that you want?

186
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
The same as always.

187
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Hand over the posthumous edict.

188
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,360
Then I'll leave,

189
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
and you can have her back.

190
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't make me do it.

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Ruoling.

192
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Fine.

193
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,160
My sister comes before anything.

194
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,690
(The heir shall be Prince Guang,
the thirteen prince.)

195
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,720
Great.

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
We're even now.

197
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,720
Let's go.

198
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,160
Sorry.

199
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,720
I miscalculated.

200
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
This isn't your fault.

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,560
The posthumous edict

202
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,200
was meant for Prince Guang anyway.

203
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
His Majesty told me something

204
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,119
I couldn't tell my sister.

205
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,599
She didn't know,

206
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,240
nor did Prince Guang.

207
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
Take my sister with you

208
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,359
and leave.

209
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,960
What about you?

210
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,480
Me?

211
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,080
I must carry out my duty
as the Sword Bearer.

212
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,320
Good.

213
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,440
You have my permission.

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,400
We are grateful for
Your Majesty's kindness.

215
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,680
Is there anything else to report?

216
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Make your reports quick and subtle.

217
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
Your Majesty,

218
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,520
that's all for now.

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Great.

220
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,360
Then dismiss.

221
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,760
We thank Your Majesty.

222
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
We shall be dismissed.

223
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,440
Uncle, please stay.

224
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,280
(Retirement letter)

225
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Uncle.

226
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Yu'er.

227
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,440
I thought you had gone home.

228
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,400
Why are you back again?

229
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,040
Yu'er.

230
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
It's not safe for you to be here.

231
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Come with me.

232
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,280
Uncle.

233
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,840
You know His Majesty needs help,

234
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,320
are you going to abandon him?

235
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,520
Do you think I would rather leave?

236
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,320
His Majesty asked me to leave.

237
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,720
He said

238
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
I would only be a liability

239
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,960
if I stayed.

240
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,120
The master treated me with kindness,

241
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
I shall repay him with my loyalty.

242
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Uncle.

243
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,840
Stay.

244
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's help him together.

245
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Uncle, do you know

246
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,200
why I asked you to stay?

247
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,650
(Name list of Shencai Army soldiers)

248
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,280
The names of the people

249
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
I ordered Han Ding to assign to
the Shencai Army

250
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,280
(Name list of Shencai Army soldiers)

251
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,080
are on this list.

252
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,400
But I have never

253
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
promised them

254
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
any benefit.

255
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,280
Was it your doing?

256
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
The Chess of Generals

257
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,600
and Qiu Ziliang's confidants

258
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,000
have been removed by Yanzhi.

259
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
Yanzhi's only confidant

260
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,600
was Yan Xiu.

261
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
The rest of them

262
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
were your men.

263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,120
As for the Violet Bureau,

264
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
if Cheng Ruoyu doesn't return,

265
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,920
it won't change the fact
that Madam Jade works for you.

266
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,090
(Name list of Shencai Army soldiers)

267
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
I thought

268
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,040
removing Qiu Ziliang

269
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,560
would disperse this corruption

270
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,800
and pave the way to a better future.

271
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
But I never thought

272
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,480
there was a man just as evil as he was.

273
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Your secret has been compromised.

274
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,920
Uncle.

275
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,720
Why not come clean while you can?

276
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
How dare you

277
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,800
block my way?

278
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,880
Prince Guang and His Majesty

279
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,960
are discussing important affairs.

280
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,560
I shall inform them.

281
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
Who do you think you are?

282
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,160
The Grand Empress Dowager is here.

283
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.

284
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Official Zhang.

285
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
Official Chen.

286
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,040
Why...

287
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,480
This is great.

288
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,960
With the Grand Empress Dowager
as our witness,

289
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,560
let's finish the procedures

290
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,200
from years ago.

291
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,680
Bring it here.

292
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
Guards!

293
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,640
Your Honor,

294
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,960
it's been nine years

295
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,200
since I rose to the throne.

296
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,560
I was enraged by my disgrace.

297
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,880
It's my goal to rid the world of evil.

298
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,000
But the eunuchs seized the power
of the throne

299
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
and was out of control.

300
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,560
Morning Dew Rebellion's failure

301
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
caused great harm to my loyalists.

302
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,840
The true cause was my negligence.

303
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,560
I swear to bring down
the disgraceful Qiu Ziliang with me.

304
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,120
But I am worried that Daxing's

305
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
will face a power vacancy.

306
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,600
But fortunately, my uncle Prince Guang
is a man of great wisdom and vision.

307
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
He has experienced hardship.

308
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,920
He carries to become a wise ruler.

309
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,640
I shall pass my throne to Prince Guang.

310
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,600
With the duty bestowed upon
by the seven ancestral shrines

311
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,400
and the duty entrusted by the four seas,

312
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,160
this edict shall be carried out
by the administration.

313
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,000
The 9th year of Tai'an,

314
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
November 21st.

315
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,840
This is the posthumous edict
from the Late Emperor.

316
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,440
All we lack is the signature
and verification from the Chancellery.

317
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,040
I question the authenticity
of this posthumous edict.

318
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,730
(The 9th year of Tai'an, November 21st)

319
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,000
Grand Empress Dowager.

320
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,640
Grand Empress Dowager!

321
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,400
Grand Empress Dowager.

322
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,440
Grand Empress Dowager.

323
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Grand Empress Dowager,
have a closer look.

324
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
Since the Grand Empress Dowager

325
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,120
has validated the edict,

326
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,280
gentlemen,

327
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,720
please give me your signatures.

328
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,610
(The 9th year of Tai'an, November 21st)

329
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,760
I see.

330
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
You've been waiting.

331
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
After the Morning Dew Rebellion,

332
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,240
my brother wrote the posthumous edict

333
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,960
to pass the throne to you.

334
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,080
But there wasn't enough time.

335
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,920
The Chancellery didn't sign the edict.

336
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
I was wrong.

337
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,360
I was so wrong.

338
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
I shouldn't have thought of you

339
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
as Qiu Ziliang's reflection.

340
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,240
That old fox doesn't deserve the honor.

341
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,240
Qiu Ziliang seized control
of the Imperial Court.

342
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,840
Hence, he was loathed by the world.

343
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,560
He's nothing compared to you.

344
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Uncle.

345
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,240
You are a righteous person

346
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
whose name is sung by the people.

347
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,640
Do you think

348
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,120
I've let you down?

349
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,320
Do you think I took your throne?

350
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,680
I used to think so.

351
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,160
"Used to?"

352
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,840
But it doesn't matter now.

353
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,440
Agreed.

354
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,840
It doesn't matter now.

355
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,120
It's of very little significance.

356
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
Uncle,

357
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,120
that's because you could

358
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
succeed the throne

359
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,080
righteously and peacefully

360
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,880
That will make me

361
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,440
nothing more than a usurper.

362
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,040
Your Majesty!

363
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,560
Your Majesty.

364
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,560
Your Majesty.

365
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,480
Uncle.

366
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,160
It's unnecessary

367
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,680
to act as if you care about me.

368
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,000
(Supervising Secretary)

369
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,520
You made a wise decision.

370
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
The new Emperor will reward you

371
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,760
for your contribution.

372
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,640
I am Vice Director of
Secretariat Luo Mian.

373
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
I checked the posthumous edict

374
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
and confirmed its authenticity.

375
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,000
Therefore, I gave my signature.

376
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,160
However,

377
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,600
I am sitting in this position today

378
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,440
because His Majesty promoted me.

379
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,320
I failed to uphold my loyalty.

380
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,240
I gained His Majesty's favor
but couldn't uphold my loyalty.

381
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
I am

382
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
ashamed of myself.

383
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,680
We feel ashamed.

384
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,320
I see.

385
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,600
I wasn't entirely worthless.

386
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,680
There are some people

387
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,800
that can't be bought off.

388
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,920
Uncle.

389
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Only the winner is ever righteous.

390
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,400
I lost.

391
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,560
It's an undeniable defeat.

392
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,920
But I

393
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,760
need a favor from you.

394
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,880
Release the backbone of our nation.

395
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,480
Let them live.

396
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,600
I beg of you.

397
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,120
Yuan Zhi!

398
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,440
Come in.

399
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
Grand Empress Dowager, please come in.

400
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,400
Yu'er.

401
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,520
It's a critical moment for Your Majesty.

402
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
As your Sword Bearer,

403
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,480
I must be present by your side.

404
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,040
Cheng Ruoyu, oh Cheng Ruoyu.

405
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,680
You have no idea how to cherish

406
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
your sister's effort.

407
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,600
I beg to differ.

408
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,680
I came here because

409
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
I don't want her effort

410
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,040
to be in vain.

411
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,920
Prince Guang.

412
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
For as long as I can remember,

413
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,760
you are the person I respect

414
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,440
the most.

415
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
But today,

416
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,480
your crimes and actions

417
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
have let me down.

418
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,240
You are despicable.

419
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,520
You're mistaken.

420
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,160
I'll show you what it means

421
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,800
to restore order

422
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
and end the chaos.

423
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,560
The posthumous edict is right here.

424
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,840
I have read it to the officials.

425
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
The Grand Empress Dowager
has verified its authenticity.

426
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,960
The officials have given
their signatures.

427
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,159
Your Highness, please accept the edict.

428
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,040
This is unnecessary, Uncle.

429
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,880
Even without the posthumous edict,

430
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,920
the throne

431
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,080
will still be yours.

432
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
I don't want it.

433
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
You don't want it?

434
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,280
Of course.

435
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,200
The throne was yours

436
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,480
all along.

437
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,080
But I

438
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
was nothing but a usurper.

439
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
I have no right

440
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,840
to give it to you as mine.

441
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,680
Am I wrong?

442
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,920
When I was little,

443
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,320
I had often dreamed

444
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,320
that I was riding a dragon in the sky.

445
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,720
I told my mother about the dream.

446
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,680
She told me

447
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,600
not to let another soul know.

448
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,480
Otherwise,

449
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,800
I would be in grave danger.

450
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
Even as a child,

451
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,320
you had planned to seize the throne.

452
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,480
When I was little,

453
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,600
I fell ill.

454
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,440
I was lying in my bed

455
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,640
and barely conscious.

456
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,920
Then a ray of light

457
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,600
shined upon me.

458
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,800
I jumped up

459
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,400
and greeted it,

460
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,960
as if I were an Emperor
who was greeting his officers.

461
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,120
My mother was scared speechless.

462
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,440
That's because

463
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,280
my brother saw it.

464
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,600
But my brother wasn't mad at me.

465
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,760
He touched my back

466
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
and talked to me with a smile.

467
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,400
"Brother,

468
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,480
you are truly..."

469
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
"The prodigy of our family."

470
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
I have forgotten the dreams I had

471
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,840
as a child.

472
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,280
But those words

473
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,160
have never left my memory.

474
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,560
But our late father

475
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,640
loved you the most.

476
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
The royalty is a family of cruelty.

477
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
It's especially so for the sons
of the Qi family.

478
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
To seize the throne,

479
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
parents were killed or exiled,

480
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,240
siblings fought in
countless power struggles.

481
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,720
The ambition for great power

482
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,920
flows in our veins.

483
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,760
It makes us restless all the time.

484
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
Do I want to be the Emperor?

485
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes.

486
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
Did I have the opportunity?

487
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,560
Sure.

488
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,680
You finally admitted it.

489
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,080
Right Minister "Thirteen" of
the Chess of Generals Camp

490
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,320
was my double.

491
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,040
I had numerous chances

492
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,840
to take your life
with Qiu Ziliang's hands.

493
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,160
I had discovered
Zheng Wu's background long ago.

494
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,200
I had plenty of chances

495
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
to expose her.

496
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,040
The royal retainers of Zhenwu
escorted Ninghe back to the Capital.

497
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,480
Han Yue

498
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,160
was devoted to accomplish

499
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
the Late Emperor's dying wish

500
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,800
and help me seize the throne.

501
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,320
Cheng Xi was

502
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,920
my elder sister from a different father.

503
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,360
As for Yanzhi...

504
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,520
was the descendant
of my old acquaintance.

505
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
You had been using my sister

506
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,720
all this time.

507
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,120
You used her for your revenge.

508
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,560
You used her to get rid of Qiu Ziliang

509
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,880
so you could command the Camp,

510
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,200
you tricked her into thinking

511
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,280
you felt guilty
for the Wang family's fate,

512
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
that you wanted revenge!

513
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,440
As for Your Majesty,

514
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,440
you were at death's doorstep many times.

515
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
You wanted me to succeed the throne.

516
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,720
All the stars were aligned.

517
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,600
I have many chances

518
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
to get what I had always pursued.

519
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,520
But I

520
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,200
refused it.

521
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,680
The Dragon Throne is here.

522
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I can sit on it.

523
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,240
And if I do,

524
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,200
that is my power.

525
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,040
I can sit on it.

526
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,680
And if I refuse to sit on it,

527
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
that's morality.

528
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,160
It's easy to give in to power.

529
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,480
But dying for morality
is a tough decision.

530
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,360
It was the same as my brother.

531
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,000
He could have taken my life.

532
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,640
He could have easily punished me

533
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,320
for my crime of treason.

534
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,400
But he didn't do it.

535
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,200
He smiled and

536
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,640
praised me.

537
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,840
Your Majesty.

538
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,520
Don't you think

539
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,480
the emperors are heartless and
the royal family is without compassion?

540
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,320
But I...

541
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,400
No!

542
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,200
No matter how low I stoop,

543
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,280
I will never hurt

544
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
my own family.

545
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,640
Not to mention

546
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,000
you are my brother's son.

547
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,400
You are my nephew.

548
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Your Highness.

549
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,800
Shut it.

550
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
We had planned for years.

551
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,560
But...

552
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,120
Shut it.

553
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,840
Your Highness!

554
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,800
Scram!

555
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,800
Your Majesty.

556
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,320
There is something

557
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,960
that I had brought up many times
in the past.

558
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,960
Now,

559
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
I'll say it one last time.

560
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,000
You will always be my Emperor.

561
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,200
Uncle.

562
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,000
Uncle.

563
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,760
Sir.

564
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,480
I was ordered by His Majesty

565
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,520
to summon you.

566
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,200
Who let her in?

567
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,880
His Majesty will see to it.

568
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,400
