Qiu Yanzhi!

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
She knew it was me.

16
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,400
No.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
I must inform Eunuch Qiu.

18
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,880
(Zuo Ma)

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,600
No.

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
I don't have solid evidence.

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
Eunuch Qiu will never
take my words for it.

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,600
Ru Feng?

23
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
(You are still here.)

24
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Leave the horse here.

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,480
You might need it for an emergency.

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Leaving it here?

27
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
Will it be all right?

28
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
Its name is Ru Feng.

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,640
It's intelligent.

30
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
Ride it, and you will know.

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Yes.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
(Thanks, Your Majesty.)

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
Ru Feng the gorgeous mare.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600

No.

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,760
Keep searching.

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,560

Check the other area.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,880
Check that area.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
On my way.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
How did you hurt your hand?

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
It's a long story.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,640
You are the New Sword Bearer
of Violet Bureau.

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,960
Who are you?

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,360
How do you know me?

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm from Chess of Generals Camp.

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course I know you.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
You're from the Camp?

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
So why are they after you?

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
Isn't it obvious?

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
To make sure

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
I die.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Come with me.

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
I'll get you out of this forest.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Get on the horse.

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,760
I appreciate your help.

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
We are strangers to each other.

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
It's best to go our separate ways.

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Over there! Pursue!

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,040
Arrest him!

80
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
Halt.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,480
There is nowhere to run now.

82
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,870
(Chess of Generals Camp)

83
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,120
What were you running from?

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
I touched something I shouldn't have.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
I felt guilty.

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,280
So I started running.

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
If you knew,

88
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,920
why did you do it?

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Out of curiosity.

90
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
You're a man of curiosity.

91
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
But you're always cautious.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
You broke into my room

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
and touched my belonging.

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,120
You took this great risk

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
because you seek to have

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,040
something of greater value.

97
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,320
Come clean.

98
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
What was it that you seek?

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Guards.

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,800
Chess Overseer.

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,560
I want Master Zuo Ma's

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
schedule for the past few months

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,160
reported to me.

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,560
Yes.

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,320
March 1st,

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Master Zuo Ma left Heng'an.

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,280
He headed to the west

108
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,880
and returned to Heng'an
after half a month.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
He stayed for ten days.

110
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,200
He went to Nanling Mountains afterward.

111
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
The Nanling Mountains?

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
You were investigating me.

113
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
He remained there for days

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,760
before he went to Shangzhou,

115
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,760
Yuezhou,

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,760
Xuzhou,

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,920
Duanzhou,

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,840
and Liaozibu.

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
He then returned to Heng'an

120
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,760
and stayed in Nanling Mountains
for three days

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
before returning to the Capital.

122
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
So he really was investigating me.

123
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
It seems like

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
you're getting anxious.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,480
What's wrong?

126
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Do you feel fear when he mentioned
Shangzhou, Xuzhou,

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,480
and Yuezhou?

128
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
Dismissed.

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,080
Yes.

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
What have you found?

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,440
Qiu Yanzhi.

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,520
Da Ya was the real name.

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,080
Born on March 8th of the first year
of the Baoli Era,

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,400
and grew up in Nanling Mountains
of Heng'an's suburb.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
What is this?

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
His Majesty must have left this.

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,440
I should put it back.

138
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
Because of famine,

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,159
the villagers lost their homes.

140
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,720
A total of 19 young girls went missing.

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,640
I followed these clues

142
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
to those places

143
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,840
over time.

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
I verified the whereabouts

145
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,920
of those 19 girls.

146
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,280
Do you know

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
what I found?

148
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Of the 19 girls I investigated,

149
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,480
no one matched

150
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,520
your description.

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Qiu Yanzhi,

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,800
your identity and account

153
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,440
are all fake.

154
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Is that all?

155
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,760
Before you were sold
into the Music Hall,

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
you once spent a night

157
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
at Zhang Zi Herb Store.

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
According to the staff there,

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
you were heavily wounded.

160
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,000
There was a large wound on your chest.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
That means

162
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,000
Your heart meridian

163
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
was already destroyed

164
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
before entering the Camp.

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
It wasn't because of my attack!

166
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
And because of your

167
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
old injury,

168
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Eunuch Qiu thought it was

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,960
my fault you couldn't
practice martial art.

170
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Haven't you heard?

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
I had to clean toilets

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
for three years as my punishment!

173
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,840
Three years!

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,640
And then?

175
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
What do you mean?

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
And then...

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,080
I set you up.

178
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
You lost while competing against me

179
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,840
for the title I now have.

180
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,080
You also found

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,200
other evidence

182
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,000
to prove that I am not
the real Qiu Yanzhi,

183
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
that I am merely a wanderer.

184
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,400
Do you really expect to succeed?

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,240
Whether I will succeed

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
depends on the new Sword Bearer

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
of the Violet Bureau.

188
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,280
What was that?

189
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
I've told Cheng Ruoyu

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,760
everything I've found.

191
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,440
You went to the palace.

192
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,320
No.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,440
Isn't it odd?

194
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
I actually ran into her

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
in the forest.

196
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,040
This must be my fate!

197
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,880
My fate told me

198
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
it was better to let her
have the evidence

199
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
than to let Eunuch Qiu have it.

200
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
As of this moment,

201
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
His Majesty wants to break free

202
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,000
from Eunuch Qiu's control.

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,920
The Violet Bureau possesses

204
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,280
your dirty little secret.

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,400
So,

206
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
what will they do next?

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,480
Qiu Yanzhi, oh Qiu Yanzhi.

208
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,400
You painstakingly forged
this false identity of yours,

209
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,040
but what is it

210
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,800
that you want to achieve?

211
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Take him away.

212
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,600
Lock him up.

213
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes.

214
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,880
Guards!

215
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Qiu Yanzhi!

216
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,480
You are doomed!

217
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
Let go of me!

218
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,120
(Ziyun Sanctum)

219
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
(A grand abode for a sage.)

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,560
(Ru Feng.)

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
(Wait here.)

222
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,800
(I need to know if they are
great warriors.)

223
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,760
(I'll show the sword
if I can't beat them.)

224
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
(This must be the place.)

225
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,560
(What are they doing?)

226
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,200
(Yuzhen Hall, Ziyuan)

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,650
(Leader of Yuzhen Hall, Madam Jade)

228
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,400
All hail the Hall Leader.

229
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,920
All hail the Hall Leader.

230
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,120
Whoever seizes the token

231
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,040
wins.

232
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Yes.

233
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,960
Halt!

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,360
So,

235
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
who are you?

236
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm the Sword Bearer

237
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,200
of the Violet Bureau.

238
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
The Qingguang Sword.

239
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,600
Who exactly are you?

240
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
My name is Cheng Ruoyu.

241
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I am Cheng Xi's niece.

242
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,840
From now on,

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm taking over the Yuzhen Hall.

244
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,760
Those who lost

245
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,840
must be punished.

246
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,600
Stop!

247
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
What are you doing?

248
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,960
It's our daily training.

249
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Those who lost must be punished.

250
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,360
From now on, that rule is abolished.

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
You don't get to decide.

252
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,400
I don't get to decide?

253
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,160
Does my Qingguang Sword
have the right to decide?

254
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,680
Of course it does.

255
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,800
But do you deserve

256
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,760
to wield this sword?

257
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Very well.

258
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,840
I'll show you whether

259
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm qualified to wield this sword.

260
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,640
Where is Cheng Ruoyu?

261
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
She's not in the palace.

262
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,040
It seems like

263
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,600
Zuo Ma wasn't lying.

264
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,120
He did run into her

265
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,040
in the forest

266
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,320
and handed her the evidence.

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,160
Keep looking.

268
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,120
(Ziyun Sanctum)

269
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,450
(Ziyun Sanctum)

270
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,280
Are you really Madam Cheng's niece?

271
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,590
(Ziyun Sanctum)

272
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,839
Did you steal the sword?

273
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,000
They say the essence
of the Violet Bureau

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,119
is in the Yuzhen Hall.

275
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
The rest are all worthless fools.

276
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Hall Leader.

277
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,800
The saying proves to be true.

278
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
Do you know...

279
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
why you failed to command us

280
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
despite wielding the Qingguang Sword?

281
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,080
Why?

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,080
The first rule of the Yuzhen Hall:

283
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
Respect for the strongest.

284
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
You saw our training just now.

285
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
We do it on a daily basis.

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Every month

287
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
we rank them by the tokens they get.

288
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,720
Whoever gets the most tokens

289
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,480
will be the Hall Leader
in the next month.

290
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
If you wish to command us,

291
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,280
then take the token from us.

292
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,970
(Ziyun Sanctum)

293
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
Up ahead! Pursue!

294
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,520
Stop right there!

295
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Capture her! Now!

296
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,000
Over there!

297
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,720
After her!

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,880
Stop!

299
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,400
Stop running!

300
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,880
Get her!

301
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,680
Over there!

302
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,000
Pursue!

303
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,720
No!

304
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
(If the Chess of Generals Camp
captures her...)

305
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,760
(No.)

306
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,600
(I must figure out a way)

307
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,080
(to keep her safe.)

308
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,120
Uncle.

309
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Uncle?

310
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,240
Qi Yan?

311
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,640
Your Majesty!

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,040
Your Majesty, my apology.

313
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,880
I deserve punishment.

314
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Uncle.

315
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,400
When I was little,

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,560
you've always addressed me that way.

317
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,720
Your Majesty remembers.

318
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Your Majesty must have come

319
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,000
for an important matter.

320
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,240
Yuan Du is a formidable warrior.

321
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,280
I wish to invite him to Mount Qi

322
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,320
to keep Cheng Ruoyu safe.

323
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,680
Yu'er is on Mount Qi?

324
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,500
(Ziyun Sanctum)

325
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Let's go.

326
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,800
(Ziyun Sanctum)

327
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,080
Greetings, Chess Overseer.

328
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I was told the Sword Bearer

329
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,320
has been grounded by His Majesty.

330
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
Yes.

331
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,360
Poor thing.

332
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,000
I should cheer her up.

333
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
That wouldn't be necessary,
Chess Overseer.

334
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,560
I think

335
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,080
she got what she deserved.

336
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,760
I should still visit her.

337
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,200
People can change in a matter of days.

338
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,160
I didn't see her

339
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,600
while I was sick.

340
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,400
Chess Overseer! Chess Overseer!

341
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Chess Overseer!

342
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,480
No.

343
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
They are too ferocious.

344
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,120
I have no chance of winning.

345
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,640
Who's there?

346
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
You are no match for them

347
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,040
if your only goal

348
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,560
is to secure the command token.

349
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,920
You...

350
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,880
You work for Prince Guang.

351
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,640
My name is Yuan Du.

352
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,640
Greetings, Sword Bearer.

353
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,960
Why are you here?

354
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Prince Guang wants you to have these.

355
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
Please open them based on the order

356
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,880
of your name.

357
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
The fish over the Dragon's Gate.

358
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,760
Fishing on the freezing ice.

359
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,120
Children debating over
the Sun's distance.

360
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
Does Prince Guang want me
to have these?

361
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,520
(Ninth Heaven Mystic Maiden Formation)

362
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,920
Are you can see,

363
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,840
the whole place is a formation

364
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,840
when you see it from above.

365
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Madam Cheng spends years

366
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,000
training them

367
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,080
not just to make them

368
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,200
compete over a token.

369
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,960
They operate

370
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,320
according to their formation.

371
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,880
To defeat them,

372
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
I must break the formation.

373
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,440
Are you going in now?

374
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,040
Do you remember the plan to break it?

375
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
I remember the method.

376
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,600
As for the rest,

377
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,840
I must rely on my muscle memory.

378
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,620
(Ziyun Sanctum)

379
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,040
All hail the Chess Overseer.

380
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,350
(Chess of Generals Camp)

381
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,840
Congratulations, you are now
officially Pawns.

382
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Anyone of you

383
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,360
may replace the Gold Chess Piece

384
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,040
as long as they are strong enough.

385
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
You may even

386
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
replace me.

387
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,920
Now

388
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,840
I have a mission for you.

389
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
Go to Mount Qi

390
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
and capture Cheng Ruoyu

391
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,760
and the 300 warriors of sacrifice
from Yuzhen Hall!

392
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,880
Yes.

393
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I got it.

394
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,960
Securing a token

395
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,240
is still a victory.

396
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,480
She is exhausted.

397
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
Give her a room so she could rest.

398
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Don't worry.

399
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,000
You did very well.

400
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
But Prince Guang

401
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,280
taught her how to break your formation.

402
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,200
All right.

403
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,840
You are gifted.

404
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,120
It's amazing that you broke it

405
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,600
so quickly.

406
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
I have Prince Guang to thank.

407
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
He wrote in detail

408
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
about the formation's shift.

409
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,360
However,

410
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
I practiced the whole night

411
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,440
and failed to wrap my head around it.

412
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,120
They've trained for years.

413
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,440
You defeated them after one night.

414
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,880
It was a remarkable feat.

415
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
Well, I am a genius

416
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,320
and also a self-demanding person.

417
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,520
However,

418
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,000
you just ran out of time.

419
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,640
You must return to the palace tomorrow.

420
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,720
What do you mean?

421
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,400
I haven't made them bow down to me.

422
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
I didn't tell you because

423
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,960
I didn't want to distract you.

424
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,760
The Pawns of the Camp

425
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
are already on their way here.

426
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I eliminated

427
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,600
the first wave,

428
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,760
but it won't take long

429
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,520
until more of them come.

430
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,600
But...

431
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm not sure

432
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,280
I could convince the Hall Leader
to follow my lead.

433
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
A prescription.

434
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,680
What is this for?

435
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,240
Didn't you notice something odd

436
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,320
about the Hall Leader?

437
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
You mean the way she never talked.

438
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
A throat sickness.

439
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,200
This is a prescription
for her condition.

440
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,120
(Boil with water and remove the waste,
take the medicine regularly.)

441
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,400
Is this your prescription?

442
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,800
Of course not.

443
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,560
I got it

444
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,120
from a masterful physician.

445
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,320
How do you know

446
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,400
our Hall Leader is carrying an injury?

447
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,960
How do you know the way to treat it?

448
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,600
Well...

449
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,920
Hall Leader,

450
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,760
just try it out.

451
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
It might actually work.

452
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,640
Hall Leader.

453
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
This prescription is suspicious.

454
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,080
We must not trust it.

455
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,880
How is it suspicious?

456
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm Madam Cheng's niece.

457
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,400
I wish to lead you to

458
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,160
protect His Majesty

459
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,360
and work as one.

460
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,360
You only got one token.

461
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,080
You have a long way to go
before leading us.

462
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Hall Leader.

463
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,600
Hall Leader, no.

464
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,800
She is not worthy of it.

465
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,640
Thanks, Hall Leader.

466
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,960
All hail the Sword Bearer!

467
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,680
This is odd.

468
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
There is nothing

469
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
in the third pouch.

470
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,720
Two children debating
over Sun's distance...

471
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,040
What does it mean?

472
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,400
What's going on?

473
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,880
Why did you sound
the withdrawal alarm?

474
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,640
I checked outside.

475
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
The Pawns have reached the mountainside.

476
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,360
This place is compromised.

477
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,880
You must retreat to Jinyang at once.

478
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,400
Blend into Princess Ninghe's

479
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,960
troops.

480
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,760
Wait for further orders.

481
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,760
Miss Yu'er.

482
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,240
You must return to the palace.

483
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,240
Let's go.

484
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,800
Come with me.

485
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,640
What are you doing?

486
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,480
We need to go!

487
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,480
Leave them be.

488
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
You must leave.

489
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,280
This is bad.

490
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,040
Soldiers are coming.

491
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,160
I'll distract them.

492
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,200
Leave with Ru Feng.

493
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,920
But...

494
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,250
(Qiu)

495
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,080
The Chess of Generals Camp.

496
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,760
Yes.

497
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,720
It must be Qiu Yanzhi from the Camp.

498
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
We'll fight them off.

499
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
You are wounded. Go without me.

500
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,440
What about you?

501
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,600
I can handle them.

502
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
Don't take the risk.

503
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,200
Stop talking. Just go!

504
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Cheng Ruoyu.

505
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,640
You never cease to surprise us.

506
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,680
Scoundrel.

507
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,280
Don't be so harsh.

508
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,680
You were too nosy

509
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,160
and compromised their location.

510
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,280
Get to the point.

511
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,680
Why are you following me?

512
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,600
I told you.

513
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,080
The Violet Bureau and the Yuzhen Hall

514
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,520
are not my targets.

515
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
For the time being,

516
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,800
we can co-exist in harmony.

517
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,080
You made it sound so pleasant.

518
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
But your actions showed me

519
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,880
how untrustworthy you are.

520
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,560
We could still negotiate.

521
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,920
About what?

522
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
Let's make a deal.

523
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,840
What deal?

524
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,040
Hand over the thing

525
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,760
Zuo Ma gave you.

526
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,760
Zuo Ma?

527
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,240
He's the man you saved

528
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
in the forest.

529
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,960
He gave me nothing.

530
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,200
Are you sure?

531
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,560
I am certain of it.

532
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,080
Yu'er.

533
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,360
We are not enemies.

534
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,520
I said, he gave me nothing.

535
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Perhaps...

536
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
you would like to frisk me.

537
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,560
On the horse back.

538
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Yan Xiu.

539
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,440
Inform the others.

540
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,960
Capture the woman who got away.

541
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Yes.

542
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
Pursue the horse from earlier.

543
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,360
Yes!

544
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,360
Qiu Yanzhi, what are you up to?

545
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Give it back.

546
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
Otherwise, I'll hand over
the warriors of Yuzhen Hall

547
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,360
to my father.

548
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,560
You should know very well

549
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,120
what he'll do to them.

550
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,360
Qiu Yanzhi.

551
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,160
How cruel can you be?

552
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,320
I appreciate the compliment.

553
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,960
Chess Overseer!

554
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,480
There is no one in the Ziyun Sanctum.

555
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,360
We've failed you.

556
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,720
Please punish us as you see fit.

557
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,040
Dismissed.

558
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,400
It seems like

559
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,440
I must drag you back

560
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,120
and hand you over to Duke Chu.

561
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
Let's see

562
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,400
if you could capture me.

563
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,080
Your Majesty!

564
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,480
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

565
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,480
What do you plan to do

566
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,160
with my Sword Bearer?

567
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
I wouldn't dare to hurt her.

568
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,920
It was a misunderstanding.

569
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,280
My apologies, Your Majesty.

570
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,440
A misunderstanding?

571
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,280
How are you?

572
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
I'm safe and sound.

573
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,400
Get on the horse.

574
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,080
Which horse?

575
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,240
My horse.

576
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,120
Yes.

577
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
We deployed many soldiers.

578
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,760
Eunuch Qiu will find out.

579
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,160
We need a sound explanation for him.

580
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Before that,

581
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,720
we should check on Zuo Ma.

582
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,320
What brought

583
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,360
Your Majesty here?

584
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,320
You hadn't returned,

585
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,520
so I must see to it myself.

586
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,600
Can't you get anything done?

587
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
You're worthless.

588
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,160
I appreciate the aid.

589
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
Don't get it wrong, Cheng Ruoyu.

590
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,760
I came out for hunting.

591
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,600
But I ran into you.

592
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,960
So I'm taking you back.

593
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes.

594
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,320
I knew there would be an excuse.

595
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,440
By the way, did Your Majesty

596
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,840
save those people

597
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,800
from the Yuzhen Hall?

598
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Your Majesty.

599
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,400
I'm glad you're here.

600
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,600
Your Majesty.

601
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,720
It's Ru feng.

602
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
I, Xia Ziyuan,
am at Your Majesty's service.

603
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,320
Long live Your Majesty.

604
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,960
Xia Ziyuan.

605
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,840
Yes.

606
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,840
Your Majesty,

607
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,400
you know her?

608
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,360
How did the white horse perform?

609
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,560
Your Majesty has the best horses.

610
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,640
Back to the palace.

611
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,680
(So Ru Feng is His Majesty's horse.)

612
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,120
What?

613
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Have you decided on how to kill me?

614
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,080
I saw the thing

615
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,560
you gave Cheng Ruoyu.

616
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,280
That won't be enough

617
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,240
to bring me down.

618
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,760
I thought it would be more intriguing

619
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,960
because you risked your life
to secure it.

620
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,920
What do you mean?

621
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,640
You may go now.

622
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,080
I await

623
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,320
your next challenge.

624
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,120
Qiu Yanzhi!

625
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,080
Qiu Yanzhi!

626
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,000
Qiu Yanzhi!

627
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,280
Qiu Yanzhi!

628
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,240
Be gentle.

629
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:34,392
Do you know what you're doing?

630
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,760
Just bear with it.

631
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,000
Stop whining.

632
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,200
This is your fault.

633
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,480
Had you not dragged me

634
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,520
with you...

635
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,680
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

636
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,800
Sit down.

637
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,920
- Much obliged.
- Much obliged.

638
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,520
So,

639
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,480
what's going on?

640
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,400
We should thank Prince Guang.

641
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,000
Otherwise, my trip there
would be in vain.

642
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,720
Fish over the Dragon Gate;

643
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
It helped you break the formation.

644
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
Fishing on the ice;

645
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,160
For you to give aid.

646
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
But the children debating
the Sun's distance...

647
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,040
What does it mean?

648
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,240
Her.

649
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,000
What does it have to do with me?

650
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,360
Your Majesty,

651
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,440
he won't follow my order.

652
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,920
So I took her with me.

653
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,240
I'll convince her with
Your Majesty's wrath.

654
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,120
Is that what it means?

655
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,400
I think it worked.

656
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,400
Ziyuan.

657
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,800
Will you follow me now?

658
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,920
In that case,

659
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,040
let her stay by your side.

660
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,520
Those from Yuzhen Hall

661
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,680
have set out for Jinyang.

662
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,320
You need a messenger

663
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,520
to communicate with them.

664
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,280
Yes.

665
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,560
I had the same idea.

666
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,480
All right.

667
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,680
It's getting late.

668
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,120
Rest well.

669
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,960
Yes.
