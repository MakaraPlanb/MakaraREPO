=Episode 21=

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,920
The new Right Chariot
has arrived in Lucong.

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,800
According to him,

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,480
the hidden sentry's report was true.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,360
The situation in Lucong is escalating.

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
What is it?

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,480
I have failed you.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
Li Deyun

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
has arrived in Heng'an.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
The two Cannons were killed last month.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Li Deyun must have

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
set out during that time.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,240
I only realized that yesterday.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
It's too late to
intercept his carriage now.

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
We even fell for a decoy

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,080
earlier today.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
Li Deyun

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,039
might have met His Majesty.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
I know that.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
I have just reported

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
to Duke Chu.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,360
The Right Minister

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
wants him

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
to come here.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
It's better to monitor
his movement while we can.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,920
Father, do you agree with this plan?

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,840
The Li family from the Zhao prefecture
are known for their achievements.

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,280
The descendants are
all over the imperial court.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,360
Li Deyun wasn't

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,400
a low-rank officer.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,480
He is not the kind of target
you could simply strike down.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
This is a desperate time.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,120
Since he's been summoned,

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,960
let him live for a while.

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,120
Yes.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,720
Regarding the rebellion in Lucong,

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,520
has my fellow officers

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,720
come up with a solution?

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,960
General Wang.

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,360
I wish I could be there,

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,400
but my body is too weak.

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,040
I could barely ride on horseback
to be in a hunting party.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
General Zhong.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm willing to go.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,240
However,

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
my mother is already

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,520
80 years old.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,840
She is bedridden and
unable to care for herself.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,160
I have failed as a son!

64
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,760
Your Majesty.

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm willing to set out for Lucong.

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Yu'er.

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
What is this nonsense?

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Stop fooling around.

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,800
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I know martial arts.

71
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,079
I am willing to lead
the soldiers to Lucong

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,480
to end the turmoils

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
so the people can have peace again.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
You know martial arts,

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,920
but you don't know war!

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
Do you even know any tactics?

77
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,200
I do not know,

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
but I am willing to learn.

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,800
Not to mention

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
my body is strong

81
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,760
and I have no parents to look after.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
I am quite certain
I am the better choice

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
compared to the two officers.

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
This is the Imperial Court!

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
A mere woman has no place

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,760
in the war effort!

87
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,440
I was directly appointed by His Majesty

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,880
as an Upper Rank Five officer.

89
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,800
Why can't I volunteer
for the war effort?

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Do not be disrespectful to General Wang.

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Yes.

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Your Majesty.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,840
I think

94
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
the Sword Bearer

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
hasn't earned the right to be
on the battlefield.

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
Duke Chu.

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
From your perspective,

98
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
am I

99
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,600
worthy of leading the soldiers?

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,760
Brother Li.

101
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,840
It's been too long.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
You still look young as always.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Indeed, Official Li.

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,440
It's a pleasure to meet you.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,520
You're back.

106
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,400
Welcome, Official Li.

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,080
Welcome back.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
I'm glad you're back.

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,680
Officers.

110
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,080
It's good to have you back.

111
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Officers.

112
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,600
Thank you.

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,840
Your Majesty.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,960
I, Li Deyun,

115
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
have returned upon being summoned

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
to serve Your Majesty.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,920
Long live Your Majesty.

118
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,880
At ease, Official Li.

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Much thanks, Your Majesty.

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,400
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,440
I was told Chen Yintai

122
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
killed Military Commissioner
Shi Quanzhong

123
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,040
in an attempt to seize control
of the Imperial Court

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
and take command of the army.

125
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,160
When I was escorting Princess Ninghe

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
to Lucong for her wedding,

127
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,720
I had met

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Chen Yintai.

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,720
I am willing to set out for Lucong

130
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
and end the rebellion.

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,680
Duke Chu.

132
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
What do you think?

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,480
Official Li.

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,680
You just took over

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
this hot potato.

136
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,640
This is the best I could ask for.

137
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,360
However,

138
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,080
we must end the rebellion in Lucong.

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,200
If the war spread any further,

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
people will suffer.

141
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Not to mention the other
military commissioners

142
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,080
are waiting for a chance
to rebel against us.

143
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,520
Official Li.

144
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
How long will it take?

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
Three months.

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,920
This is an urgent situation.

147
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
Three months are too long.

148
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,000
Get it done in a month.

149
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
Two months.

150
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,480
I think two months are more than enough.

151
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Very well.

152
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
That settles it.

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,000
However,

154
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
I must warn you.

155
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,400
If you failed

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
to end the Lucong rebellion

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,640
in two months,

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,400
how should we proceed?

159
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
I believe

160
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Official Li

161
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,040
will not disappoint me.

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
If he failed...

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
If I failed,

164
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,840
I will hand in my resignation

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
and become a mere farmer instead.

166
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
Duke Chu,

167
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,320
was that enough for you?

168
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
Official Li.

169
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
Official Li.

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
I was never

171
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
dissatisfied with your plan.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
I really do hope

173
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,000
you return victorious.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm counting on you.

175
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
Very well,

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
I must thank you

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,840
for your blessing.

178
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,880
Your Majesty,

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,960
I must take my leave now.

180
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Official Li.

181
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,880
I am counting on you

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,920
to do your best.

183
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Yu'er, did you see that?

184
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Official Li came back just in time.

185
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
His Majesty

186
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,560
hasn't been so happy

187
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,480
in a very long time.

188
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,960
I never expected

189
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,480
Official Li Deyun's return could turn

190
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,240
the mood around

191
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
for the Imperial Court.

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,200
Li Deyun is a leader of civil officers.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
He has a great reputation.

194
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,040
To ensure his safety,

195
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
my brother had to demote him

196
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
so he could hide his true capability.

197
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
He's been honing his skills for years.

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Now that he's returned...

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,480
As you can see,

200
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,480
the bootlickers

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,120
are all siding with him.

202
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,680
I see.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,320
The Late Emperor had a secret plan.

204
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
My brother had

205
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,200
more than one plan.

206
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,920
All right.

207
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,880
It's getting late.

208
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Go get some rest.

209
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Now?

210
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,600
Conserve your strength for later.

211
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Come with me tonight,
we're meeting my uncle.

212
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes.

213
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,960
Chen.

214
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,480
Your Majesty.

215
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
Your Majesty.

216
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,600
Aunt Ninghe.

217
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Please, formality is not needed.

218
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
I am grateful for your help.

219
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,680
Otherwise, I would have

220
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
followed the same fate as my brother.

221
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,120
Your Majesty went through great danger

222
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
in bringing me home

223
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,560
and letting Chen use his
marvelous medicinal skill

224
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,000
to awaken me.

225
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,920
This must be

226
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,040
fate's planning.

227
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,040
Shi Quanzhong

228
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,560
still has some forces in Lucong.

229
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
At the moment,

230
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,840
they are under my command.

231
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Chen Yintai's every move

232
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
is being monitored.

233
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
Your Majesty.

234
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
There is nothing to worry about.

235
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
I appreciate your help, Aunt Ninghe.

236
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,080
Your Majesty.

237
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,160
the Princess is still very weak.

238
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,000
She needs rest.

239
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
Aunt Ninghe,

240
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
rest well.

241
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,760
Your Majesty.

242
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,960
Your Majesty.

243
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,960
Congratulations.

244
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,520
The situation in Lucong and Zhenwu

245
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
has stalled Qiu Ziliang.

246
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,800
That allowed Official Li

247
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
the chance to return
to the Imperial Court.

248
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,120
This is only temporary.

249
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
The outcome

250
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,360
is still full of uncertainties.

251
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,600
As the Princess alluded to,

252
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
this is fate.

253
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,440
The righteous will always get aid.

254
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,640
As long as Your Majesty
cares about the people,

255
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Qiu Ziliang will be defeated eventually.

256
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
You have my thanks, Uncle.

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,800
You saved Aunt Ninghe.

258
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,360
I was merely doing my job.

259
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,320
But Your Majesty and Yu'er's injury...

260
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,520
I'll manage.

261
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
But as long as

262
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,960
she's with me,

263
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,680
she will always get hurt

264
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
and be in perils.

265
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,520
She can never let her guard down.

266
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,880
Uncle,

267
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
I need a favor from you.

268
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
Anything, Your Majesty.

269
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
In the future,

270
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Qiu Ziliang and I

271
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,560
will be in conflict.

272
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
The slightest mistake

273
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,360
will cost me everything.

274
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,720
But with Yu'er

275
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,640
by my side,

276
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
she will only be a distraction.

277
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
So Uncle,

278
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,040
when the time is right,

279
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,960
take her away.

280
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Yu'er will not leave you.

281
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Which is why...

282
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
I need you

283
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,120
to take her away as soon as possible.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Uncle.

285
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,920
Please.

286
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,360
I will

287
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,640
get it done.

288
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,440
I found it.

289
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Is it Ninghe?

290
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,800
No.

291
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,560
It's the Right Minister.

292
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,360
The Right Minister is mysterious.

293
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
There was no entry point to investigate.

294
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,880
I once heard Official Qiu

295
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
called him Thirteen.

296
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
So I started searching with this name.

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I traced it back to this lead.

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,840
Well done.

299
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
It was the 9th year of Tai'an,

300
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,440
soon after the Morning Dew Rebellion,

301
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,520
Qiu Ziliang accepted Thirteen's plan

302
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,760
to found the Chess of Generals Camp.

303
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Their motive was to find
the lost posthumous edict

304
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,040
and train the warriors of sacrifice.

305
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,760
We were the first cohort.

306
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,840
We were fortunate

307
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,160
to rose to fame.

308
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
We became the Golden Chess Pieces.

309
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
Only the Golden Chess Pieces

310
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,320
may use their real names.

311
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,240
How ironic.

312
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
I faked my name.

313
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,920
Perhaps Thirteen

314
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,480
was a fake name too.

315
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,680
But that was the real name.

316
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,640
Official Qiu was born
into a poor family.

317
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,680
He once passed out in the mountain
from starvation.

318
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,319
A sage saved his life.

319
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,319
I've heard that story.

320
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,720
The sage concluded that

321
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
he was destined for greatness.

322
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
He was gifted with a mystic treatise.

323
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,599
That's how Qiu Ziliang

324
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,079
learned martial arts.

325
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,319
Do you know

326
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,839
where this sage lives?

327
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,560
The Baikong Temple.

328
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,160
Yes.

329
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,320
It's the place

330
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
we went to yesterday.

331
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,240
Could it be

332
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,280
the encounter from yesterday

333
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
was part of the Right Minister's plan?

334
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
Ru Feng, have some water.

335
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,040
Drink up.

336
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,600
Good horse.

337
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,400
Stay hydrated.

338
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,120
Good horse.

339
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,960
Your Majesty.

340
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Your Majesty.

341
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,520
Why are you taking care of the horse?

342
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,200
We're going out to hunt today.

343
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm here for the preparation.

344
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,600
Besides,

345
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
Ru Feng saved me once.

346
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,480
I should repay

347
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,560
the kindness.

348
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,040
Right.

349
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Is this horse

350
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,520
really a gift from Lady Li

351
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
to Your Majesty?

352
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,320
Everything I own

353
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
is a gift from someone.

354
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,800
That includes you.

355
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,800
No, I am not.

356
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,480
I was indeed

357
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,920
gifted to Your Majesty by my aunt.

358
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,760
Your Majesty.

359
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,000
Why are you here?

360
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm here as Your Majesty's navigator.

361
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Do you remember the way?

362
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,240
There was a change of venue.

363
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,400
It's best to follow me there.

364
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Aren't we going out to hunt?

365
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Have a guess.

366
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,360
I...

367
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,160
Let's go.

368
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,640
I can guide the way.

369
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,520
As for Miss Cheng,

370
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,960
it's best that she stays here.

371
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
She goes wherever I go.

372
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,200
Your Majesty.

373
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,640
I shouldn't join you.

374
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,120
It's a matter of great importance.

375
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,080
Your Majesty should hurry there.

376
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,000
I admire your wise judgment.

377
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,600
"I admire your wise judgment."

378
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
You're just threatening me.

379
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
Spare me your pretense.

380
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,800
I would go if I could.

381
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,800
Yu'er.

382
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,360
Aunt.

383
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,040
You're back.

384
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Is Prince An safe?

385
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,960
Save that for later.

386
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
You're all grown up now.

387
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
It's time for you to get married.

388
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
What do you mean?

389
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,720
Come with me.

390
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
Where are we going?

391
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
The Grand Empress Dowager
wants to meet you.

392
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
Sit.

393
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,080
It's all right.

394
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,520
I'll just stand here.

395
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,160
Both of your parents had passed away.

396
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,800
Madam Cheng and Eunuch Cheng are

397
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
your only family.

398
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,440
Yes.

399
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,800
There was a famine in my hometown
when I was a child.

400
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,040
My parents died of starvation.

401
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,720
I was sold by human traffickers...

402
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
While you were in Madam Cheng's care,

403
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
what else have you learned other than

404
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
sword play and dancing?

405
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
- I...
- Grand Empress Dowager.

406
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,320
Yu'er has a brilliant mind.

407
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,840
She can learn anything

408
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
at an amazing pace.

409
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
Show your gratitude.

410
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
Much obliged, Grand Empress Dowager.

411
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,840
Stay by His Majesty's side
and serve him.

412
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,120
Yes.

413
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,040
Aunt.

414
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,760
You should have this.

415
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,040
This is the Peach Blossom Jade Bangle.

416
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
It's the bridewealth from
the Grand Empress Dowager.

417
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,640
I can't take it from you.

418
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,840
Keep it safe.

419
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
Bridewealth?

420
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
Why would she give me bridewealth?

421
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,840
His Majesty is very fond of you.

422
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
The Grand Empress Dowager

423
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,240
has agreed to let you
be His Majesty's wife.

424
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,120
That hurts!

425
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,160
I think I sprained my leg.

426
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Your Majesty.

427
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm sorry for the sudden change

428
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,320
of venue.

429
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
There are eyes and ears everywhere.

430
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
It's only right to be cautious.

431
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Indeed.

432
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,280
Within a month,

433
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Misha should arrive in Zhenwu.

434
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
Zhenwu will demand

435
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
explanations from the Imperial Court

436
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,720
for the murder of their retainers.

437
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,680
When that happens,

438
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
we'll get another month of time.

439
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
But delaying it

440
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,320
will not solve

441
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,400
Your Majesty's predicament.

442
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Which is why

443
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,320
in the next two months,

444
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,960
you are the key to seize

445
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Qiu Ziliang's power without the need

446
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
of bloodshed.

447
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,120
How are you?

448
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
My leg feels better now.

449
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,640
I don't need the harness.

450
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,400
Dismissed.

451
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Your Majesty seems to have
acquired essential information.

452
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,080
Your Majesty.

453
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
Who now has the bow

454
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,760
I had gifted to Your Majesty?

455
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,360
I don't know.

456
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,080
I know.

457
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,680
Guards.

458
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Your Majesty.

459
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,840
You should keep this bow.

460
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Otherwise, my father would heartbroken.

461
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,800
Is this a threat?

462
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,160
I wouldn't dare.

463
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
However...

464
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
Please give me another chance.

465
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,440
I regret

466
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
that I couldn't stay for you

467
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,120
all those years ago.

468
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,040
Please give me another chance.

469
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
Allow my father and I

470
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,720
to aid you.

471
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,400
I

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,080
(do have feelings for Yu'er.)

473
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,080
(But it's purely my feelings for her
as a ruler,)

474
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,880
(admiration for a sword as a swordsman,)

475
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
(and the joy a painter has)

476
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
(upon seeing a scenic view.)

477
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,960
It's not romance.

478
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,960
So

479
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,400
Yu'er cannot be my wife.

480
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,320
She will not be the mother
of my children.

481
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Stop following me.

482
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,400
Leave.

483
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
I hope Your Majesty

484
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,840
reconsider my proposal.

485
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,840
I'll come

486
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,160
for an answer in a few days.

487
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,080
I can give you the answer right away.

488
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,960
Your Majesty hasn't
considered it thoroughly.

489
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
Take some time to think it through.

490
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,400
What's bothering you?

491
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,920
Your Majesty.

492
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,600
Not a single spike in its fur.

493
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Of my years of hunting,

494
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
this is the best I've got.

495
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
It shall be your reward.

496
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,480
You may wear it on you.

497
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,480
I...

498
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,120
What's wrong?

499
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,160
Are you too embarrassed to
accept my gift?

500
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,320
Take it.

501
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,280
Is this...

502
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,600
the Grand Empress Dowager's bangle.

503
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,120
Your Majesty.

504
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,000
You once gave me a warning.

505
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,240
So this wasn't my intention.

506
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,760
But I was summoned

507
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,720
by the Grand Empress Dowager earlier

508
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,120
and she gave me this.

509
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,160
Enough.

510
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,640
Your Majesty.

511
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,800
Your Majesty seems to be
enjoying the leisure.

512
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,840
The nation faces a crisis.

513
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,440
Your Majesty

514
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,360
actually has the leisure

515
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,360
to go out on a hunt.

516
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
An exquisite white fox.

517
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,800
Good.

518
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,160
We should have fun while we can.

519
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,000
Two months from now,

520
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
all the joy might be gone

521
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,520
from Your Majesty's life.

522
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,120
But I

523
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,400
beg to differ.

524
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,400
Your Majesty believes Li Deyun
will return with victory.

525
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Or perhaps Princess Ninghe is awake.

526
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,840
Your Majesty,

527
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,240
she will never be awake.

528
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,440
She had passed away.

529
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,760
Nonsense.

530
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,160
If the Princess has passed away,

531
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,720
wouldn't that be her demise?

532
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
Your Majesty,

533
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,560
she has met her demise.

534
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
Sir.

535
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,320
Qi Yan is arrogant

536
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,160
beyond reasons.

537
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,960
He was trying to provoke you!

538
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,760
He might as well ask for humiliation.

539
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,520
Your Majesty.

540
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
It's time for your dinner.

541
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm not hungry.

542
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,200
Dine without me.

543
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,600
Your Majesty.

544
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,160
It was my fault.

545
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
I've been in the palace all day.

546
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,240
But I spent the whole time
being paranoid by Taiye Pond.

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840
Had I

548
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,320
come to visit Princess Ninghe,

549
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,640
it would have...

550
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,760
Qiu Ziliang wanted her dead.

551
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
If you were here,

552
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,800
you would have been killed too.

553
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
I could have stalled them

554
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,400
and informed you.

555
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,640
Perhaps the outcome

556
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,600
would be different.

557
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,040
No.

558
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,880
You can't do a thing.

559
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,760
You saw what happened here.

560
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,840
As long as you're by my side,

561
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,720
you will be in constant peril.

562
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
Your Majesty.

563
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,120
Bring it here.

564
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,160
What?

565
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,240
The bangle.

566
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,800
I wasn't informed
of Grand Empress Dowager's plan

567
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,960
for your marriage.

568
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,680
You should forget it.

569
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,480
Yes.

570
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,159
Dismissed.

571
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,719
Yu'er, stop right there!

572
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,280
You knew His Majesty

573
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,639
was in a bad mood.

574
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,040
So why did you say that to him?

575
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,679
It's no surprise he was mad at you.

576
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,280
You had it coming.

577
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,000
He took away

578
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,200
the Peach Blossom Jade Bangle.

579
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,120
Uncle.

580
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,600
I feel restless.

581
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
For me,

582
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840
His Majesty is the Emperor.

583
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,560
He's the man

584
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,160
I will devote my life to serve.

585
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,760
I had doubts at first.

586
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,080
I was blinded by false rumors.

587
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,080
But I'm glad

588
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,880
that I chose to stay

589
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
and learn who he really is.

590
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,400
So

591
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,280
all I want is to be

592
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,400
a loyal servant,

593
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,520
a brave bodyguard,

594
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,040
and his best Sword Bearer.

595
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,400
As for the rest,

596
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,320
I wouldn't dare to give them any thought

597
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,320
not am I willing to.

598
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,680
Yu'er.

599
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,560
I understand

600
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,200
your concern.

601
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,280
I will never lecture you
on the matter again.

602
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,680
All right.

603
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,360
It's getting late.

604
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,880
Rest well.

605
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,440
Your Majesty.

606
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,800
I will stay up tonight to mourn
my aunt's passing.

607
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,720
I don't need any servants.

608
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,360
You may go now.

609
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

610
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,800
(Yu'er.)

611
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,720
(You are loyal to me.)

612
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,520
(You would risk your life for me.)

613
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
(But don't you know)

614
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,760
(that love is now)

615
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,600
(a luxury for me.)

616
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,440
(I will bring peace to the world)

617
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,000
(so you may live)

618
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,880
(a better life.)

619
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,040
Ninghe passed away.

620
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Official Qiu suffocated her

621
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,240
with a pillow.

622
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
She was struggling,

623
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,240
so it took quite a while.

624
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,280
We are in charge of the Camp,

625
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
but the Shencai Army sneaked past us.

626
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,680
It took Qiu Ziliang a long time
to gain influence.

627
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,720
He won't succeed so easily.

628
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,080
We shall proceed patiently.

629
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,680
Now that Ninghe is gone,

630
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,960
Qi Yan's path will be

631
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,640
full of challenges.

632
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,800
Even if Chen Yintai surrendered,

633
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,240
Official Qiu wouldn't

634
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
let him get away so easily.

635
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,880
An impeccable plot of sabotage.

636
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,880
Remarkable.

637
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Do you find this amusing?

638
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,640
I think the Right Minister

639
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,400
is more worried than we are.

640
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,920
It's almost time.

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,680
Head to the Sunny Rain Pavilion.

642
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
She's here.

643
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
Compete however you want.

644
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,320
But remember,

645
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,600
no killings.

646
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,200
It'd be hard to explain to my superiors.

647
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,720
Right Minister, since you're here,

648
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,400
why not show us

649
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,080
your face behind that mask?

650
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,120
Very well.

651
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,560
My first question,

652
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
who are you?

653
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,160
Does false answer count now?

654
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,120
I ordered my uncle to awaken you.

655
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
But my kind intention
caused your death.

656
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,800
Aunt Ninghe,

657
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,120
I am sorry.

658
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,560
I will...

659
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,120
I will avenge you

660
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,680
with my own hands.

661
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,720
Why did you

662
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,960
choose to help me?

663
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,440
Nonsense!

664
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,480
I don't have a grandfather.

665
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
It's you.

666
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,480
You worthless ruler!

667
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,840
I'll end you now!

668
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,200
Ziyuan.

669
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,080
Han Yue is dead.

670
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,040
You can still turn over a new leaf.

671
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,040
You killed my family

672
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,240
and slaughtered my master.

673
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,720
I must wreak vengeance on you!

674
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,480
Qiu Ziliang gave the order
to kill your family.

675
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,400
He killed Han Yue too.

676
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,600
He's the one you want.

677
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't care.

678
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,680
You are all villains.

679
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Die!

680
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,080
Spare her life.

681
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,720
Worthless Emperor.

682
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,880
Your Majesty.

683
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What should we do with her?

684
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,440
Your Majesty.

685
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,800
I was late to defend Your Majesty.

686
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,360
Please leave her to me.
