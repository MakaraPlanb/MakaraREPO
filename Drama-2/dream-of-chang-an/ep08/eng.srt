14
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Qiu Yanzhi.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Why are you here?

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
Where did you take Aunt Cai?

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,800
What do you want

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
before you can let her go?

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
Madam Cai is dead.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
What?

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,720
You...

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080
After she was taken to prison,

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
she died unexpectedly
in the middle of the night.

24
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,720
Why did you kill her?

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
I hadn't got the answers I wanted.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
Why would I let her die?

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
What exactly happened?

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,560
What is your motive?

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
I want answers to these three questions.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
First,

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,800
why did His Majesty visit
Cai's Wine Store?

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,880
Second,

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
why did the assassins

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
decide to take action here twice?

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Third,

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,800
who is the man

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
that killed the assassins?

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,200
You witnessed

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,760
all of the assassinations in person.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't you want to know the answers?

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Tell me how did Aunt Cai die.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,480
She was poisoned.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Who did that?

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,200
What is this?

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
The person who killed Madam Cai

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,240
is hiding here.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Why are you

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
telling me

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
such an important piece of information?

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
You owe me a favor.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,960
Now,

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
it's time to pay it back.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,640
Find the assassins.

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
They must be related

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
to Guan Wu's case.

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,760
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Your archery has improved.

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,920
Really?

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
But, I think that

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
my skill is stagnating.

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
I summon you here today,

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
hoping that

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
you can help me improve.

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
Shooting dead items

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
is too easy

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
for Your Majesty now.

68
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,440
Why not we replace it
with living things?

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,120
Living things?

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,560
What living things?

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,160
Make the death row prisoners run
holding an arrow target.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,880
What do you think, Your Majesty?

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
That sounds like a good idea.

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,960
But,

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,520
most of the death row prisoners

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,480
can't do martial arts.

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,440
Why don't we replace them

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
with the people
from Purple Clothing Bureau?

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,080
While I practice archery,

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
the people from Purple Clothing Bureau
can practice their martial arts too.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
That's killing two birds with one stone.

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,600
Are you reluctant?

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
The 36 maids have undergone training
for many years.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
It wasn't an easy thing.

86
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,880
If they can't even dodge

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
my arrows,

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
and are so mediocre,

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,200
they might as well die.

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
Issue an edict.

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,480
From tomorrow on,

92
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
all members of Purple Clothing Bureau
will join my practice.

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Matron,

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
is it true that

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
His Majesty wants us
to be his practice targets

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
and practice archery with him?

98
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,880
His Majesty is suspecting us.

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,400
His Majesty was the masked man

100
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
who was following Yu'er

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
yesterday night.

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,480
How is that possible?

103
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
The masked man
went to the Zheng Residence,

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,840
and also the Chess of Generals Camp.

105
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,880
It's not entirely impossible.

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
He must have heard

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
our conversation,

108
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
and grown suspicious.

109
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,800
Now, he's trying to test us.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
What should we do now?

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
We can sacrifice 36 people.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,880
But, the 300 people at Yuzhen Hall,

113
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,160
are the fruits
of our many years' effort.

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
Evacuate them immediately.

115
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,640
Don't let His Majesty find out.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Hurry up.

117
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600
Leave no traces behind.

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Yes.

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,040
What is this?

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
This is the details of the expenses

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,040
Your Majesty spent on hunting
for the past few years.

122
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,200
That's a lot of money.

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Wine?

124
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
I didn't know that

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
I drink so much

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
while I hunt.

127
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,600
If you're so smart,

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
why don't you investigate it yourself?

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
You only passed me a book.

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,960
Do you take me as a fool?

131
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
(There really is something going on.)

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,120
Brother,

133
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
it's late at night.

134
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,440
What happened?

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,600
Xi'er.

136
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
His Majesty is missing.

137
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
What?

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
His Majesty is missing.

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,799
Yes.

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,280
His Majesty hit the sack early tonight.

141
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
When I was patrolling,

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
I noticed that
His Majesty wasn't in his bed.

143
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,040
Before His Majesty went to bed,

144
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,800
he...

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Brother,

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
what happened?

147
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
He audited the Purple Clothing Bureau,

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
and also his own expenses.

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
What did he find?

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
There was a huge amount spent on wine

151
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,200
in Night-fox Hunting.

152
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
Xi'er,

153
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,600
tell me honestly.

154
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Did you

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
tamper with the ledger?

156
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
(Is this the place)

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
(Cheng Xi mentioned?)

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
(The hiding place for the 300 people.)

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
(You colluded with your aunt)

160
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
(to deceive me.)

161
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Oh, no.

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
His Majesty went to Yuzhen Hall.

163
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Have everyone evacuated the place?

164
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
Al...almost.

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Didn't I tell you to hurry up?

166
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,600
But,

167
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
we received the order

168
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,520
six hours ago.

169
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
We didn't think it was this urgent.

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh, no.

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Yuzhen Hall's rules say that

172
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
all trespassers

173
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
shall be killed.

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,000
Cheng Xi has fallen into the trap.

175
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Great.

176
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,800
Prepare the team.

177
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
We will set off immediately.

178
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,680
Are you coming too?

179
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,680
This is a serious matter.

180
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
We shall stay together.

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Alright.

182
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
(I've searched the place,
and found nothing.)

183
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
Moon Dancing Hall.

184
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,120
(Is this an opera house?)

185
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,040
(This is strange.)

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
(Where did everyone go?)

187
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
(It seems like I have to do something.)

188
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
I heard that

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
this place has nice performances.

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm here to see it myself.

191
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Anyone here?

192
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,200
(What?)

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
(Does she not know what this place is?)

194
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,040
I do know a thing or two.

195
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
Do you want to fight with me?

196
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
You dare kill others,
but are afraid to confront me.

197
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,040
Cowards.

198
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
It's you again.

199
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
I said that

200
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,200
I must beat you this time.

201
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,280
Be careful.

202
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Your Majesty.

203
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,120
The bell.

204
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,840
It has stopped.

205
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
Someone's here.
What should we do?

206
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
Search the place.

207
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,480
Yes.

208
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
Find them.

209
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,680
Cheng Ruoyu.

210
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
Cheng Ruoyu, what's wrong?

211
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
Please don't get an attack at this time.

212
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
Who are you?

213
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Who are you?

214
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,560
Who are you?

215
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,760
Lord, look at this.

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,400
Search the place.

217
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Here.

218
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,839
How do you feel?

219
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,200
Are you feeling better?

220
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
We have to quickly figure out

221
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
how to leave this place.

222
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,320
Got it.

223
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,640
Your Majesty.

224
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,080
Your Majesty, stay still.

225
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
You're injured.

226
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,920
Remove it.

227
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,200
Why are you not removing it yet?

228
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,720
Your Majesty, please bear with me.

229
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Please bear with me.

230
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
There must be

231
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
a secret passage
that's connected to another place.

232
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Let's find it.

233
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
Break the Sun Wonder and Moon Wonder.

234
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Destroy the Delusion, Scenery,
and Fear Doors.

235
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,920
Break the Sun Wonder and Moon Wonder.

236
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Destroy the Delusion, Scenery,
and Fear Doors. Quick!

237
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, yes.

238
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
There's a trap at the east.

239
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,320
There's a trap at the southwest.

240
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
There's also a trap at the north.

241
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,360
Where is it?

242
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,480
Where's the Life Door?

243
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
Come.

244
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,320
Your Majesty.

245
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
My sword broke.

246
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
Stop crying.

247
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,400
I'll reward you with
100 new swords later.

248
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
The Life Door is there.

249
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Take care of yourself.

250
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't destroy the Life Door.

251
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
They have found the entrance.

252
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,840
Qiu Yanzhi.

253
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,640
Yes.

254
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,120
She said that
I can find the killer here.

255
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,640
Killer?

256
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
What killer?

257
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Aunt Cai is dead.

258
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,960
Yanzhi said the killer is here.

259
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,760
Have you not realized that

260
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
we all have fallen into the trap?

261
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
What do you mean?

262
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,560
While we're after them,

263
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,120
someone else is after us.

264
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
I have to leave here immediately.

265
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
They can't see me.

266
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,840
Your Majesty,

267
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
Yanzhi won't kill me yet.

268
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,480
When we find the exit,

269
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,080
you shall leave first.

270
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I'll buy you some time.

271
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
The center of the array must be here,

272
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,800
and the exit must be somewhere here too.

273
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Let's find it.

274
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I need a few more men. Hurry up!

275
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Yes.

276
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,600
Be careful.

277
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,360
Be careful.

278
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,960
Ruoyu.

279
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Are you okay?

280
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm fine.

281
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,520
(She's the only one)

282
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,480
(who will protect you,)

283
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
(and even die for you,)

284
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,200
(at critical moments like this.)

285
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,200
How are you?

286
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Are you hurt?

287
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Give me a hand.

288
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Step back.

289
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,320
Yes.

290
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Where are they?

291
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,920
This is the secret passage.

292
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,320
Where does this lead to?

293
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,560
I've no idea.

294
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's go there and have a look.

295
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's go.

296
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,480
I'm sure I saw two persons

297
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,320
went in here.

298
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,520
Report.

299
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Lord,

300
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
there's no one in the courtyard.

301
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
No one?

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,520
Did the ghost ring the bell?

303
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,480
They are gone.

304
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
But, the booby trap is still here.

305
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,080
Leave no stones unturned.

306
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Unearth this thing.

307
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Yes.

308
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,040
Your Majesty.

309
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,320
Over there.

310
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Please be careful, Your Majesty.

311
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,080
Your Majesty,

312
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
I can't run anymore.

313
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,120
I need to take a break.

314
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,680
Hurry up.

315
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,560
Get up.

316
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,360
I took the medicine,

317
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,440
and am feeling so sleepy.

318
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
I need to take a break.

319
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,760
Without my Sword Bearer protecting me,

320
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,200
how am I supposed to proceed?

321
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
I will rest for just a while.

322
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Just a while.

323
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,600
Just a while.

324
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Sure.

325
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,880
This area

326
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
seems to be relatively safe.

327
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
We will

328
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,920
take a rest here.

329
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,640
Thanks, Your Majesty.

330
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
But, it was really strange.

331
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Who sounded the alarm?

332
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Who let us go?

333
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,440
If I ever find out

334
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
who let us go,

335
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll send her my gratitude.

336
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
She put you in danger.

337
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yet, you still want to thank her.

338
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Aren't we

339
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
being released?

340
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Besides,

341
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
it was us who broke into
Yuzhen Hall first.

342
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,760
As for them,

343
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
it should be for self-defense, right?

344
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
Under my reign,

345
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
do you think it's rational

346
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,280
that the former mansion

347
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
of the princess

348
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,240
stores such a huge weapon?

349
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
What a brilliant mind.

350
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,840
How many secrets

351
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
have been kept

352
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,640
by Chess of Generals Camp and
Yuzhen Hall?

353
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
What else did Yanzhi tell you

354
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
aside from the murderer

355
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
of Aunt Cai

356
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,480
who appeared in Yuzhen Hall?

357
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,680
She told me that

358
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,920
there must be someone behind Wu.

359
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,120
That person saved her previously

360
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
and sent her into the palace

361
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,200
then forced her to assassinate.

362
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,200
The person is with concealed intention.

363
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,760
Your Majesty,

364
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,200
why did you halt me from

365
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
investigating the case of Wu

366
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,800
as well as those who tried
to assassinate you?

367
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,160
Do you

368
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
really not care about it?

369
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,920
If you do investigate Wu,

370
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
it'll involve the old issue of
eight years ago.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
Zheng Wu,

372
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,200
I admit that

373
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,920
I purposely released her then.

374
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
You're the one who released her?

375
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,800
Are you the one

376
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
who sent Wu into the palace too?

377
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,440
No.

378
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,400
I didn't know

379
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,400
she would return to seek trouble.

380
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
She could be manipulated by others.

381
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
Manipulated by others?

382
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,600
Who is it?

383
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't question if you're not supposed

384
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,320
to ask.

385
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
The more you know,

386
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
the closer you're to death.

387
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,000
Lying that you're tired
because of the medicine.

388
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,480
Silly.

389
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
Lord.

390
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Three hundred swords.

391
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,560
Who forged it?

392
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,160
Who owned it?

393
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
What's their intention?

394
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Playing such trick

395
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,080
under my nose,

396
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,280
What atrocious bravery.

397
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,360
Appease your anger, please.

398
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
-Appease your anger, please.
-Shut your mouth.

399
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,120
You're so great.

400
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
Chess of Generals Camp who claimed

401
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
to get Heng'an City in control

402
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
is in fact

403
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
a mere talk.

404
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
Why should I need you?

405
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,480
Previously,

406
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
I started from a small post
who bathed the horses.

407
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,560
I worked prudently

408
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,680
and entrenched step by step

409
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,960
to finally head
Chess of Generals Camp.

410
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Look at you.

411
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
A bunch of fools.

412
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,080
Men.

413
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Tell me

414
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,880
how many times?

415
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Say!

416
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,560
30 times.

417
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
Stop howling.

418
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
It's just a small injury.

419
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,360
Wonder how's

420
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
your niece?

421
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,960
Your Majesty.

422
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
I beg of you

423
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,480
never run out from

424
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
the palace secretly again.

425
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,400
It's very dangerous.

426
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,080
Dangerous?

427
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
Do you know

428
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,960
what danger did I encounter?

429
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,200
Your Majesty.

430
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,520
Please forgive me.

431
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,320
I didn't have any intention.

432
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
I was saying that

433
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
since Your Majesty and Yu'er

434
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,760
were severely injured,

435
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,320
you must have encountered

436
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,160
great danger.

437
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Your Majesty,

438
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,280
I really don't have any intention.

439
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Call for the imperial physician.

440
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,120
Your Majesty,

441
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,520
don't call for the imperial physician
right now.

442
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,360
Otherwise,

443
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,440
the secret of you wandering out
from the palace

444
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,040
will be revealed.

445
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Well.

446
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
I'll do it myself.

447
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,400
Get me some premiere medicine

448
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,720
and guard the door outside.

449
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
No one is allowed to enter.

450
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,160
Understood.

451
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Bear it.

452
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,400
My sword is broken.

453
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I'll repay you with one.

454
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,600
Refusing me to become Sword Bearer

455
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,000
and now even the sword is broken.

456
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,680
Do you truly want to be
my Sword Bearer?

457
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,680
We were rushing while retreating

458
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,239
and left our traces behind.

459
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,560
Fortunately, someone notified us
with the bell

460
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,800
to let the ladies escaped safely.

461
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,040
As I recalled,

462
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,639
once Aunt Cai was captured,

463
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,360
we have gradually entered

464
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
the trap designed by them.

465
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,560
It's my fault,

466
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,719
please punish me.

467
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,120
We

468
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,880
have underestimated Chou Yanzhi.

469
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,480
But, His Majesty
didn't discover anything

470
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,960
in Yuzhen Hall.

471
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,199
Therefore,

472
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,520
you could pretend to know nothing.

473
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,920
It's such a big Bagua formation.

474
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,199
It's my mistake if I knew about it,

475
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
or I'm incapable
if I didn't know about it.

476
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,239
Since His Majesty has become suspicious,

477
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,960
he will investigate it.

478
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
It'll become worse

479
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
if I keep on denying it
and lose his trust.

480
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,560
Rather than idling here,

481
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,400
it's better to take some action.

482
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,520
I'll come clear before His Majesty.

483
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,640
Guard outside.

484
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,480
Understood.

485
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,920
What's wrong?

486
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
Why are you nervous?

487
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm curing her injury.

488
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,240
Moreover,

489
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
you're not my type.

490
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Fragile

491
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
and scrawny.

492
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,120
Do you think

493
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,000
I have an interest in you?

494
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,040
In your dream.

495
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Don't scream.

496
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,080
Shut up mouth.

497
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
Can't you stand such a small injury,

498
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
Sword Bearer?

499
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,120
Bear it.

500
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,240
It's done.

501
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,920
Your Majesty.

502
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Madam Cheng from Purple Clothing Bureau
seeks your audience.

503
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
Ask her to wait outside first.

504
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm almost done.

505
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,200
Yes.

506
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,640
Maybe...

507
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm fine.

508
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,840
Besides sword and clothing,

509
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
in the well of Yuzhen Hall,

510
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,720
we scooped up some combs,

511
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,720
hair accessories,

512
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
fly-whisks and so on.

513
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,520
But, all of them were immersed in water

514
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
until no traces

515
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,200
were left.

516
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Not really.

517
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,240
The origin of the pearl,

518
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
its mosaic craftsmanship,

519
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,320
which shop created it.

520
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
As well as this cut.

521
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,400
It's obviously slashed by the sword.

522
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,720
However, the sword slashed stopped.

523
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,360
That's why this pearl

524
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,400
was half-slashed

525
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,240
and half being broken forcibly.

526
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,720
The sword was wielded by a woman.

527
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
Probably she couldn't take down 50 moves

528
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,480
if she had fought me.

529
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
What if it was

530
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,000
300 of this kind of woman

531
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
to fight you?

532
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,600
300?

533
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,800
I won't force myself.

534
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,240
I would run away.

535
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,720
Women appreciate beauty so much.

536
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,560
Even wearing hair accessorries
while battling

537
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,640
as well as when escaping.

538
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,280
Investigate through this clue.

539
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,600
Yes, Chess Manager.

540
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,560
Madam Cheng.

541
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,920
What brings you here?

542
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,640
What's this?

543
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
This real name list of
Purple Clothing Bureau.

544
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
How to decode them?

545
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,720
The zither has thirteen notes,

546
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,040
which represents thirteen people.

547
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,480
Every fingering signifies their action.

548
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,600
For example, the tenth-flip-fourth.

549
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
It seems that the ring finger

550
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,520
presses on the tenth note

551
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
and middle finger flips
the fourth string.

552
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
In fact, it means

553
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,480
the tenth member killed four.

554
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,760
Therefore,

555
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,240
Purple Clothing Bureau

556
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,720
has a concealed power inside.

557
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,040
You have been hiding from me.

558
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
I didn't.

559
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm just

560
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,360
upholding the command of
the previous emperor.

561
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,360
You meant

562
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
it's the command of my brother?

563
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,360
Yes.

564
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
After Morning Dew Rebellion,

565
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
the previous emperor
was grounded by Chou Ziliang

566
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
and couldn't do anything.

567
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,480
That's why he ordered me

568
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,640
to pick girls who have potential
in martial arts

569
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,080
and re-establish
Purple Clothing Bureau.

570
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,280
Your Majesty,

571
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,120
you're aware of this too.

572
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
I do know.

573
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
But,

574
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,400
he didn't ask you

575
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,360
to re-build Yuzhen Hall though.

576
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,160
Changming palace is full of
eunuchs' spies.

577
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,080
As thousands people is a big sum,

578
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,040
to avoid Chou Ziliang's attention,

579
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
I could only choose the best child

580
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
and send them out

581
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,360
for training little by little.

582
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,440
Really?

583
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,760
Why didn't you report to me

584
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,040
after I've ascended to the throne?

585
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,840
As the previous emperor's decree,

586
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,960
if the new emperor is ambitious,

587
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,960
we should offer our assistance.

588
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,960
If...

589
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,080
If the emperor follows the villain

590
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,200
and incapable,

591
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,800
are you planning to betray me?

592
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,360
I daren't.

593
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,720
I remain silent due to

594
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,600
the command of the previous emperor

595
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,560
as well as I'm incapable.

596
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,960
Until now, amongst the 300 warriors,

597
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,640
not to mention to compare to
Your Majesty,

598
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,840
there are minimal of them

599
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,600
who's more skillful than Yu'er.

600
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,760
They're unworthy to be at your service.

601
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
Where are the 300 warriors?

602
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,720
They've left the city

603
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,720
and hid at Mount Qi.

604
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,320
How about the previous night...

605
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,000
It was the scheme of Chou Yanzhi.

606
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,720
Great.

607
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,400
Great.

608
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,200
Rise.

609
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,600
Your Highness.

610
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,880
300 warriors of Yuzhen Hall

611
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,360
have reached Mount Qi safely.

612
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,520
Got it.

613
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,400
Purple Clothing Bureau has encountered
such heavy blow,

614
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,400
I'm afraid it might take times
to recover.

615
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,640
Rise.

616
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

617
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
Since the day Zheng Fu

618
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
was being investigated

619
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
after revealing Purple Clothing Bureau,

620
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
I should have foreseen

621
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,320
Yuzhen Hall would be exposed.

622
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,200
Cheng Xi has underestimated Chou Yanzhi.

623
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,720
Therefore, she has lost the game

624
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,720
before she even started.

625
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,000
Fortunately,

626
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,000
you've predicted

627
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,160
Yuzhen Hall will be exposed to danger

628
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
and sent me to observe them secretly
in advance.

629
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,400
Simultaneously, alerted them with
the bell upon discovering

630
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,520
Chess of Generals Camp
launched the attack.

631
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,720
Those people were then saved.

632
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,160
Does it help?

633
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,480
His Majesty's power is still inferior.

634
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
How is he able to act against
Chou Ziliang?

635
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,920
I must think of a way

636
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
to return to help him.

637
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,280
But,

638
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,360
the empress dowager is
suspicious of you.

639
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,000
Besides, His Majesty won't trust you.

640
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,560
And for Chou Ziliang,

641
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,200
he won't take any action

642
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,080
if you don't.

643
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
But if you do...

644
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
Why are you putting yourself
in grave danger?

645
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,040
What if any accidents happen

646
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,640
since you have no martial art skills?

647
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,360
What I pursue

648
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,240
is the well-being and harmony

649
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,760
of the prosperity of this nation.

650
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,280
As for the others,

651
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,000
they're all trivia.
