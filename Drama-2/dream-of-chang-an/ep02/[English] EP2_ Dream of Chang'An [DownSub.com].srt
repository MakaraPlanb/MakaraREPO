(Instead of backing down,)

15
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,640
what if

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
you take a chance?

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,640
I don't have an appetite.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,720
Take them away.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Huaizhi.

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
How long have you been in the palace?

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
I entered the palace at ten.

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
Until now,

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
it's been 30 years.

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
What about your sister, Madam Cheng?

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,320
Xi'er entered the palace later than me.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,680
But it's been 20 years as well.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,720
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,720
Why are you asking me this?

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,360
20 years?

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,000
Many years ago,

33
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,440
my teacher

34
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
once told me something.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,760
A eunuch's power comes from
the emperor's power.

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
Even if Eunuch Qiu is evil,

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
the reason for the Morning Dew Rebellion

38
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
was Li Xu and Zheng Lu's
personal feud.

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,839
Your Majesty.

40
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,920
Please be careful with your words.

41
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,399
It's fine.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
Within the ten-meter area,

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
no one else is present.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
Li Xu is talented with low ambition.

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,040
Even if he was friends with Zheng Lu

46
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,880
and worked for my brother together,

47
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
after the Morning Dew Rebellion failed,

48
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,920
I captured his confidant

49
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
and found out from the investigation

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,600
that Li Xu once told him

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
to kill Zheng Lu

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,280
after the rebellion succeeded

53
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,000
to prevent Zheng Lu's accomplishment

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
from being more than his.

55
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,000
My brother didn't use the right people

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
and easily believed two villains.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
That was why the news leaked out,

58
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,200
and he was restrained
by Qiu Ziliang.

59
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
So, do you think

60
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,840
that I will trust you and Madam Cheng?

61
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,040
Heaven and earth

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
can attest

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,200
to my loyalty

65
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,560
towards you.

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm definitely not like

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960
Li Xu or Zheng Lu.

69
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,320
Go and tell Cheng Xi

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
that I'll reconsider

71
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
her suggestion.

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,280
Yes.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,880
"Regardless if it's cold
and the horse is freezing,

74
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,520
I only see the wars in the borders
and try my best to kill the enemies."

75
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
(The timing isn't right yet.)

76
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
(So,)

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
(don't worry, Teacher.)

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,080
(I)

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,840
(will continue enduring it.)

80
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,080
That was so scary.

81
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Why am I so dizzy?

82
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
I feel so weak.

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,520
What kind of drug did I take?

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Don't punish me this way.

85
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
If I can't practice martial arts
for six months,

86
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,040
how can I protect His Majesty?

87
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
You may

88
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
have been clever today,

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,160
but you only saw a small part
of the whole picture.

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,400
A small part

91
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,960
of the big picture.

92
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

93
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,760
You dodged a bullet yesterday.

94
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,160
But can you handle

95
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,920
my father's anger?

96
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,160
What are you planning to do next?

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
House arrest?

98
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,720
A seduction strategy.

99
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
I heard that Your Majesty likes hunting.

100
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
The weather is very nice today.

101
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,920
It's very suitable to sap your spirit
by seeking pleasures.

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,960
Your Majesty.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,120
What do you think?

104
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,840
Your Majesty.

105
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
It's time for the imperial
court meeting.

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,160
Today,

107
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm going hunting.

108
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
Inform the Sword Bearer to get changed.

109
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
When I recover,

110
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I must eat to my heart's content.

111
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Who is it?

112
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,920
Sword Bearer.

113
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,600
His Majesty is going hunting today.

114
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
He told you to change
into hunting attire and go with him.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,440
All right.

116
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,160
I got it.

117
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
This is great.

118
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
I have a chance to go out of the palace
to hunt...

119
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,680
What kind of lousy drug

120
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
did Aunt give me?

121
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Why do I feel so weak?

122
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,960
And I'm so dizzy.

123
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,680
I must get changed.

124
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,840
Why are you here?

125
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,680
Where's His Majesty?

126
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,520
His Majesty went there in advance.

127
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
He told me to wait for you here.

128
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,040
Can you handle it?

129
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Don't force yourself.

130
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
I still have the strength

131
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,280
to protect His Majesty.

132
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Why are you laughing?

133
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm laughing

134
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
because how can a Sword Bearer

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
with no martial arts skill
go hunting later?

136
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
Like you,

137
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,840
I don't have any martial arts skill now.

138
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,320
Under such fair circumstances,

139
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
do you want to have a competition?

140
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,880
What will we compete in?

141
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,240
Let's see

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,040
who can get more preys.

143
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,920
What is the bet?

144
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,400
If I lose,

145
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
I'll agree to one request.

146
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,440
As long as it's not against
the palace's rules,

147
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
it's fine.

148
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
What if you win?

149
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,000
If I win,

150
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
please return

151
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,040
to the Chess of Generals Camp.

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Never appear in front

153
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,160
of His Majesty again.

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,920
What do you think?

155
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,280
It's a deal.

156
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,000
Will you tell him,

158
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
or will I?

159
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Your Majesty.

160
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
The Sword Bearer made a bet with me.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,760
Please be the witness.

162
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,200
The one who gets less preys today

163
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
must agree to a request
from the other person.

164
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
If I win,

165
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
the Chess Overseer

166
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,080
will disappear in front

167
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,120
of Your Majesty forever.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,520
That's good.

169
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
With a reward,

170
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
hunting becomes more interesting.

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
In that case,

172
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
let's begin.

173
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll surely win.

174
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,480
Your Majesty.

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,680
Do you really want to keep

176
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,440
a Sword Bearer

177
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
who leaves you by yourself?

178
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,560
If I don't keep her,

179
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
should I keep you then?

180
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,920
Little rabbit.

181
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
Come here.

182
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,960
Don't worry.

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,560
After the competition,

184
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
I'll surely release you.

185
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,880
I surely won't eat you.

186
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,280
For sure.

187
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,880
This should be fine.

188
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,720
This trap should be big enough.

189
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,400
All right.

190
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,120
Cheng Ruoyu.

191
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,720
Cheng Ruoyu.

192
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,480
Your Majesty.

193
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,760
You scared me.

194
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,640
You almost made my prey

195
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,880
run away.

196
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Where is the prey?

197
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
There's nothing here.

198
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,280
There was,

199
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,040
but when you called me,

200
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
it ran away due to fear.

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,760
Cheng Ruoyu.

202
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
How dare you disrespect me?

203
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,160
No.

204
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,720
That's not what I meant.

205
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
I spoke without thinking.

206
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

207
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,200
Cheng Ruoyu.

208
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,200
You can only see a small part
of the whole picture indeed.

209
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,280
You say that I only see a small part
of the whole picture.

210
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,000
You mean

211
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,960
I should guess the whole picture
by just seeing a part?

212
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,440
What are you still doing here?

213
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,840
The competition is about to begin.

214
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Qiu Yanzhi.

215
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Isn't this cheating?

216
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
How can you ask the soldiers
in Chess of Generals Camp

217
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,880
to help you?

218
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
You can also seek help.

219
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,640
But those from the Violet Bureau

220
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,560
didn't come.

221
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,360
That's your negligence then.

222
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Since you came out,

223
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,800
why didn't you bring your subordinates?

224
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,920
Today, let me give you a lesson.

225
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
At any time,

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,920
you must remember

227
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,440
that you're not alone.

228
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,960
What behind you

229
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
is a big organization.

230
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,520
How you use it

231
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,720
and balance it

232
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,640
to achieve your objective

233
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,480
is what you have to learn

234
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
as its leader.

235
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,680
All right.

236
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,960
It seems that you're going to lose.

237
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,160
Not yet.

238
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,440
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

239
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,040
Your self-made trap is good.

240
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,600
But since it's a hunt,

241
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,800
it's still better to use
a bow and arrow.

only foxes count.

Yes.

288
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,440
Only foxes count, right?

289
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,240
Where are yours?

290
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
You don't have any at all?

291
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,080
Qiu Yanzhi, you're going to lose.

292
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,040
You can...

293
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
Where did you get so many foxes?

294
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,440
I exchanged my preys before

295
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
with a merchant.

296
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,440
Your Majesty.

297
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,600
She's cheating again.

298
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Our bet was

299
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,240
the one who has more preys, wins.

300
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,400
Later on,

301
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
based on what His Majesty wants,

302
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
it was changed to the one who catches
more foxes, wins.

303
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
Regardless if we caught
the foxes ourselves,

304
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
or if the soldiers caught them,

305
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,880
or His Majesty caught them,

306
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
or the merchant caught them,

307
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,880
they should all count.

308
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,080
Am I right?

309
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,000
All right.

310
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Next,

311
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,360
I must take my bet now.

312
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,720
All right.

313
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,440
I'll return to the Violet Bureau

314
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,720
and disappear forever.

315
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Who says that's the bet?

316
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,840
What else can it be?

317
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I'm not capable of martial arts skill now.

318
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I can't do anything.

319
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,560
Don't worry.

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
You can surely do this.

321
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,880
(Violet Bureau)

322
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,840
Wu.

323
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
My dear Wu.

324
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,760
Please.

325
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,920
Help me.

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
I'll massage your shoulders and legs.

327
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,040
Please.

328
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
Give it to me.

329
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,400
However,

330
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,600
only this time.

331
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,920
I swear.

332
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
I won't ever lose again.

333
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Don't worry.

334
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,040
Qiu Yanzhi won

335
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
such a big bet,

336
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,160
yet she only told you to do embroidery?

337
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
She just wants me to embarrass myself.

338
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
However,

339
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
I learned something from her.

340
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
If I don't know how to do it,

341
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll ask my subordinate to do it.

342
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,000
I mean,

343
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,200
if a good friend does it,

344
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
of course it would be better.

345
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,360
That's not the style

346
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,240
of Chess of Generals Camp.

347
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,440
At least

348
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,120
it's definitely not Qiu Ziliang's style.

349
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,600
What is Qiu Ziliang's style then?

350
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,120
Take preventive measures,

351
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
and take something out by its root.

352
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
Madam.

353
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
What exactly are you planning?

354
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,360
What are you referring to, Your Majesty?

355
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
Yesterday, you forced me
to take poison,

356
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,880
yet you intentionally delayed it

357
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
for 30 minutes.

358
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,320
Why?

359
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,600
You already heard

360
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,640
the Sword Bearer is in the yard,

361
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,320
yet you took the pill out
at that time.

362
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Why?

363
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,280
In today's hunt,

364
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
you also won the competition,

365
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,760
yet you didn't kick the Sword Bearer out.

366
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Why is that?

367
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,960
Could it be

368
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
that you want to use the hunt

369
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,440
to educate her?

370
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,880
Your Majesty is the one

371
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,440
that I want to educate.

372
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
Before I joined
the Chess of Generals Camp,

373
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,560
I was a maid at Heng'an City's
Music Hall.

374
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,560
I personally witnessed
the citizens' suffering.

375
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,320
Everyone is hoping

376
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,480
to have a wise emperor

377
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,960
to regenerate the imperial regime

378
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
and make our empire prosperous again

379
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
in order to live a good life.

380
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,720
That's why

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,960
I also hope

382
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,600
to assist a wise emperor like that

383
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
and restore the Xing empire.

384
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
Do you think

385
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,920
I'll believe you?

386
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,320
Whether you believe me or not
is up to you.

387
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,640
I'll go ahead.

388
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,440
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

389
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,840
Did Madam Jade and others find out

390
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
Qiu Yanzhi's identity and background?

391
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
There's something fishy
about her indeed.

392
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
Eight years ago,

393
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,080
at the Music Hall,

394
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,120
Qiu Ziliang chose Qiu Yanzhi
to become his pawn.

395
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,080
Afterwards,

396
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,920
after 77 challenges,

397
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,000
she won against 99 people

398
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,560
and became Qiu Ziliang's goddaughter.

399
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
But she was born unhealthy.

400
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,480
She has a heart ailment.
She's not skilled in martial arts.

401
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,200
She's not skilled in martial arts?

402
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
Why do you only have information
about her for the past eight years?

403
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,320
That's the strange part.

404
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,080
Where she came from

405
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
and why she was sold to the Music Hall

406
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,240
cannot be found.

407
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
But this girl

408
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,960
is so smart and knowledgeable,
and she has a good memory.

409
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,480
I think she must not have come
from an ordinary family.

410
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,600
It seems that

411
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,080
someone intentionally eliminated
the information.

412
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,320
Instruct Madam Jade and the others

413
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,400
to continue investigating it.

414
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,040
Even if they have to dig deeper,

415
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,200
they must find Qiu Yanzhi's roots.

416
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,240
(Hanyuan Hall)

417
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,040
Greetings, Grandmother.

418
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,800
(Grand Empress Dowager, Madam Guo)

419
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,440
Come.

420
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Sit down.

421
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Thank you, Grandmother.

422
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Your Majesty is so busy.

423
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,760
Instead of attending to state affairs,

424
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,280
you came here.

425
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,000
Won't that delay
important state affairs?

426
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,920
Duke Chu

427
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
and the officials are managing
the state affairs.

428
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't need to worry about it.

429
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
I accompanied you all the way.

430
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,360
Since you were little,
you've been smart,

431
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,800
and you've had good martial arts skills.

432
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
Even when the late emperor

433
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,240
was talking about you,

434
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,480
he was so proud.

435
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,880
It's not bad to have ambition.

436
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,760
Legitimacy belongs to the victor.

437
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,000
Since you ascended to the throne,

438
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,440
you're proved to be capable.

439
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,080
However,

440
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
why did you only use

441
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,760
your capability

442
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,240
to fight against your own brother?

443
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,400
Why don't you use it

444
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,560
in regenerating the imperial regime?

445
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,760
The Xing empire is facing

446
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,720
the breakaway and occupation
of territories on the outside

447
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,440
and frenzied eunuchs on the inside.

448
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,240
It's corrupt

449
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,760
and has a low population.

450
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
Could it be that you're just

451
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
after the throne

452
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,160
and the title?

453
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Go.

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm tired.

455
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,800
I'll get going.

456
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,280
I admit the defeat.

457
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,600
Why didn't you ask me

458
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,320
how I embroidered this?

459
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,800
You asked someone else to do it.

460
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,360
Your Majesty.

461
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,120
Your Majesty.

462
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,040
Are you going hunting again today?

463
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
You didn't attend the imperial court
meeting yesterday.

464
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,640
How can you not attend the court today?

465
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,680
Huaizhi.

466
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,040
Yes.

467
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,160
Teach your niece how to speak nicely.

468
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,760
Yes.

469
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,440
Your Majesty.

470
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,440
How can you speak with His Majesty
this way?

471
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,520
But we can't let

472
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,760
His Majesty to do ridiculous things.

473
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,200
You...

474
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,400
Your Majesty.

475
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Is Qiu Yanzhi

476
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,560
forcing you to be absent
from the imperial court meeting?

477
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,200
Do you want to learn how to use
the bow and arrow from me?

478
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,440
Ride on my horse.

479
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
I don't want to attend the imperial
court meeting either.

480
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,080
Why?

481
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,320
I can't do anything even if I attend.

482
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
I'd just disappoint the officials.

483
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,160
Instead of disappointing them,

484
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,640
I should just be absent.

485
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,360
That can give them something
to hope for.

486
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,040
It's just like hunting.

487
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
From the start,

488
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,120
if the prey dies from one arrow shot,

489
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,120
then the round will be over.

490
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,280
If the prey

491
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,200
doesn't show up,

492
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,120
then

493
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
you can only patiently wait.

494
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,320
Nice shot.

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,600
So,

496
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,840
as a prey,

497
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,640
do you know what to do now?

498
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,440
If you're not capable enough yet,

499
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,520
hide.

500
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,160
When the hunter is exhausted,

501
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,440
kill him with one shot.

502
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,640
Watch out!

503
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,840
Your Majesty!

504
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,560
Search for the assassin!

505
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,480
Your Majesty.

506
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,280
Are you all right?

507
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,120
Does it hurt?

508
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,000
It hurts because you pushed me.

509
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,600
(Chess of Generals Camp)
There are a total

510
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,920
of 120 guards on duty

511
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,080
on the imperial hunting ground today.

512
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,000
Six of them are suspicious.

513
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,520
They were supposed to be on duty,

514
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,800
or they left in the middle of duty.

515
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,480
I've already ordered them
to continue torturing them.

516
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,560
We'll get an answer soon.

517
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,840
Didn't they fail?

518
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,840
Why do you act like you're faced with
a great enemy?

519
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,240
The assassin's motive
wasn't assassination,

520
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,880
but framing someone.

521
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,400
Who?

522
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,360
Me.

523
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,120
Today, Qi Yan encountered
an assassination attempt,

524
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,800
and I happened to have
no soldiers with me.

525
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,840
It was like I intentionally did that.

526
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,760
Who can it be?

527
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,120
Violet Bureau.

528
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,360
Father has a lot of enemies.

529
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
We can't be careless.

530
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,000
Before 5am,

531
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,240
I want to see the confession.

532
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,320
Also,

533
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,200
eat outside.

534
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,200
Are you going to confess or not?

535
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,400
Tell us!

536
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,680
Your Majesty.

537
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,760
We must thoroughly investigate this.

538
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,760
We can't just let this go.

539
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
It must be Qiu Yanzhi.

540
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,480
This is...

541
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
While you were helping me walk,

542
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,720
I took the opportunity to get it.

543
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,160
There's no poison on this arrow.

544
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,920
There's also no blood groove.

545
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,640
Even if they shot you,

546
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
you won't get seriously injured.

547
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,960
This person

548
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,960
didn't want to kill you.

549
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,080
Then why?

550
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,560
Who knows

551
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,400
that we were going hunting today?

552
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,400
Qiu Yanzhi.

553
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,920
And who

554
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,120
can sneak into the heavily secured

555
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,360
imperial hunting ground?

556
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,040
Those people in
the Chess of Generals Camp.

557
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,760
If I get injured,

558
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,000
who will benefit the most?

559
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,920
Qiu Ziliang.

560
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,080
Your Majesty.

561
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Since we already know the answer,

562
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,720
I'll teach them a lesson now.

563
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,760
It's precisely because the answer

564
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,840
is so obvious

565
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,120
that it's not the answer.

566
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,800
Then...

567
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
If Qiu Ziliang wants
to do anything to me,

568
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,160
he just needs to say it.

569
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
He doesn't need to do this.

570
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,040
There's a big loophole

571
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
in what happened today.

572
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,080
A loophole?

573
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,200
The assassin knows

574
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,880
that I was bringing you
and the Chess Overseer

575
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,280
to go hunting.

576
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
You don't have any strength.

577
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
The Chess Overseer doesn't have
martial arts skills,

578
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
and she has soldiers with her.

579
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
If you were the assassin,

580
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,240
how would you think?

581
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Pretend to be a soldier

582
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,840
and blend into the secret guards.

583
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,880
However,

584
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
Qiu Yanzhi didn't bring any soldiers
with her today.

585
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,640
That's the loophole.

586
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,480
The final objective of this person is

587
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,640
to frame Qiu Yanzhi.

588
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,280
If my guess is right,

589
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,520
if we investigate

590
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,680
who made this arrow,

591
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,880
it must be the Qiu Residence.

592
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,480
Your investigation is done?

593
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,600
They're dead.

594
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,560
What?

595
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,639
The six of them

596
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,400
almost vomited blood at the same time.

597
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,560
They're all dead.

598
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,360
Before we caught them,

599
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,480
they were already poisoned.

600
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,719
What was the poison used?

601
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,679
Common rat poison.

602
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,000
What should we do next?

603
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,600
Wait.

604
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
If it happens once,
it will happen again.

605
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,440
I don't believe that they won't
pull another stunt.

606
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,960
Your Majesty.

607
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm not late, am I?

608
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,080
Your Majesty.

609
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
If you won't attend
the imperial court meeting today,

610
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,199
what do you want to do?

611
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,480
Since that kind of thing
happened yesterday,

612
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
you won't go hunting for foxes again,
will you?

613
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,640
Your Majesty.

614
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,200
How about walking around Heng'an City?

615
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
That's great, Your Majesty.

616
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,160
Then let's eat biángbiáng noodles.

617
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,280
Biángbiáng noodles?

618
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,120
What's that?

619
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,720
Your Majesty has never eaten that?

620
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,600
It's so delicious.

621
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I'll bring you there.

622
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,080
Your Majesty.

623
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,360
Your Majesty.

624
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
Officials.

625
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
His Majesty is busy today.

626
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
You're dismissed!

627
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,800
(Shencai Army's Central Commander,
Wang Lin)

628
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Grandfather.

629
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,920
You must take care

630
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,360
of today's state affairs again.

631
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,440
I

632
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,440
originally thought that after the new
emperor ascends to the throne,

633
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,920
I can have an easier time.

634
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,600
But I didn't expect

635
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,640
that His Majesty would only think
about having fun.

636
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,520
You can't do this.

637
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,160
Move!

638
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,920
Well...

639
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,920
(Imperial edits, Reports)

640
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
(Heng'an)

641
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,240
Sir.

642
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
You have a prestigious status.

643
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,800
You never came to the west of the city.

644
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
That's why you're not aware.

645
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
The most famous food
in the west of the city

646
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,640
is biángbiáng noodles.

647
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,800
After eating one bowl,

648
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,840
you'll be full the whole day.

649
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
You'll have the strength to work.

650
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,200
Where is it then?

651
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
It's everywhere.

652
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,440
But the most famous one is...

653
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,360
Mrs. Li's biángbiáng noodles
from Old East Shop.

654
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
How do you know that?

655
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,360
I have a friend

656
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,640
who's been a glutton
since she was little.

657
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
She loves sneaking out to eat

658
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,280
Mrs. Li's biángbiáng noodles.

659
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
If you can't find her,

660
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,240
just go to Mrs. Li

661
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,960
at the Old East Shop.

662
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,240
She's surely there.

663
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,560
Your friend is an expert.

664
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
But it's not Mrs Li's now.

665
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,640
It's called Cai's Wine Store.

666
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
Then it sells biángbiáng noodles
on the side.

667
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
Why?

668
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,200
Because Mrs. Li

669
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,360
passed away due to an illness.

670
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,920
She had no children,

671
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,600
so she could only

672
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,520
pass on her ultimate skills

673
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,040
to Mrs. Cai next door.

674
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,160
But don't worry.

675
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,880
The flavor

676
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
is still the best in Heng'an city.

677
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,760
Sir.

678
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,560
We're here.

679
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,440
Mrs. Cai, I'm here!

680
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,680
(Cai's Wine Store)

681
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,200
Sir, please come inside.

682
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,960
(Cai's Wine Store)

683
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,120
The noodles are here.

684
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
The noodles are here.

685
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,360
So hot.

686
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,680
Mrs. Cai.

687
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,120
Just place that bowl over there.

688
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,920
Sir. bill, please.

689
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,920
All right.

690
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,040
Sir, this way please.

691
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,720
This is the flavor.

692
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,720
- Go ahead please.
- Aren't these noodles

693
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
the same as botuo?

694
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,240
Botuo?

695
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,080
Botuo is just as wide as a finger.

696
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,920
Two inches in length.

697
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
You won't get your fill when eating it.

698
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,360
This is more like it.

699
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,520
By the way,

700
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,520
do you know

701
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
why it's called biángbiáng noodles?

702
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,640
You don't, right?

703
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,600
I know.

704
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,480
It's because

705
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,920
these noodles and the table

706
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,240
produce a biángbiáng sound when made.

707
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,400
That's why it's called biángbiáng noodles.

708
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,880
Please go ahead.

709
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,720
I see.

710
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,240
Please go ahead.

711
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Please go ahead.

712
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,320
It's not hot anymore.

713
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,760
Here.

714
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,760
All right.

715
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,920
It's not poisoned.

716
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,840
Eat.

717
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,640
Go ahead please.

718
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,000
Since we're outside,

719
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,640
there's no need for courtesy.

720
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
I won't be shy then.

721
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,880
Sir.

722
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,840
You must eat these while they're warm.

723
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,760
Eat.

724
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,120
It won't be good when it's cold.

725
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,760
All right.

726
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,680
What's the matter?

727
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,320
It's too sour.

728
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,600
What the heck is this?

729
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,600
Why aren't you eating too?

730
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
I tried them once.

731
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
I found them sour too,

732
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
so I stopped eating them.

733
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,480
Sir.

734
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,160
Aren't you afraid of the sour flavor?

735
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
I must try it precisely because
I'm afraid of it.
