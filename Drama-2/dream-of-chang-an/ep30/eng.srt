(she is allowed to return

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Announce it.

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,760
Yes.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,040
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
How is this

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,160
going to give me any closure?

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
At least one of us

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
must live.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,400
Before I pass on,

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
I need you

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
to keep me company for a while.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes.

28
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,980
(Duke Chu's Residence)

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
Is Duke Chu's Qihai acupuncture point

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,440
twitching frequently as of late?

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the side effect of taking pills
for martial art training.

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,280
What did you say?

33
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,000
It's the result.

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
It's a great result.

35
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,320
But it's also a great risk.

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,240
I apologize, Master.

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,480
He is unsociable and hence
not very good with manners.

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Those who achieved greatness

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,040
have some weird quirks with them.

40
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,720
He could tell with just a glance.

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,640
That showed just how talented he was.

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
Now that Imperial Physician Shen
is gone,

43
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,400
this man could take this place.

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,480
Sir...

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,240
Don't get up.

46
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Sir.

47
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,960
I seek your just judgment.

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,960
Shi Yuan slaughtered my whole family.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Fool!

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
You've been used as a pawn
without knowing it!

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,120
Tell me,

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,880
the man with a beard

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
that was with you,

54
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,200
who exactly was he?

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
A man with a beard?

56
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Could it be my nephew Yuan Lin?

57
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Sir.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
Did he get into trouble again?

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Sir,

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,160
this is Yuan Lin,

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Yuan Xing's nephew.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
He died during the fight

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,240
at the Shi's Residence.

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
He does look similar
to the Left Advisor.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,840
What do you think?

66
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,360
He may not be involved,

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,640
but those soldiers were murdered
at the Shi's Residence.

68
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Someone must have set them up.

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,840
Indeed.

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
The fighting was a distraction.

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,840
The real motive was murder.

72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,400
I think

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
we should start

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
investigating Jiang Ding.

75
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,240
Jiang Ding introduced Shi Yuan

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
to you.

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
He introduced

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
a murderer.

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Even if there was no ill intention,

80
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,560
it would mean he was incompetent.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,280
Then, we'll start with Jiang Ding.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Yu'er.

84
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Are you feeling better now?

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
When I was

86
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,560
unconscious,

87
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,400
what was Qiu Ziliang up to?

88
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,900
(Duke Chu's Residence)

89
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
Who was it

90
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,720
that worked in the dark

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,880
and slowly consumed

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
the power I possess?

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,920
That is outrageous.

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,120
It seems like Qi Yan's doing,

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
but it's actually someone else.

96
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
That person knows me very well.

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
The person must know
the Chess of Generals Camp

98
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
and the Shencai Army
like the back of their palm.

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
Do you suspect the Chess Overseer?

100
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,800
She let Cheng Xi escape.

101
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
That was how she returned

102
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,400
unscathed.

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,080
It had happened before.

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,120
She told me Cheng Ruoyu

105
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
had gone to Zhaoyi.

106
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
But the truth was,

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,640
Cheng Ruoyu was
meeting with Chen Yintai.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
She thought I didn't know.

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
If it happened once,

110
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
it could be a coincidence.

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
But if it happened again,

112
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,840
too good to be a coincidence.

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to know

114
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,640
if there could be a third coincidence.

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
Understood.

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
I will keep an eye on the Overseer.

117
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,120
However,

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
with all due respect,

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,600
if there is a spy

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,520
within the Camp,

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,560
the Chess Overseer isn't the only suspect.

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
You suspect there are more of them.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,240
I couldn't be sure.

124
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
Come forth.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
Closer.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,880
Tell me.

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
I suspect

128
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,400
the Right Minister.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,640
So I sent the Right Advisor
to follow him.

130
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,159
The Right Advisor and the Right Minister

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
seem very close.

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Indeed.

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,080
But isn't that great?

134
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,799
I'll send the Right Advisor
for this job.

135
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,039
Perhaps you will have a better picture

136
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,040
as to who is the traitor
among our ranks.

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
Or perhaps

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
they are both traitors.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,240
As you expected,

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,880
Eunuch Qiu started suspecting Yanzhi

141
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,120
and you.

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,840
He sent me to spy on you.

143
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
The Right Chariot is spying on Yanzhi.

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
You risked drawing
Eunuch Qiu's suspicion

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,560
just to cover up for Yanzhi.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
But is it worth it?

147
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,800
Your Majesty.

148
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you have a solution?

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,600
Allow me to ponder on it.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
(I can move!)

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm here to change
His Majesty's bandage.

152
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Prince Guang.

153
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
Prince Guang!

154
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
We have orders from Eunuch Qiu.

155
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,560
As a precaution

156
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
against villains such as Shi Yuan

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,920
from assassinating His Majesty,

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
no one can enter

159
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,400
without his permission.

160
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,520
Prince Guang,

161
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,720
please turn back.

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,440
Prince Guang!

163
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,160
Prince Guang!

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,680
Prince Guang!

165
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
Prince Guang!

166
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,840
Yu'er.

167
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Prince Guang!

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
Prince Guang!

169
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,880
Yu'er.

170
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,040
Yu'er.

171
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,840
It's all right, Yu'er.

172
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
Prince Guang has left.

173
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,960
You...

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,000
Yu'er.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
Listen to me.

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll manage.

177
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,080
Likewise.

178
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,440
Yu'er.

179
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
You told me

180
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Shi Yuan recognized Yan Xiu,

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,720
but Yanzhi used some trick

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
to clear Yan Xiu of any suspicion.

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,520
Am I right?

184
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,520
You also said

185
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,440
they failed to swap out

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
the real Madam Cui with their midwife.

187
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,840
But somehow,

188
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
you passed the pregnancy test.

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Yanzhi was just as shocked.

190
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,200
Your Majesty.

191
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
Do you have a plan?

192
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,880
No.

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,640
But...

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,840
But someone else has it.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Who?

196
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,360
The third person.

197
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,760
My aunt?

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,320
No.

199
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
The true third party.

200
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Greetings, sir.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
Is the name list for promotion

202
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,520
ready to be announced?

203
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,920
Grandfather,

204
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,440
these are the candidates we selected.

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,000
Please assess them.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,699
I don't want any mistakes this time.

207
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
I assure you,

208
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
their records are clean.

209
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,880
They will be loyal to you.

210
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,480
It was wise to bring down

211
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,480
His Majesty first.

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
Otherwise, the Shencai Army

213
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
might already be

214
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
under His Majesty's command.

215
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
I know that.

216
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
Rumors are circling lately.

217
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,160
The soldiers are panicking.

218
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Send out my words.

219
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
I appreciate their hard work.

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
They will have three months' worth
of pay as a reward.

221
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,360
We are thankful for the kindness.

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,520
Well,

223
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,320
how is the preparation

224
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,680
for the appointment ceremony?

225
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,080
Prince An's birth mother passed away.

226
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
But the relatives on his mother's side
support him.

227
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,760
(Humble Request from the Officials)
They have contributed much to the cause.

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,560
As of now,

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
half of officials of Imperial Court

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,560
have signed the partition.

231
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,200
What about the other half?

232
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
What about the other half?

233
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,800
Well,

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
as you know,

235
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,280
some civil officials

236
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
are very stubborn.

237
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,440
I don't care what method you employ.

238
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,200
I want their signatures

239
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
before the appointment ceremony

240
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,800
takes place.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Yes.

242
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,680
But

243
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
Cheng Xi is still at large.

244
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,440
I apologize for my manner,

245
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,040
but Cheng Xi is at large,

246
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,360
not to mention she is a skilled warrior

247
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
and cunning.

248
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Prince An's life might be in danger.

249
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,440
It's all right.

250
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,480
I've sent out orders

251
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
to the Chess of Generals Camp.

252
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
They live if Prince An can carry on with his life.

253
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,880
But if he died,

254
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
the whole Camp won't live
to see another day.

255
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,880
I applaud Qiu Ziliang's decision.

256
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,160
Even if

257
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,000
the Right Minister and I betray him,

258
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
we can't make a move on Prince An.

259
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
But he doesn't know

260
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
that we care very little

261
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,600
about Prince An's safety.

262
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
The ceremony would be pointless

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
if Prince An was dead.

264
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,320
Traitors and rebels

265
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
will always be loathed.

266
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
Where are the Zhenwu Army now?

267
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
They have reached Shuozhou.

268
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,280
Shi Yuan

269
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,880
was Qiu Yanzhi's

270
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,280
most important pawn.

271
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
He shouldn't have

272
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,160
been found

273
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
by Qiu Ziliang so easily.

274
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,080
He shouldn't have managed to
infiltrate the palace

275
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
and assassinated me.

276
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Qiu Ziliang used this attack
to retaliate successfully.

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,040
All of these

278
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
were the doing of the third party.

279
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,520
(I don't get it.)

280
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,280
(The person helped us so many times,)

281
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
(so why would he set us up)

282
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,240
(to harm us?)

283
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,160
Collateral damage.

284
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,520
The third party wouldn't want

285
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,960
Qiu Ziliang and I

286
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
to bring each other down.

287
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Who could that be?

288
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,640
We shall wait.

289
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,280
Why must we wait?

290
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
The person won't let me die just yet.

291
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,280
There must be some way to save my life.

292
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,120
That will be our last chance.

293
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
We must make use of it.

294
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,760
The Right Advisor.

295
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,360
You...

296
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm here to help you.

297
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Try to move your body a little.

298
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
Do you feel better?

299
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
What is going on?

300
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
Injuries from a real bone-breaking

301
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
can never be healed.

302
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,040
When I did it to you,

303
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
I didn't use full strength.

304
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,200
But you had to

305
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
suffer great pain.

306
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Get up.

307
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
Why did you do it?

308
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
His Majesty's dying.

309
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,560
No outsider is allowed to come in.

310
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
Only you can save him now.

311
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,440
How?

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
I brought some medicines.

313
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,920
Give it to His Majesty.

314
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
Thank you.

(Duke Chu's Residence)

316
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,640
One with nothing has no fear either.

317
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
Do you get it?

(Misha has been captured)

338
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Great.

339
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,880
Very well.

340
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,120
Yanzhi.

341
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,960
It's Liu Misha.

342
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,600
Has she arrived in Zhenwu?

343
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,440
No.

344
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,920
The Left Chariot captured her.

345
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,760
I want a background check
on the Left Chariot,

346
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,960
and a record of all the tasks

347
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,760
given to him.

348
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,360
I want his full record now.

349
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,880
Yes.

350
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,600
Inform the Zhenwu Army

351
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,320
of Liu Misha's capture.

352
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,840
Ask them to rescue her.

353
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,240
Yes.

354
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,800
One more thing,

355
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,280
inform Qi Yan immediately.

356
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,520
I'll see to it.

357
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
My father sent you to spy on me.

358
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,640
Yes.

359
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,160
Xiu.

360
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,360
From now on,

361
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,080
do not say what you shouldn't say.

362
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,960
Do not go where you shouldn't be.

363
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,200
Do not meet anyone you shouldn't see.

365
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,720
What is it?

366
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
What is the bad news?

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Liu Misha is dead.

368
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,280
In case anything happened,

369
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,280
the Left Chariot brought her head back.

370
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
The Right Minister
is being monitored too.

371
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Eunuch Qiu had sent

372
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,720
the Right Advisor to spy on him.

373
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,000
That was well-played.

374
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,520
Indeed.

375
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,480
If the Right Advisor wishes

376
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,320
to prove she's innocent,

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
she must not let the Right Minister

378
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,040
do what he pleases.

379
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,720
When they are monitored,

380
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
they will be restrained due
to the suspicion

381
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
they draw.

382
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,280
The Right Advisor and the Right Minister

383
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
were in cahoots.

384
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,080
But why would the Right Chariot

385
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,080
want to warn me?

386
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm not sure.

387
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,360
By the way,

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
this is the record on the Left Chariot.

389
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,080
Just as Nine,

390
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,920
his performance has
always been mediocre.

391
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,960
But the Left Minister chose him.

392
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,640
Qiu Ziliang used him for his bidding.

393
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,880
And now he killed Liu Misha,

394
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
ruining my greatest plan.

395
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,560
I miscalculated.

396
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,880
What's done is done.

397
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,480
Blaming yourself won't help us.

398
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,480
We should figure out

399
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,200
a way to stop the appointment ceremony.

400
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Liu Misha is dead.

401
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Li Deyun is trapped inside the house.

402
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,400
The Right Minister and I

403
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,880
are both being monitored.

404
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,120
Qi Yan is of no use to anyone.

405
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,960
How ironic.

406
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
I thought I had total control

407
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,240
over the Chess of Generals Camp.

408
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
But as it turned out,

409
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,640
Qiu Ziliang could easily

410
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,440
remove anyone

411
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,520
on a whim.

412
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,520
One last sip.

413
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,840
Your Majesty.

414
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,400
How do you feel now?

415
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,640
Do you feel better?

416
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,040
What about you?

417
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,080
Me?

418
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,440
I...

419
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
I consider it a blessing in disguise.

420
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
I feel as though I was reborn.

421
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,360
I could take on ten soldiers in the past.

422
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,600
Now I could take on a whole battalion.

423
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,520
Your Majesty.

424
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,560
You must get well soon.

425
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,840
Duke Chu arrives!

426
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,440
Your Majesty.

427
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
How do you feel

428
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
over the past few days?

429
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,680
Your Majesty.

430
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,200
The appointment ceremony
is three days from now.

431
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm afraid Your Majesty

432
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,760
is in no shape to attend it.

433
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,040
But fear not,

434
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,600
I'll be there.

435
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,920
I'll make sure

436
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
everything goes well.

437
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,120
By the way,

438
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
except for Li Deyun,

439
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,320
all the officials of the Imperial Court

440
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,760
have signed a petition

441
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,960
to make Prince An the next Emperor.

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,960
The officials have united as one.

443
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,160
There's no threat within our ranks.

444
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
As for external threats,

445
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Your Majesty,

446
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
the Zhenwu Army

447
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,160
has been stopped in Shuozhou

448
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,920
by the Shencai Army I sent.

449
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
As for Princess Misha,

450
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,240
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,520
She died.

452
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
Speaking of her,

453
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
I must admit Princess Misha
was rather resilient.

454
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,720
She was rumored dead many times.

455
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,640
But this time,

456
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,880
I ordered my men

457
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,760
to severe her head as evidence.

458
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,440
She is dead through and through.

459
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,640
I

460
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
understood.

461
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Qi Yan.

462
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
Don't you

463
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,240
have anything else

464
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,760
to tell me?

465
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,440
Godfather.

466
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
Congratulations.

467
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,640
For what?

468
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,600
Forget it.

469
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,760
Rest well and heal.

470
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
As long as I'm around,

471
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,280
it will all get better.

472
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,800
I must take my leave now.

473
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Have you decided?

474
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,960
As Official Qiu told us,

475
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,280
if Prince An died,

476
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,360
everyone must die with him.

477
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
If Prince An died,

478
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,000
it would only take him half a year
to appoint another crown prince.

479
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,920
If he lost the Chess of Generals Camp,

480
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,320
it would take at least five years
to rebuild it.

481
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
He is very well aware

482
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
of the cost.

483
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,400
However,

484
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
the Right Chariot
is still monitoring us.

485
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,800
Let's find out

486
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,400
if he could stop us.

487
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,920
Your Majesty.

488
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,840
Yu'er.

489
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,840
The third party

490
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,040
failed to bring down Qiu Ziliang.

491
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,600
I

492
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,080
need a favor from you.

493
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,800
Your Majesty,

494
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
are you asking for my help

495
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
as a ruler?

496
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,800
If so,

497
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,440
your wish

498
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,600
is my command.

499
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,800
You don't need a favor from me.

500
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
I asked as a friend.

501
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm asking you

502
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
as a friend who fought by your side

503
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,560
and went through life
and death with you.

504
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,000
I cannot accept your request.

505
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Do you know what I want to ask of you?

506
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,400
I know what you're going to say.

507
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,440
Your Majesty,

508
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,440
you want to see Prince An.

509
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
Yes.

510
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,520
I want to talk to Prince An.

511
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,960
But it's not what you think it is.

512
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,800
What do you think

513
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,840
I am thinking, Your Majesty?

514
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
You must think

515
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,120
Misha's death has left me with
no other options.

516
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,200
If I retaliate

517
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,000
by killing Prince An

518
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
and prevent his coronation,

519
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,600
then

520
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,600
I

521
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,240
might extend my life a little.

522
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,480
Am I right?

523
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,640
No.

524
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,080
The Emperor I know

525
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,520
would never want

526
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,960
to hurt his own brother.

527
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,000
So why are you stopping me?

528
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,760
You are too weak to do so.

529
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,520
Qiu Ziliang won't allow it either.

530
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,480
You saved me.

531
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,560
I will hold on.

532
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,200
So

533
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
don't let my effort be in vain.

534
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,200
Very well.

535
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,800
I beg of you.

536
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,200
No.

537
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,960
If anything happens on your way

538
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,400
to meet Prince An,

539
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,040
I will hate myself
for the rest of my life.

540
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,480
You have my word.

541
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,960
Nothing bad

542
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
will happen to me.

543
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,840
What if

544
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,480
Qiu Ziliang finds out?

545
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,320
Before the appointment ceremony,

546
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,840
he will not take the risk

547
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,480
of doing me further harm.

548
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
But what happens next?

549
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,400
Since Liu Misha is dead,

550
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,080
Zhenwu is lost.

551
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,560
I have no other options left.

552
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,960
After the appointment ceremony,

553
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
there is no future for me.

554
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,920
Yu'er,

555
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,320
I must meet with Prince An.

556
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
Tonight will be

557
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,280
my last chance to see him.

558
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,560
Please, I beg of you.

559
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
Please help me.

560
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,800
You're the person

561
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
I trust the most

562
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,320
and the one I rely on.

563
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,320
I need your help.

564
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,400
I'm begging you.

565
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,920
Your Majesty.

566
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,960
Please hang in there.

567
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,080
We'll be there soon.

568
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,199
Very well.

569
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,440
Yu'er.

570
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,880
What is it?

571
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,440
It's nothing.

572
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,720
Let's move on.

573
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,360
Watch your steps.

574
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,140
(Chess of Generals Camp)

575
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,440
For Prince An's safety,

576
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Eunuch Qiu doubled the security.

577
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,320
Must you go on your own?

578
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,120
I should go instead.

579
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,760
No.

580
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,160
Walking right into the place

581
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,640
will not draw suspicion.

582
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,600
Are you looking for Right Chariot?

583
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,680
I checked.

584
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
He's not around.

585
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Wait.

586
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,320
The Right Chariot?

587
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,320
I don't think so.

588
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,160
They will get themselves killed.

589
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,080
Stop them.

590
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,800
Yes.

591
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,320
Can't you wait for another three days?

592
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
Do you have a death wish?

593
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
His Majesty wished

594
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,080
to have a word with Prince An.

595
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I tried to stop him,

596
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
but His Majesty insisted on it.

597
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,120
So we came.

598
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,720
Why are you there?

599
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,040
We are there for the same reason.

600
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,360
No.

601
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,480
You went there

602
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,440
for a different reason.

603
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,600
Didn't Your Majesty plan
to kill Prince An?

604
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,480
You wanted to kill Prince An.

605
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,080
Why?

606
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,920
To save you.

607
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,800
Don't bother.

608
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
I must.

609
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
I've run out of options.

610
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,560
No.

611
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
If Prince An is killed,

612
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,440
you will rise to prominence.

613
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,360
My father managed

614
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
to convince the Imperial Court

615
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,160
into accepting Prince An's coronation

616
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,520
not because of his
threats and influence,

617
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,760
but because of the family
of Prince An's mother.

618
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,200
They have wealth

619
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,400
and network.

620
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,520
If it were the other princes,

621
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,320
it wouldn't go as smoothly.

622
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,440
Which is why

623
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,520
there won't be

624
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
another Emperor for some time

625
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,440
after Prince An is killed.

626
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
You can extend your life.

627
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,560
Your Majesty.

628
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:10,761
I doubt he'll live much longer.

629
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,680
I must

630
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,960
talk to Prince An.

631
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,440
As you saw just now,

632
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
the place was heavily guarded.

633
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,680
I know you have a way

634
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,600
to save Prince An.

635
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,840
I must

636
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,520
talk to Prince An.

637
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,600
Please help me

638
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,320
see him one more time.

639
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,960
Yanzhi,

640
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,640
please.

641
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,520
Sir.

642
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,440
What is it now?

643
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,040
The Chess Overseer has requested

644
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,520
for permission to let His Majesty

645
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
meet with Prince An.

646
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Permission granted.

647
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,240
Yes.

648
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,840
Come.

649
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,640
I wouldn't dare.

650
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
When I told you to sit,

651
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,600
just sit.

652
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,600
Yes.

653
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
There are only

654
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,800
the two of us here.

655
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,880
This reminds me

656
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,800
of the night the late emperor
passed away.

657
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,200
He also requested

658
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,640
to meet Qi Yan one last time.

659
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,760
I granted him the wish.

660
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
Do you know why I did it?

661
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
Because

662
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,480
you were giving him

663
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,640
one final chance.

664
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,960
Indeed.

665
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,200
If the late emperor killed Qi Yan,

666
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,840
I would be furious as well.

667
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,760
But I would respect him

668
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,880
for his greatness.

669
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,400
For he had

670
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,440
the founding father's character.

671
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,560
Brother!

672
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,880
Qi Rong.

673
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,840
Rise.

674
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,360
Brother.

675
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,320
Please, I beg of you.

676
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,520
Don't take my life.

677
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,120
Brother.

678
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,160
Brother, I didn't

679
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,120
want to come back.

680
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,680
It was Cheng Xi who brought me back.

681
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,640
Soon afterward,

682
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,880
the Godfather made me the Crown Prince.

683
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,560
I never asked for any of these.

684
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,800
It doesn't matter.

685
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,880
Brother.

686
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,920
Brother.

687
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,640
Are you

688
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,880
not mad at me?

689
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,000
I only came

690
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,200
because I have three questions for you.

691
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
They are the same questions

692
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,520
the late emperor

693
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,200
asked me before passing on.

694
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,800
What are they?

695
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,640
The first question,

696
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,600
can you take care of yourself?

697
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,200
Yes.

698
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,760
I can.
