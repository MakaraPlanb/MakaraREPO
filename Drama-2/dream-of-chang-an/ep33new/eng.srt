=Episode 33=

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,040
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,920
I can assassinate Zhang Jiang.

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
The situation is different.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
On the surface,

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,000
Lucong was awaiting
our appointment last time.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Chen Yintai didn't
know your background.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,680
So your investigation went well.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
But this time,

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Zhang Jiang is wary of us.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
A solo mission

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,120
will not work.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,960
Is there a solution?

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
Please tell me if you have one.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll do whatever I can to accomplish it.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,600
(If she's really
a child of a loyal official killed)

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
(during the Morning Dew Rebellion...)

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,640
Your Majesty?

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,600
Your Majesty?

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,280
I plan to send Zhang Zhongru to Lucong

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,800
to quell the rebellion.

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
But resolving the rebellion alone
won't be enough.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,960
We need

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,880
another way out.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
Such as?

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,880
Mobilizing the troops
from different regions.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,400
Do you plan to request troops

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,160
from the military commissioners?

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Yes.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
The prefectures are almost autonomous.

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,080
Yet, they have not launched a revolt.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
One, they are wary of Qiu Ziliang.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
Two, they are wary of each other.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,960
If Lucong

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
gains the upper hand now,

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
the military commissioners will be

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
very anxious.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,840
So there is a great chance

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
they will help us.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
But Qiu Ziliang

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
will never let
the military commissioners

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,360
unite

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,520
and work for me.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
He will do anything to stop us.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,880
This is no time for
his petty squabbling!

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
We are losing the country!

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
He's nothing

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
but a eunuch.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,640
For him,

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,240
anyone can be the Emperor.

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Setting up the throne for a grunt

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
might be more beneficial to him.

67
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,160
When officials can't
accept the Emperor,

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
it's easier for him to control
the Imperial Court.

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Don't be upset.

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,440
It's not fair for you, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm not upset.

72
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,560
I feel upset for you.

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
The whole world thinks

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
you seized the throne for yourself.

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,000
That is far from the truth.

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,000
Qiu Ziliang

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
gained too much power from

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,000
the late emperor.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
He rose to this threat.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
And Your Majesty

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
must now clean up after the mess.

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
No one would want

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
to take over this mess.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Yu'er.

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,840
Thank you.

86
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,280
This is my duty.

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't need your gratitude.

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,520
(If all the perils of the past)

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
(are to pave the path to meet you,)

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,840
Thank you.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
(when you finally find out)

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
(I am the culprit who had
brought you suffering,)

93
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,840
(I won't mind)

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
(paying for the sins)

95
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
(of my past.)

96
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,320
Did you

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
let Zhang Jiang in?

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,000
He's set this plan into motion.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
That was quick.

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,200
It was really your doing.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,000
You ordered your men to send
me to the border

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,320
so I could be exiled.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
I had no choice but to tell Zhang Jiang

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,160
that the disturbance in Heng'an

106
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,520
was his chance to strike.

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
Your father's mutiny

108
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
never came to fruition.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,360
Your whole family was punished.

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,760
Your mother was sent to the palace

111
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
to serve as Grand Empress
Dowager Guo's handmaiden.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,880
She faced great humiliation.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,680
Humiliation?

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
She made it through
and became a consort.

115
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,120
She didn't have a choice.

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,520
She did so to survive.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
She didn't deserve to live!

118
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
She could have sacrificed her life
for the burial.

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,840
Her husband died.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,760
If she was loyal to him,

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
she would have died by his side!

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,160
That shameless woman pandered
to her enemy and gave birth to you!

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Thirteen.

124
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,040
Thirteen, you got it all wrong.

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
I meant no offense.

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
You know what I meant.

127
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
After my father died,

128
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,200
I was homeless.

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
I was alone and lost.

130
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
When I found out you were born,

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
I felt joy in my heart.

132
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,960
All that I've done

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
was to avenge my father

134
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,320
and retake what was rightfully his.

135
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,560
I was doing it for you!

136
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
You have great qualities.

137
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,120
You are more outstanding

138
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
than Qi Yan and Prince An.

139
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,920
You should rule Xing empire instead!

140
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't forget,

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
the posthumous edict clearly states

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,880
you are the heir to the throne.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
You are the rightful Emperor.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,720
Qi Yan and his ilk are all traitors
of our nation!

145
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
Yuan Du!

146
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes.

147
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
You may set out now.

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Thirteen!

149
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
She can't fight.

150
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,200
I doubt she could escape again.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,720
What?

152
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
What did you do to me?

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,280
You should never have instigated

154
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
the rebellion in Lucong.

155
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Our land

156
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,280
must not be desecrated.

157
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
My homeland

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
must never be taken.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
My family name

160
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
must never be tainted.

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Scoundrel!

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
I will never forgive you!

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,720
This is unforgivable!

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,360
More guards have come.

165
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Qiu Ziliang is worried

166
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,680
you might try to retaliate.

167
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,240
Just as I expected.

168
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
What should we do then?

169
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
Without Your Majesty's written command
and Commander's Seal,

170
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
how does Official Li
mobilize the troops?

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,960
My written command and
the Commander's Seal

172
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,680
might not do us any good.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,960
At least we could request
with righteous authority.

174
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
We could persuade them with reasons

175
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
and interests.

176
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
This plan could work.

177
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
What's so funny?

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
You've been smiling very often lately.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
I feel happy when I'm with you.

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
I smile because I'm happy.

181
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,080
Now is not the time to flirt.

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,160
Come.

183
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,920
Yu'er,

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,480
lie down with me.

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,880
But...

186
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Just do it.

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
I shall put up with your tantrum

188
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,520
and lie down for a little.

189
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Yu'er.

190
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,200
Do you really want to help me?

191
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,280
Certainly.

192
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
There is a way

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
you might not approve of.

194
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
I will.

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll agree with whatever plan

196
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,200
you come up with.

197
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,040
Are you sure?

198
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm sure.

199
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
Then leave.

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
What?

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,400
Leave me.

202
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,760
Leave Heng'an.

203
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
I will never do such a thing.

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
This is the one plan
I can never agree with.

205
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
I won't leave you behind.

206
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,640
We don't know Han Ding's whereabouts.

207
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,360
What would you do without me?

208
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
But the turmoil will end,

209
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,120
and the people will survive.

210
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,640
(Zhenwu)

211
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,713
(Yuzhou)
(The Land of Daxing)

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
Cheng Xi

213
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
is always so restless.

214
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,520
Indeed.

215
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,640
Her plan was cruel.

216
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,640
She is pitting Duke Chu,

217
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Qi Yan,

218
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,640
and us

219
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
against

220
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,240
mortal enemies.

221
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
How should we retaliate?

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,320
No.

223
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm not an expert in leading an army.

224
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,400
I should wait and observe

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
rather than

226
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
trying to be smart.

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
(Herbal remedy)

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
Have you found anything

229
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,840
on the divine healer?

230
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,880
Yes.

231
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,160
His family name is Wu.

232
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,360
He came from Fengxing.

233
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
He has no friends or family.

234
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,880
He lives in solitude.

235
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,960
For the past decade,

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
he wandered the land

237
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,760
and helped people.

238
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,960
Money doesn't interest him.

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,160
He's saved many lives.

240
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,360
He said

241
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
Qi Yan was doomed.

242
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,200
That was what he told Duke Chu.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
(Herbal remedy)

244
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
Interesting.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,560
What is it?

246
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
The Right Chariot got a divine healer

247
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,800
who awakened

248
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
Yuan Xing from his coma.

249
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Does our mighty and brilliant

250
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
Right Minister

251
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,160
know about this?

252
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,360
I doubt he does.

253
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,640
If he was unaware of this,

254
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
how would he know to prepare

255
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,000
the rosa rubus?

256
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,800
After Yuan Xing came to,

257
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
he gulled Yuan Xing into

258
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,720
changing the statement.

259
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,040
Could this divine healer

260
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,160
actually...

261
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
If the Right Minister

262
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
is Prince Guang's double,

263
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
it's totally possible

264
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
that our divine healer

265
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
is working for the Right Minister.

266
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
How is His Majesty's injury?

267
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,720
The brat you handpicked

268
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,880
has outstanding qualities.

269
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
I was left impressed.

270
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,320
His Majesty will live.

271
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
So,

272
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,040
what should I do next?

273
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,880
Wait.

274
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,480
Wait?

275
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,200
When the rebellion in Lucong is ended,

276
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
we will set our plan into motion.

277
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,440
It's been ten years.

278
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
I've been waiting for so long.

279
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,920
Senior,

280
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,840
I had let you down.

Listen to me.

289
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,040
First,

290
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,000

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,720
Move aside.

308
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,480
Let's see who dares to stop me.

309
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
Grand Empress Dowager.

310
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,960
Grandmother.

311
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,520
What brought you here?

312
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't you know?

313
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
All of you have been

314
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,200
keeping secrets from me.

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,280

about the situation,

319
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,720
I would be kept in the dark!

320
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,280
Your Majesty.

321
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,640
You are hurt so badly.

322
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,440

323
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,640

324
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280

the Qi family's bloodline!

326
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,200
Please mind your words.

327
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,079
I'll speak my mind.

328
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,280
I do not fear him.

329
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
Rong is dead.

330
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,680
If you died,

331
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
I would die with you.

332
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
Grandmother, please calm down.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,119
That was uncalled for.

334
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,960
Lowly servant!

335
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,240
It's your fault!

336
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,080
His Majesty

337
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,600
was hurt because of you!

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
But Yu'er is not responsible

339
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
for all of my misfortunes.

340
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,880
Listen to yourself.

341
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,240
Why are you still defending her?

342
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
I've heard the rumors.

343
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
You got hurt while saving

344
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,800
this lowly servant.

345
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
You are the ruler of a country!

346
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,360
She should take a knife for you,

347
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
not the other way around.

348
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
Yu'er also saved my life.

349
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,600
But from what I see now,

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,560
she is still alive and well.

351
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,360
But you?

352
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,080
My grandson

353
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,920
could barely stand straight.

354
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
The Grand Empress Dowager is right.

355
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
I deserve the worst punishments.

356
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,440
Is the child

357
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,360
safe?

358
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,560
She miscarried.

359
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
So why are you still keeping her around?

360
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,760
Banish her from this palace!

361
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,000
Get out!

362
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
Grandmother, please calm down.

363
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
Yu'er was heavily wounded.

364
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,360
She is still recovering.

365
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,600
Not to mention

366
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,880
I need

367
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
a servant to tend to my needs.

368
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,640
I hope you understand.

369
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,640
Any other servant will do just fine.

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
Cheng Ruoyu

371
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
must not be allowed

372
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,760
to serve you any longer.

373
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,560
Do you feel no shame
while staying in this palace?

374
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,560
Yu'er.

375
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Yan'er.

376
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,680
Do you wish to make me worry?

377
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,200
Send her out of palace.

378
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,320
Do not allow her to return.

379
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,960
Yu'er.

380
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,400
At the moment,

381
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm grounded in this cage.

382
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,840
I must find a way

383
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
to get you out of here.

384
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,880
I'm not leaving.

385
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
The most logical plan

386
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,400
is

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,560
the Grand Empress Dowager
to be upset with you

388
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,280
and banish you.

389
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,360
Please don't chase me away.

390
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Please.

391
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,640
Silly.

392
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,120
I would never chase you away.

393
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,840
But listen to me.

394
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,120
I need you

395
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
to stop crying.

396
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240
It pains me to see you cry.

397
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
Yu'er, don't cry.

398
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
I'm asking you to leave

399
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,080
because I know

400
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,440
my safety

401
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
is your utmost concern.

402
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,000
And that's because I'm the Emperor.

403
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,680
Since I'm the Emperor,

404
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,840
I must live up to this title.

405
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,040
What is the first rule of

406
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,600
the Violet Bureau?

407
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,560
My heart is like a sword,

408
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
suppressing the wicked
and eliminating evil.

409
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,480
My sword is like my heart,

410
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,760
protecting the nation
and being loyal to the emperor.

411
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,800
Good.

412
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,040
So now

413
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
I need you to be loyal.

414
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Would there be a problem?

415
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,120
After you're banished from the palace,

416
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,840
Qiu Ziliang will send his henchmen
to spy on you.

417
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,640
You will be in great danger.

418
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,880
But I believe

419
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,600
you can handle any peril

420
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,680
that comes to you.

421
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,480
I will.

422
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,240
I still want to come back alive.

423
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,160
As long as you live,

424
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,720
I'll live.

425
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,800
For Your Majesty to live on,

426
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,120
I will make it through.

427
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,720
We will both live.

428
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
You came just in time.

429
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,040
Take your bow back.

430
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,320
It's right over there.

431
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,080
Help yourself.

432
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Your Majesty.

433
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,320
What is the meaning of this?

434
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
Grandmother.

435
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,840
Grandmother, you chased my servant away.

436
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,640
I am chasing out yours.

437
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
It's only fair.

438
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,840
Am I right?

439
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
The Grand Empress Dowager

440
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,680
chased away the Little Fish.

441
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,240
Sir,

442
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,320
that's what Eunuch Gao said.

443
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,960
He suspects it could be a trick.

444
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,080
The Grand Empress Dowager
never shows it,

445
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,160
but she cares a lot about Qi Yan.

446
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,720
She may hate Cheng Ruoyu,
but she wouldn't

447
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,520
separate the two

448
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,720
while he's wounded.

449
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,240
So to answer your doubt,

450
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,240
the Little Fish is out on a mission.

451
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,760
Am I right?

452
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,840
He's still not giving up.

453
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,480
A bad move.

454
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
I meant Cheng Ruoyu's leaving.

455
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,520
You startled me.

456
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,800
I thought

457
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
it was me.

458
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,040
Do you mean

459
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,680
how the Grand Empress Dowager

460
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,520
chased her out?

461
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,280
She is good at qinggong kungfu

462
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,080
and not to mention clever.

463
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
What kind of mission would you
send her on?

464
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,360
To deliver a message.

465
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,800
What kind of message

466
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,400
would require you to send
your most trusted servant?

467
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,800
A secret edict.

468
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
As we can tell by now,

469
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,280
His Majesty has a plan

470
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
to deal with Lucong's disturbance.

471
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,280
The plan

472
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,800
must never be known to Qiu Ziliang.

473
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
So he and Cheng Ruoyu

474
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
put up an act

475
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,880
to get her out of the palace.

476
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
Brilliant.

477
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,920
I think

478
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
it's folly.

479
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
If I can figure it out,

480
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,480
so can Qiu Ziliang.

481
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,080
It's almost impossible

482
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,120
for Cheng Ruoyu to accomplish

483
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,680
the mission alone.

484
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,000
Everyone is wary of me.

485
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,880
I can't afford to draw any attention.

486
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
How is the arrangement
with the Shencai Army?

487
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,240
The newly-promoted generals
have their own ideas.

488
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,120
And since they lack experience,
the soldiers

489
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,000
aren't convinced.

490
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,360
The grassroots are complaining.

491
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,800
Do not miss this opportunity.

492
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
While Qiu Ziliang

493
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
has his hands full with
Cheng Xi and Cheng Ruoyu,

494
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
we can begin

495
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,760
our operation.

496
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,480
Yes.

497
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
What was that?

498
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,840
Say it again.

499
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,240
It's the Commander's Seal.

500
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Eunuch Gao said

501
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,200
the Commander's Seal was missing.

502
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,360
Understood.

503
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
Dismiss.

504
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,440
Yes.

505
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
The command over the Shencai Army

506
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,480
is in your hands.

507
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
Should we obey His Majesty's order
of mobilization?

508
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,160
No.

509
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,480
In that case,

510
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,240
why are you worried, sir?

511
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,240
The Xing empire

512
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
has more than just the Shencai Army,

513
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,720
is that clear?

514
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,720
Are you worried

515
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,400
local troops such as
the Zhaoyi Army would...

516
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,040
How about this?

517
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,920
Lead your soldiers
and go after the Little Fish.

518
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,960
Find out what her mission is.

519
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,240
Keep me posted.

520
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes.

521
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,103
(Li's Residence)

522
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:29,712
(Li's Residence)

523
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,239
(Li's Residence)

524
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
Beauty Cheng.

525
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,680
This is a strange outfit to put on
in the middle of the night.

526
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,280
What's the matter?

527
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,280
Are you planning to cause me trouble?

528
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:03,920
Sir.

529
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,960
The fire is in the direction

530
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,920
of the Shencai Army's camp.

531
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,720
Go check it out.

532
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,360
Yes.

533
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,200
Leave.

534
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,000
Tell me,

535
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,360
what are you looking for?

536
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,840
Where is the Commander's Seal?

537
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
What is that?

538
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
Drop the act.

539
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,720
I know you have it.

540
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Hand it over.

541
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,240
I have no idea what it is.

542
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,200
I've never seen

543
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
the Commander's Seal.

544
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,920
So why are you at

545
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,440
Li Deyun's house?

546
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm here for Li Zening.

547
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,440
Had she

548
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,760
not ratted me out,

549
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,640
I wouldn't have been

550
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,720
banished from the palace.

551
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
Do I look like

552
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,760
a mindless infant to you?

553
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,360
If you don't believe it,

554
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,160
there is nothing I can do.

555
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,800
Search as you please.

556
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,160
Father.

557
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,720
Father!

558
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,240
Father!

559
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
There is a mutiny in the Shencai Army.

560
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,760
So you're the decoy.

561
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,120
The Commander's Seal

562
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
was stolen from the palace.

563
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
Only Beauty Cheng

564
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,080
could come and go freely

565
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,560
from His Majesty's room.

566
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,880
Guards.

567
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,320
Arrest Beauty Cheng.

568
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,520
Yanzhi.

569
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,280
Make sure you interrogate her properly.

570
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,080
Yes.

571
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,000
What was the mutiny for?

572
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,960
Have a guess.

573
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,640
You arranged it.

574
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,160
How else

575
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,880
could I help you escape?

576
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,840
So you know.

577
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,720
Your beloved aunt invited the hyena.

578
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,600
That leaves His Majesty
with two options.

579
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,200
He could mobilize the Shencai Army
to fend off the enemies,

580
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,360
or mobilize the local troops.

581
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
Qiu Ziliang will never hand over

582
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,680
his command over the Shencai Army.

583
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,680
So

584
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,640
His Majesty is left with one option.

585
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,440
You got it all right.

586
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,880
You need the Commander's Seal
to mobilize the troops.

587
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
His Majesty is trapped in the palace.

588
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,760
So someone must smuggle
the Commander's Seal out.

589
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
Hence,

590
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,520
the Grand Empress Dowager

591
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,600
put up an act with you.

592
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,560
She banished you from the palace.

593
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,240
That tricked

594
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
Qiu Ziliang into believing

595
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,680
you have the Commander's Seal.

596
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
He would stop you at all cost.

597
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360
But the real Commander's Seal

598
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,120
was already in Li Deyun's hand.

599
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,480
Have a guess.

600
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,280
Who took away

601
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,159
the real Commander's Seal?

602
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,239
It's no doubt your dear rival

603
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,639
Li Zening's doing.

604
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,560
Father.

605
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,800
I made you some soup.

606
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,000
You should have some food.

607
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm in no mood to eat anything.

608
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
I may have

609
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,400
the Commander's Seal,

610
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,679
but what comes next

611
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,240
will be even more challenging.

612
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,040
Do you think

613
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,120
it's impossible to mobilize the troops?

614
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,160
It's not impossible.

615
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,200
But we lack the talent.

616
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,560
Talent?

617
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,520
These military commissioners

618
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
are all cunning and greedy.

619
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
A mere seal won't be enough

620
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,600
to mobilize their soldiers.

621
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,640
To make them obey the order,

622
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,720
we need to allure them with benefits.

623
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,160
We must make them fear the authority.

624
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,040
And also...

625
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,480
a leader to manage them.

626
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,600
We lack the person

627
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,760
for this task.

628
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,442

(is in Li Deyun's hand.)

635
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,320
(if Yu'er managed to escape?)

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,000
(I hope the item in this case)

637
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,280

You are right.

652
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,000
I showed up

653
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,920
to act as a decoy

654
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
to lure Qiu Ziliang's attention.

655
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,840
The real Commander's Seal

656
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,120
was handed to Li Deyun

657
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
by his daughter.

658
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,160
Such folly.

659
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,600
Whether it was folly or not,

660
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
Qiu Ziliang

661
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,280
has already fallen for it.

662
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,720
And you are captured

663
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,880
yet again.

664
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,160
I still have a lifesaver.

665
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
Not to mention

666
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,920
I have you save my skin.

667
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,680
You put a lot of faith in me.

668
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760
But you're wrong.

669
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,200
If you fell into his hands,

670
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,040
you would have a chance to escape.

671
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,480
But he handed you to me.

672
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,680
To avoid suspicion,

673
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,040
I can never let you escape.

674
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
You just told me

675
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,720
you would help me get out.

676
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,080
That was the original plan.

677
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,320
But changes had to be made.

678
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,240
It doesn't matter.

679
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,320
I chose this path,

680
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,440
so life and death

681
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,600
are no longer my concern.

682
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Yanzhi.

683
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,200
Whether you could
help me get out or not,

684
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,920
I still appreciate the favor.

685
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,520
Yu'er.

686
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,920
Are you willing to serve me from now on?

687
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,840
I can help His Majesty

688
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
end the rebellion in Lucong.

689
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,840
I can help him secure his authority.

690
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,960
He will not be at Qiu Ziliang's mercy.

691
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,360
But in return,

692
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,920
after the rebellion ends,

693
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,400
you must surrender yourself to me.

694
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,440
You will serve me and do my bidding.

695
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,600
I...

696
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,080
Don't turn me down just yet.

697
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Ponder on it

698
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,320
when you get back.

699
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,880
I don't get it.

700
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
There are plenty of outstanding people
in the Chess of Generals Camp.

701
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,600
You're not short on subordinates.

702
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,560
Why would you choose me instead?

703
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
There are plenty of soldiers,

704
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
but brilliant officers are rare.

705
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,600
And I am

706
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,240
very fond of you.

707
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,520
He holds a fly-whisk.

708
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,160
Eunuch Qiu.

709
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,400
Are you the troublemaker?

710
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,800
It was me.

711
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,760
But

712
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,080
I wasn't causing trouble.

713
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,920
I merely want an explanation.

714
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
What is it?

715
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
Since spring,

716
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
our pay has been delayed

717
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,000
by our superiors.

718
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,400
Winter is coming.

719
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,000
My men's sweaters

720
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,960
are old and torn.

721
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,800
Our families

722
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,880
are waiting for us

723
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,960
to send them money for New Year.

724
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
I have recently

725
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,600
ordered to reward you

726
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
three months' worth of pay.

727
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,440
We got nothing,

728
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,760
not even a penny!

729
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,320
We got nothing!

730
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,120
Yes! We didn't even get a coin!

731
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,760
Not even a penny!

732
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,120
What is going on here?

733
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,360
I'll deal with you later.

734
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,000
Scram.

735
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,960
So what is it that you seek now?

736
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,800
We want our pay!

737
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,360
We want our pay!

738
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,560
Anything else?

739
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,920
We want a bonus.

740
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,120
We want a bonus!

741
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,120
The rice price doubled over the years.

742
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,360
Why are we getting paid less

743
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,120
every year?

744
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,640
Bad news!

745
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,000
Bad news!

746
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,040
Bad news!

747
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,600
They are dead!

748
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,760
The Assistant Generals

749
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,440
left in the camp

750
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,200
were all murdered!

751
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,320
Who could have done it?

752
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,960
What is going on now?

753
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,760
Now,

754
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,720
we did it because we were

755
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
out of options.

756
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,960
We only

757
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,840
tied them up.

758
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
We didn't slaughter them.

759
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,880
Sir,

760
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,240
please don't punish us

761
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,120
