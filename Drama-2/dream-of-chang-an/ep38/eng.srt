14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,840
Chess Overseer.

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Did you find a good weapon?

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Not yet.

17
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
It's Double Cannons.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,920
They're back?

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,120
Didn't they go to protect Ling Ling?

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
Why are they only back today?

21
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,520
In Lucong,

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,120
Ling Ling instructed them to stay
and find Cheng Xi.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
You may go.

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,720
I didn't expect

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
that Cheng Xi would lose
her martial arts skill.

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,240
So what?

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
They still didn't capture her,

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
and she escaped.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Why did Cheng Xi go to Lucong?

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,400
She went there to find Yu'er?

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
It's impossible for her to know

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,480
that Ling Ling is Yu'er,

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
so she must have gone there
because of Zhang Jiang.

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,400
She wanted to use Lucong's troops
to return to the capital.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,880
But she didn't expect

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,880
that Zhang Zhongru
would be so powerful.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
He easily killed

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
Zhang Jiang.

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,400
You're worried

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
that she won't give up

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,360
and will continue to rebel?

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,640
I'm just worried

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,000
that she'll see Ling Ling

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
and tell her what she shouldn't.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
Now, Ling Ling

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
still loves Qi Yan.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
If she finds out about her identity now,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
that will only ruin things.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,080
So this secret

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
must continue to be kept.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,320
Until Qi Yan dies.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
The Morning Dew Rebellion started

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
because of Qiu Ziliang.

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,680
But Qi Yan was also his accomplice.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
He can't absolve himself from it.

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Both of them

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
are obsessed with power.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
Madam Cai.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,640
Without knowing it,

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,960
it's your death anniversary already.

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,839
Madam Cai.

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,120
Don't be angry.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
I know that it's my mistake.

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,520
That day,

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
I had no choice

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,040
when I asked Ziyuan to kill you.

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
This year,

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I always dream...

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
I always dream about you.

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,760
When will you

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
be able to forgive me,

73
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Madam Cai?

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,240
Kill Cheng Xi

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
to avenge me.

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
Who's talking?

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Who's there?

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Who's talking?

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
Madam Cai.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Is it you?

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Just answer.

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,840
Will you kill her or not?

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,480
No.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
No.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,600
No.

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,880
I can't.

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't.

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
I can't.

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,760
Li Rong.

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,440
Madam.

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,920
You...

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
It's you.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
You're great.

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,360
I didn't misplace my trust in you.

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
I can't go out now.

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,640
Go and inform Yanzhi

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
to be lenient

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
while she stops it.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll do it myself.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't move.

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,160
Weren't you boasting

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
that you've mastered it already?

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,200
I just ordered them

105
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
to add 30 percent more power,

106
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,760
and you can't handle it anymore.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
It's because the weapon
you gave me is too lousy.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,360
I can't use it well.

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Endure it a bit longer.

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
I've already ordered Yan Xiu

111
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,600
to find a better one.

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
That's more like it.

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,640
Chess Overseer.

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,400
Put some on the front part yourself.

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
I'll go out for a while.

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,480
(I wonder how His Majesty is doing now.)

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,480
(Maybe I should find some time)

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,400
(to visit Uncle)

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,760
(and ask him.)

120
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
Your Highness Prince Guang.

121
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Today,

122
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,280
which formation can't you solve again?

123
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Chess of Generals Formation.

124
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Chess of Generals Formation?

125
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
The entire Chess of Generals Camp

126
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
is like a big formation

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,600
that has me trapped.

128
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
I feel like

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,880
I can't breathe anymore.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Did you have a fight with Yanzhi?

131
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm not sure

132
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
what's up

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,440
with Qiu Yanzhi's attitude.

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,640
She's so strange.

135
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,520
On one hand,

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
she's giving me everything she can.

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
She also takes good care
of my basic needs.

138
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
On the other hand,

139
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,560
what I say and do

140
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,880
are all under her control.

141
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,240
I can't do anything.

142
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
What do you want to do?

143
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I want to go to the palace
and visit Uncle.

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,200
Uncle is old now.

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,640
With Aunt gone

146
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
and me dead,

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,680
he really has no family anymore.

148
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm very worried about him.

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
On the 3rd day next month,

150
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
go with me to the palace.

151
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
Your Highness, you can go out now?

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
The 3rd day next month

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
is Grand Empress Dowager's birthday.

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,880
Qiu Ziliang

155
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
can't lock me up then.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,040
Right.

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,440
This year passed by so quickly.

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
Yes.

159
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
Life is unpredictable.

160
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
It's like a dream.

161
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,520
No one was there?

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,560
We lied in ambush outside
Cai's Wine Shop.

163
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
To avoid alerting anyone,

164
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
we made a move after nightfall.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,440
No one entered or left
within that time.

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,680
But after we went inside,

167
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
no one was there.

168
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,720
Prince Guang's news can't be wrong.

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,360
I know.

170
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
That was why I sent people

171
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,680
to guard Violet Bureau's gate.

172
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
But Li Rong didn't go back either.

173
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,440
Could it be that they're both gone?

174
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,280
At the same time,

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
those warriors of sacrifice
in Yuzhen Hall are also missing.

176
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,720
We were too late.

177
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
It's been 96 days.

178
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
I tampered with that secret manual.

179
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
If an ordinary person takes the pill
according to it,

180
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
within one month,

181
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
he'll bleed from his eyes, nose, ears,
and mouth, and die.

182
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
But Qiu Ziliang

183
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,480
is still alive now.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
He's not dead yet.

185
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
I really can't figure it out.

186
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,640
We've waited all these years.

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
What's 100 days?

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
Ms. Yanzhi.

189
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
He works for you indeed.

190
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
We didn't find Cheng Xi.

191
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,040
She must be hiding in Heng'an.

192
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
But where would she go

193
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
along with so many people?

194
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Back then, Ruoling's life's
was hanging by a thread.

195
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,520
I just started studying how to treat
people back then.

196
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,560
Good thing Senior saved her.

197
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,360
Senior?

198
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,000
Back then, he cried saying

199
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
that the little girl
is his teacher's descendant.

200
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,680
That was why

201
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,280
I offered my 100-year-old snow ginseng.

202
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,440
I won't stay here anymore.

203
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
I'll go home and drink by myself.

204
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,040
It's 97 already.

205
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,640
What's 97?

206
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Qiu Ziliang has been
in isolation training

207
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
for 97 days already.

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,280
Your Highness.

209
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I have a question.

210
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,040
I know.

211
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
You know what I want to ask?

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
You want to ask me

213
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
if there's something fishy

214
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,640
with Qiu Ziliang's isolation training.

215
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,360
That's right.

216
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,040
My senior and I made that happen.

217
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
How long have you been planning this?

218
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,120
After the Morning Dew Rebellion,

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
I immediately went
to the Chancellor's Residence.

220
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,440
Take it.

221
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,200
Let's go.

222
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,200
Slowly.

223
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,520
And this one too.

224
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,920
Bring this too.

225
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,800
Hold it well.

226
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,400
Your Highness.

227
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,400
We're too late.

228
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,760
Let's go.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,760
To the mass grave.

230
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,000
There's more here.

231
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,080
I heard that Wang Yang was killed

232
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
because His Majesty wrote
a posthumous edict

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,640
to pass the throne to you.

234
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,200
To me?

235
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,920
Yes.

236
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,560
His Majesty commanded General Han Yue

237
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,800
to bring the posthumous edict
to Wang Yang.

238
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
He wanted him to help you
ascend to the throne.

239
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,240
But Qiu Ziliang got to him

240
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,120
and killed him.

241
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,280
Your Highness.

242
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,320
There are some things

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
that you must consider now.

244
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
At that moment,

245
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
I started thinking

246
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,880
about becoming emperor.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
During the Morning Dew Rebellion,

248
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,160
Official Wang was killed.

249
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
We couldn't find your corpse.

250
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,560
Your sister also barely survived.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
That day,

252
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,840
there was bloodbath in Heng'an city.

253
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
Countless people died unjustly.

254
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,280
I thought

255
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,960
that if I become emperor,

256
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
perhaps I could do something.

257
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,120
But you lived in seclusion.

258
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Because

259
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,880
the posthumous edict disappeared.

260
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,720
And Qiu Ziliang

261
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,520
didn't kill the late emperor as well,

262
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,280
but just kept him under house arrest.

263
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Because he knew

264
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
that if he killed Emperor Wenzong then,

265
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,640
you're the one next in line
for the throne,

266
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
not Qi Yan.

267
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,480
Right.

268
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,520
He was waiting.

269
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,839
I was waiting too.

270
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,720
When I lived in seclusion
in the mountains,

271
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
I met my senior.

272
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,440
His name is Tian Shan.

273
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,640
His ancestors were all physicians.

274
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,880
His wife was gentle,
and his daughter was cute.

275
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
They were originally living a happy life.

276
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,360
But one day ten years ago,

277
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
his wife brought their daughter Zheng

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,840
for a field trip,

279
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,240
and they encountered

280
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
envoys from the five halls
testing the eagles.

281
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,120
The eagles bit Zheng.

282
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,000
In order to protect their daughter,

283
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
his wife hurt the eagle.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,640
Qiu Ziliang was furious

285
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
and killed both of them.

286
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,640
To Qiu Ziliang,

287
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
he just killed two ants

288
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,720
while he was on a trip.

289
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,160
Tian Shan knew

290
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,960
that Qiu Ziliang is prestigious
and powerful.

291
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
But he didn't feel discouraged.

292
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,960
He went everywhere to investigate.

293
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
He finally found out

294
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,680
that when Qiu Ziliang was young,

295
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,920
someone who called himself Master Wuyuan

296
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,600
gave him half a copy of a secret manual.

297
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,880
He learned

298
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,440
his martial arts from there.

299
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
So you two worked together

300
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,320
and pretended to be Wuyuan's disciples,

301
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,360
then fabricated the latter half
of the secret manual

302
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
to make him take pills.

303
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,840
What will happen if he take them
according to the secret manual?

304
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
His organs will fail,

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,080
and he'll die.

306
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,920
Master instructed

307
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
that no one can enter and disturb him.

308
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
But Master has been
in isolation training

309
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,840
for three months already,

310
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,480
and he's still not done.

311
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,440
The situation is ever-changing.

312
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
Li Deyun is slowly gaining power.

313
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
That's not something
you and I should worry about.

314
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,920
All right.

315
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,920
Where is the real Master Wuyuan

316
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,840
and secret manual then?

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,440
When Tian Shan found Wuyuan,

318
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
he has already passed away
for many years.

319
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
We don't know where the secret manual is
all the more.

320
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,160
But this way,

321
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,240
it was more convenient for us
to make a move.

322
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,840
In the Chess of Generals Camp,

323
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,920
who's the Right Minister
taking charge on your behalf?

324
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,840
He's one of Tian Shan's disciples.

325
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
He was an actor.

326
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
He's good in impersonation.

327
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,040
His voice and built are similar to mine.

328
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,560
Back then,

329
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,960
he was the one who offered advice

330
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,960
to Qiu Ziliang.

331
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,720
Qiu Ziliang believed him

332
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
so easily?

333
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,000
Of course not.

334
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,680
You're the last disciple

335
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,280
of Master Wuyuan, Thirteen?

336
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,960
Yes.

337
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
Why are you wearing a mask?

338
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,760
Master gave this to me

339
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,320
as a reminder.

340
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,440
"Endure things without moving
just like the soil.

341
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,040
Think deeply and silently like you
can tolerate everything."

342
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,840
"Endure things without moving
just like the soil.

343
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,560
Think deeply and silently like you
can tolerate everything."

344
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,400
Interesting.

345
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,680
How can I believe

346
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,440
that the latter half of the secret
manual you gave me

347
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,840
is authentic?

348
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,000
Before Master died,

349
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,720
he gave the secret manual to me

350
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,880
and told me to give it
to the fated one.

351
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
I asked him,

352
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,760
"How can I know
that he's the fated one?"

353
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,080
Master answered,

354
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,280
"The one who believes

355
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
is the fated one."

356
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,080
I've already given it to you.

357
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
If you believe it,

358
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,680
use it.

359
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,920
If not,

360
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,560
place it in the shelves.

361
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,800
Qiu Ziliang

362
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
is naturally suspicious.

363
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,360
But he's also arrogant.

364
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,240
You can't make him believe

365
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,040
that you're just giving him
the secret manual.

366
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,160
We might as well

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
offer the advice of establishing
Chess of Generals Camp.

368
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,160
This isn't my objective

369
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
for coming today.

370
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,240
What is your objective then?

371
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
This is the Chess of Generals
Camp sketch.

372
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
I came up with it

373
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,400
after playing thousands of games

374
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
with Master all these years.

375
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,760
Do you like playing chess?

376
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,600
But I like to play human chess more.

377
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,280
Exactly.

378
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,920
Use people as pawns,

379
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,120
divide the work,

380
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,760
and be brave and not afraid to die.

381
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
Legitimacy belongs to the victor.

382
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,320
Yet you

383
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,320
will never fall in the position
of Chess Overseer.

384
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,480
This

385
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
is my Chess of Generals Camp.

386
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
It's also

387
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,720
my proof of allegiance.

388
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,280
Good.

389
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
Well said.

390
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,120
You like fighting and killing so much.

391
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,680
No wonder Master

392
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,200
wanted you to wear a mask
as a reminder.

393
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,680
Aren't you the same?

394
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
When Master gave you
the secret manual back then,

395
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,240
didn't he give you any reminders?

396
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,600
Of course he did.

397
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
When he saw

398
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,240
how successful Chess of Generals Camp is,

399
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
he naturally believed

400
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
that the secret manual is authentic.

401
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,040
The process is very long,

402
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,720
but in the end,

403
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,080
that day had finally come.

404
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,880
The day that the late emperor died,

405
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Qiu Ziliang started

406
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,680
to make pills and take them

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,160
according to the latter half
of the secret manual.

408
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,960
Everything is ready now.

409
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
We're only waiting for the final blow.

410
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
Those who are good in riding horses
fall from them.

411
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,000
Those who are good in swimming drown.

412
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Those who are good with drinking
get drunk.

413
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,280
Those who are good with wars get killed.

414
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,280
Now,

415
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,280
do you still want to become emperor?

416
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,680
Qi Yan is already beyond cure.

417
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,720
When Qiu Ziliang dies,

418
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,240
he'd be able to vent his anger,

419
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,320
and he'd naturally fall.

420
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,080
You want to take

421
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
what belongs to you

422
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,400
openly and uprightly?

423
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,440
I don't know.

424
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,000
Ling Ling.

425
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,240
Chess Overseer wants to see you.

426
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Stop.

427
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,600
You're not from Chess of Generals Camp.

428
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,440
Who are you?

429
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,480
You're Yuzhen Hall's
warrior of sacrifice?

430
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,240
Yes.

431
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
According to Madam's orders,

432
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I came to invite you to see her.

433
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,920
This way please.

434
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,440
Grandfather.

435
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,080
You arranged

436
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,440
all of these things

437
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,720
from heaven, right?

438
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,680
You can't bear for me to be alone,

439
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,920
so you allowed Ruoling to survive.

440
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
You can't bear for me to be helpless,

441
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,760
so you let Prince Guang
secretly help me.

442
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,200
Now,

443
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,640
even Qiu Ziliang is dying soon.

444
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,040
Yet I

445
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,800
still have a chance to live peacefully.

446
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,800
When Qiu Ziliang and Qi Yan

447
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
both die,

448
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,880
I'll give the thing to Prince Guang.

449
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,840
Then

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
I'll slowly grow old
together with Ruoling

451
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
and enjoy life
in this prosperous nation.

452
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,720
Chess Overseer.

453
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,800
What's the matter?

454
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,280
Someone sneaked in,

455
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,040
killed Pawn Three,

456
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,040
and took his clothes.

457
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
He took his clothes?

458
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Where's Ling Ling?

459
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,160
She was still practicing the formation
at the square earlier,

460
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,480
but she's gone now.

461
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,240
Chess Overseer.

462
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
We noticed something strange
in the woodshed's secret passage.

463
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,920
It seems like it had been opened.

464
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,680
I advised you to destroy

465
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
that secret passage last time.

466
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,200
Back then,

467
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,560
Grandfather escaped with me

468
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,160
and Ruoling from here.

469
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,240
It was a wrong decision.

470
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
I was negligent as well.

471
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,360
I originally thought that I can seal it

472
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,520
and just set up a mechanism there.

473
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
I didn't expect that someone else
would make use of it instead.

474
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,840
This is...

475
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,440
It's from Ling Ling's clothing.

476
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,880
Where are we going?

477
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,360
You'll know when we get there.

478
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,040
Later on, leave first.

479
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,400
They're here to capture me.

480
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Go and report back first.

481
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,840
Wait for me to find a chance
to meet you.

482
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,600
No.

483
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,920
Master said that she's in danger.

484
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,760
She can't stay long.

485
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
She must personally see you.

486
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,240
Why?

487
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,280
Master said

488
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
that it's about your real identity.

489
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
Her message can't be passed on.

490
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,040
She's waiting for you in Almond Forest.

491
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Get off the carriage first.

492
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,960
I'll lure them away.

493
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,840
Stop.

494
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,440
Well...

495
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,160
Aunt.

496
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,280
Let me out!

497
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,080
Let me out!

498
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Let me out!

499
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
Let me out.

500
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
I told you.

501
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,040
During this period of time,

502
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
stay in the camp.

503
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,760
I want to go and see Aunt.

504
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,960
You can't see anyone.

505
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
Don't you understand?

506
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
What I say in the Chess of Generals Camp

507
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,920
is like an imperial command.

508
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,360
Anyone who disobeys me,

509
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,560
dies.

510
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,480
Let me die then.

511
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,640
You know that I won't kill you.

512
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,720
You can't lock me up forever either.

513
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,680
Yanzhi.

514
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Let me out!

515
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,080
You can't lock me up forever!

516
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,280
Yanzhi!

517
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Yanzhi, let me out!

518
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,720
Just tell her the truth.

519
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm really scared

520
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,280
that before you can take revenge,

521
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
she'd treat you as her enemy first

522
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,920
and kill you.

523
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,320
She won't kill anyone.

524
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,560
But she'll hate you.

525
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,600
That's better than hating herself.

526
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,680
Forget it.

527
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,920
I won't try to convince you.

528
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,640
Anyway,

529
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,680
you never listen to me.

530
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,680
Xiu.

531
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,600
There's something

532
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,160
that perhaps I should tell you before...

533
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,120
Wait.

534
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Can I not listen to it?

535
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,160
Actually, I'm very busy.

536
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
I still need to find Cheng Xi.

537
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,640
That's right.

538
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,560
I think

539
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Cheng Xi

540
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,320
might be hiding
in Official Qiu's residence.

541
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,240
In Heng'an City,

542
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,520
that's the only place
we haven't searched.

543
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,560
I'm going there now.

544
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,920
Xiu.

545
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,600
(What is my identity)

546
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
(that Aunt is taking)

547
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,880
(such a big risk to tell me?)

548
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,200
(Yanzhi won't let me out of here.)

549
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,400
(What should I do?)

550
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,560
(I still remember)

551
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,880
when His Majesty and I
was locked together.

552
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
(His Majesty used the hair clasp
to harm himself,)

553
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,840
(forcing Han Yue to compromise.)

554
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
I wonder how His Majesty

555
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,720
is doing now.

556
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,120
Your Majesty.

557
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm back.

558
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,200
Han Ding.

559
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,600
Misha was killed,

560
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,840
and you weren't back.

561
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,360
I was so worried.

562
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I'm useless.

563
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,880
I was captured.

564
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,040
Fortunately, I didn't die.

565
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,240
I'm sorry to worry you.

566
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,360
It's good that you're back.

567
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,200
It's good that you're back.

568
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,280
Your Majesty.

569
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,320
Prince Guang's men were the ones
who captured me.

570
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,000
It's him indeed.

571
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
What should we do next?

572
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,120
Wear our armors and take our weapons.

573
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,600
Be brave and not afraid to die.

574
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,719
Let's do it one step at a time.

575
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,560
Qiu Yanzhi suddenly appeared

576
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,679
and blocked Ling Ling in Almond Forest.

577
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,560
And

578
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,360
the warriors of sacrifice we sent
to pick up Ling Ling

579
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,719
are all dead.

580
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,199
Their deaths are very worthy.

581
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,400
It seems like Ling Ling

582
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,719
is Yu'er.

583
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,679
Madam.

584
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,400
How can you be sure?

585
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,840
I saw her fight with Zhang Jiang.

586
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,440
Her technique looked very familiar.

587
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,920
Back then, I was already suspicious.

588
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,239
After returning to the capital,

589
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,719
I saw how Qiu Yanzhi

590
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,960
values her a lot

591
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,320
and how she's so cautious

592
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,200
that she'd get in contact with me.

593
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,880
That was why

594
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,440
I intentionally used

595
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
her identity as bait.

596
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,840
And Ling Ling...

597
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,600
No.

598
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,800
And Yu'er

599
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
fell for it indeed.

600
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,560
Yu'er is still alive.

601
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
That's great.

602
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,280
Yes.

603
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,760
It's great.

604
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,040
With her around,

605
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,440
I can overturn the situation.

606
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Madam.

607
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,920
You really want to tell Yu'er

608
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,680
her identity?

609
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,720
Of course.

610
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
If I don't tell her now,
when should I do it?

611
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,840
This pawn on Qi Yan's side

612
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,200
all these years

613
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,360
should finally be used.

614
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
I know that you see Yu'er

615
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,080
as family.

616
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,960
Then you should tell her

617
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
the truth all the more

618
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,680
for her to take revenge for her family.

619
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,400
Li Rong.

620
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
You'll help me

621
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,920
and Yu'er, right?

622
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,680
Madam.

623
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,560
Yan Xiu really brought people

624
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,840
to search for you
in Duke Chu's Residence.

625
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Indeed, I was hiding

626
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,280
in Qiu Ziliang's Residence before.

627
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,160
But now,

628
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
I already switched

629
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,480
to a safer place.

630
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,600
Cheng Xi isn't
in Official Qiu's residence.

631
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,360
A sly individual has more than one plan
to fall back on.

632
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm afraid she switched to another place.

633
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
She's really so cunning.

634
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,280
She intentionally wants to see Yu'er.

635
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,360
Since she failed once,

636
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,440
she'll try again.

637
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,040
You mean...

638
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,640
Instead of looking for her everywhere,

639
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,840
we should lure her to us instead.

640
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
We must take some risks

641
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
in order to totally eliminate her.

642
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
Cherry pastry

643
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,560
is my favorite.

644
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,600
Be good,

645
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,840
then I'll release you after some time.

646
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,160
For what?

647
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
To be your puppet?

648
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,360
I should just

649
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,480
stay here in prison instead.

650
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,960
Yanzhi.

651
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,440
I'll be straight with you.

652
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,640
I can't be like

653
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,240
the others in Chess of Generals Camp

654
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,720
and follow your orders.

655
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,840
They've been trained
since they were little.

656
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
They've lost their humanity already.

657
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,440
Aside from obeying and killing,

658
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,840
they have no souls.

659
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
But I'm different.

660
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,960
I grew up in Violet Bureau
since I was little.

661
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,040
Even if Aunt hid things from me,

662
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,120
she never locked me up

663
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,440
or tortured me.

664
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,600
And she didn't make me undergo

665
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,280
the cruel training in Yuzhen Hall.

666
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,560
That's why

667
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
I'm different from you guys.

668
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,920
It's already too late

669
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,800
to change me now.

670
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,280
I don't know why

671
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,040
you value me so much.

672
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,480
Perhaps

673
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,480
you think

674
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,120
that I'll be

675
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,200
a very good pawn.

676
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,600
Even if I get

677
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,320
to manage Violet Bureau again,

678
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,080
I won't listen to your orders either.

679
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,360
Because

680
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I'll only do what I think is right.

681
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,560
But what you think is right

682
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
might not necessarily be right.

683
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Then tell me.

684
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,000
How am I wrong?

685
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,760
I want to see Aunt

686
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,080
and Uncle.

687
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
What's wrong with that?

688
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,800
Yanzhi.

689
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,600
Let me go

690
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,880
before I harbor hatred for you.

691
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,400
We're friends,

692
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,160
aren't we?

693
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,800
Yanzhi.

694
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,080
Yanzhi.

695
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,840
Thank you.

696
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,760
Really?

697
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,320
Yu'er is out again?

698
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,960
Yes.

699
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,400
No one's following her?

700
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,200
No one.

701
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,440
She entered the palace.

702
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Uncle.

703
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,600
It's me.

704
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,920
Why are you here?

705
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,640
Don't I have your token?

706
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,640
No one was minding me anyway.

707
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,960
I got in very easily.

708
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,560
Uncle.

709
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,440
Are you

710
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
still unwilling to trust me?

711
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,560
I know many of your secrets.

712
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,400
For example...

713
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,640
The palace maid you're with

714
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
is Shenshen.

715
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
I believe you.

716
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,960
It's useless if you believe me.

717
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,480
His Majesty must believe me.

718
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,720
I think His Majesty
also believes you.

719
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
He believes me?

720
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,200
If he does, why did he send
cold noodles over?

721
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,400
Who is he giving the offering to?

722
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,400
The cold noodles must be brought daily.

723
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080
His Majesty said

724
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,360
that it's for a celebration.

725
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,000
A celebration?

726
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,800
(Does it hurt?)

727
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,640
(Do you regret it?)

728
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,560
(Are you happy?)

729
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,640
(Yes.)

730
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,400
Uncle.

731
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,200
I want to see His Majesty.

732
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,480
Can you arrange it for me?

733
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Even if Qiu Ziliang

734
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,600
is in isolation training,

735
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,320
in the palace,

736
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,200
he has lots of eyes and ears.

737
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,240
For example, Gao Ping,
who's serving beside His Majesty.

738
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,400
What kind of spy is that?

739
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
Based on His Majesty's
martial arts skill...

740
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,640
But His Majesty

741
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,920
even pants when he walks now.

742
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,640
Then I must see His Majesty
all the more.

743
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,280
Uncle.

744
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,520
Arrange it for me.

745
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,440
Yu'er.

746
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,680
come here at 11 pm tomorrow.

747
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,240
Wait in this place.

748
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Thank you, Uncle.

749
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,080
I'll get going then.

750
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,520
Yu'er.

751
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Actually, His Majesty
really treats you well.

752
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,080
I know.

753
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,520
That's why no matter what happens,

754
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,440
I'll never

755
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,720
desert him.

756
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,160
(She came indeed.)

757
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,120
Cai's Wine Store.

758
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,880
Madam Li.

759
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,720
Yu'er.

760
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,600
Madam Li.

761
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,360
It's you?

762
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,120
Where's Aunt?

763
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,200
Madam lost her martial arts skill.

764
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,080
It's inconvenient for her to come out.

765
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,240
She especially asked me
to come and see you here.

766
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,440
Good thing

767
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
you recognized me.

768
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,400
Of course.

769
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,600
I raised you.

770
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,280
Yes.

771
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,920
Aunt was busy when I was little.

772
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,680
You were the one

773
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,800
who always took care of me.

774
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,040
By the way,

775
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Aunt said that she wants to tell me

776
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,960
my real identity.

777
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,440
What exactly is going on?

778
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,320
Your real identity...

779
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,480
Did Madam tell you

780
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,040
that His Highness Prince Guang

781
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,320
saved you

782
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,160
from human traffickers?

783
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,560
Wasn't that what happened?

784
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,280
Actually,

785
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,560
His Highness

786
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,560
dug you out from a pile of corpses.

787
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,040
I...

788
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,320
Your identity is special.

789
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,360
You were born into a prestigious family.

790
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,120
And your grandfather
was a high official.

791
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,720
His surname is...
