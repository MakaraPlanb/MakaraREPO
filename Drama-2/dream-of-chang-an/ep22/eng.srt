14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
The Right Minister

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,280
is eccentric

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
and cunning.

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
His words are not to be trusted.

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
But, his words did make sense.

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Due to the fact that
he was an old friend of my grandfather,

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,160
that's why he was able to urge
Han Yue to act.

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
That's why he was able to urge
the descendants of the Zheng Family

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,800
to initiate the chain

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,480
of events.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,479
Because of that fact,

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,720
he complied to Qiu Ziliang in public
but opposed him in private.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,720
It's because he has an ulterior motive.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,720
If, he's really our ally,

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
what do you plan to do?

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,680
What do you plan to do with her?

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
Learning is a never-ending process.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,880
I plan to keep her by my side.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
I'll prove her wrong with facts.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,480
And I hope that she can change her ways.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,120
That's fine.

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
You may leave with her then.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,320
No.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,280
I need to stay here

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,320
in order to prevent the same thing

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
from happening again.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,400
No need for that.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
Without you,

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
I wouldn't be hurt in the first place.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
It was my negligence.

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm willing to receive punishment.

45
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
It's getting late.

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
I need to go to court now.

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
For today's morning court,

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
you don't need to follow me.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
I suggest you give up.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
I will never change my mind.

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,040
I suggest you to kill me right away.

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
If not, you'll face the consequences.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
General Han was only able

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
to survive the Morning Dew Rebellion

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
because His Majesty had saved him.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
What?

57
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,200
His Majesty was the one who saved him

58
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720
from the mass grave
when he was barely alive.

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,200
His Majesty assigned Han Ding to send
General Han to Baizhang Temple.

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
If you don't believe me,

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
you can confront Han Ding yourself.

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
That's impossible.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Back then, he was the one

64
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
who had massacred the Han Family.

65
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
Qiu Ziliang was extremely influential.

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,320
Back then, His Majesty

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
was only

68
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,520
a prince with no power or influence.

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
He could only follow his order.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
That means he's weak.

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,680
There's no need to come up
with excuses like these.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
When we encounter such disputes,

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,000
some people choose to die as a hero

74
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
while some people will endure hardships
and humiliations to achieve their goal.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,680
If, everything you said was true,

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
if His Majesty was someone
who resorted to any means

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
to get his hands on the throne,

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,040
why would the current Qiu Ziliang

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
detest and reject him?

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,120
Why would he force him to step down
from the throne then?

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,120
He...

82
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
He just thinks that he's capable enough
to escape from his grasp.

83
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Anyway,

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
I will never forgive Qi Yan.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
I know.

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
It's impossible for me to
eliminate your hatred for him

87
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
with just my words.

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,800
After all,

89
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,720
you're just picking on someone
who's weaker than you.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,640
What did you say?

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
His Majesty is weak and not influential.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
He's much easier to kill
compared with Qiu Ziliang.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
And, you were planning to die.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
You're just using His Majesty
as your scapegoat.

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
You think that your dead family members

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
will be appeased

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,680
once you killed His Majesty.

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Nonsense.

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,000
Enough.

100
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Since it has come to this,

101
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,040
I don't wish

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,960
to argue with you anymore.

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
When I was treating your wound,

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,480
I realised

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,480
that you were injured

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
before you attempted to
assassinate His Majesty.

107
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
What exactly is going on?

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,880
When the nest is overturned,
no egg stays unbroken.

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,840
That beast, Wang Lin,

110
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
he sent his men
to surround Almond Forest.

111
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,920
I...

112
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,280
Sir,

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,960
we've slain 32 soldiers of
the Zhenwu Army

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
inside Almond Forest.

115
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Besides that, we managed
to capture her as well.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
She's the servant of Han Yue.

117
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,120
Her name is Ziyuan.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
You guys may leave.

119
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,960
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
When that darned eunuch
wasn't paying attention,

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
I stole his keys and escaped from him.

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,720
Just wait and see.

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
For the humiliations that I've suffered,

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
I will pay them back to you guys

125
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
tenfold.

126
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,160
Wang Lin was the one
who had humiliated you.

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
But, you're actually

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
blaming His Majesty for this?

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,560
You're Qi Yan's lackey indeed.

130
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
I told you before.

131
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,800
I will prove you wrong.

132
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,560
Uncle,

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
regarding the favour I've asked of you,

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,520
please complete it as soon as possible.

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
Your Majesty,

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
were you referring to Yu'er?

137
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,520
Yes.

138
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
After Aunt Ninghe's death,

139
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm afraid the situation in Lucong
will change.

140
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,880
Please bring her away.

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
If all of us are leaving,

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
what about you?

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,520
This concerns my survival
in the first place.

144
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,520
I

145
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,240
will stay here
until the very last moment.

146
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Lady Li.

147
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Are you heading to your post?

148
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,680
Yes.

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
My father

150
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,680
went to find His Majesty today.

151
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,040
Do you know what they talked about?

152
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,000
Lady Li,
please get straight to the point.

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
So, His Majesty's women

154
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
are actually facing off
against each other.

155
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,480
Go and investigate

156
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
what exactly happened

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,040
between them.

158
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,440
All right.

159
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,240
They plan to send someone to Lucong

160
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
in order to meet up with the person
left by Ninghe

161
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,760
and exchange information

162
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,600
so that they can acquire intel regarding
Lucong's current military situation.

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,000
To find a suitable candidate,

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,840
firstly,

165
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,080
the person must be dependable.

166
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Secondly,

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
the person must be
skilled in martial arts

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,840
so that he or she may avoid
Qiu Ziliang's assassination attempt.

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Thirdly,

170
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
the person must be fearless of death.

171
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
You understand what I mean, right?

172
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm sure you know who the person is.

173
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
Lady Li, thank you for pointing it out.

174
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
My lady,

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
is she Cheng Ruoyu?

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,720
I heard that Grand Empress Dowager

177
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,960
gave her the Peach Blossom Jade Bangle
yesterday.

178
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,600
The peach trees are in full blossom.

179
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,760
Look at her.

180
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
Do you think she deserves such fortune?

181
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,240
Of course not.

182
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
Only our lady

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
is worthy enough to be
His Majesty's woman.

184
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,560
Is that person the goddaughter
of Duke Chu?

185
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,320
Yes, my lady.

186
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,200
His Majesty, Chen Yintai

187
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
couldn't wait for you to
assign his post to him any longer.

188
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,000
Now,

189
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,880
he's trying to win
the hearts of every faction.

190
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
The power that Shi Quanzhong

191
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
had left for Princess Ninghe

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
has lost its pillar of stability.

193
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,360
Some had already joined

194
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
Chen Yintai's faction.

195
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,120
Since we can use these people
to our advantage,

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
I'm sure Qiu Ziliang can do the same.

197
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm sure

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,720
they've come up with a plan.

199
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,400
That's why

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,800
they killed Princess Ninghe
to vent out their frustration.

201
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
The killer

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,760
is ruthless and cunning indeed.

203
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,040
Back then, when I sent Princess Lucong

204
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
to Lucong for her marriage,

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,040
I once saw Chen Yintai before.

206
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,160
Although he's ugly,

207
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,240
I heard that he's a decisive man.

208
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
He's good at training soldiers as well.

209
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
Even if the princess were still alive,

210
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
our men in Lucong

211
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,640
might still not be able to
control the situation.

212
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,960
So, this time,

213
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
we need to choose

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
the best candidate we have before
sending them to Lucong.

215
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Besides

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
contacting the Zhi Quanzhong's
loyal retainers,

217
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,680
the most important thing is for us

218
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
to understand the situation in Lucong

219
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,960
and control the situation

220
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,880
so that Chen Yintai doesn't
dare to act rashly.

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,920
Your Majesty.

222
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,480
Your Majesty,

223
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm willing to be your candidate.

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,560
Your Majesty, I hope I can
share your burden.

225
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,560
Please send me to Lucong.

226
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
I've selected another candidate
for this matter.

227
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Your Majesty, whom do you plan to send?

228
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
You don't need to know.

229
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Official Li,

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,920
have you selected a suitable candidate?

231
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
This...

232
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,640
If you don't have a suitable candidate,

233
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
what do you think about me?

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,080
Leave.

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,440
Official Li,

236
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
I hope you can persuade His Majesty

237
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,920
to send me there.

238
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
I will never allow it.

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
The candidate we will send to Lucong

240
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,640
will be decided by His Majesty.

241
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,600
Your Majesty,
I will resume with my work.

242
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,840
Get up.

243
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
I have another arrangement for you.

244
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,800
Uncle will be heading back
to his hermitage.

245
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm worried for his safety.

246
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,680
You can let Madam Jade accompany him.

247
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Uncle said he wanted you
to accompany him.

248
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
The situation in Lucong is undetermined.

249
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
It's very dangerous.

250
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,000
And, Qiu Ziliang

251
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,240
is waiting for a chance to attack us.

252
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm not afraid.

253
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,520
I know what to do.

254
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,480
Yu'er,

255
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
I know what to do as well.

256
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
Let me help you.

257
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,080
You're really loyal

258
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,520
to that darned emperor.

259
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
You want to head to Lucong personally?

260
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
You will follow me.

261
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
What did you say?

262
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,440
I told you to follow me to Lucong.

263
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Why are you here?

264
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I heard that Grand Empress Dowager

265
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,280
has rewarded you with
the Peach Blossom Jade Bangle.

266
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm here to take a look.

267
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
I've returned it
to Grand Empress Dowager.

268
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,400
You became smarter.

269
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,520
You're right.

270
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
It's better for you to return it sooner

271
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,200
when it doesn't suit you.

272
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,680
It doesn't suit me?

273
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Do you think it suits you then?

274
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,280
You mustn't forget this.

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,240
His Majesty has rejected you

276
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,800
time and time again.

277
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
What?

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,840
Are you jealous?

279
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,240
Wretched servant.

280
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
You're still keeping her alive?

281
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,480
Useless wretch
who had betrayed your master,

282
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll kill you with my own hands!

283
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,360
I think you should kill her.

284
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,120
She has deep hatred for us.

285
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,840
She's a recipe for disaster.

286
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm different from you.

287
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't kill people.

288
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,080
You don't kill people?

289
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Tell me.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Why are you here

291
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
today?

292
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,400
I heard that you're heading to Lucong.

293
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,720
There are plenty of spies
within the palace.

294
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,640
Do you think

295
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
you can keep this a secret

296
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,280
and head to Lucong
without facing any trouble?

297
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
That's why

298
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,680
I've come up

299
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,400
with a solution.

300
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Seems like

301
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
we're thinking of the same thing.

302
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,480
Stop the carriage.

303
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,560
Newcomer,

304
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,240
don't you even
recognise the Chess Bearer?

305
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,040
Chess Bearer, you're welcome
to exit the palace.

306
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
How do you plan
to investigate Chen Yintai

307
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,280
once

308
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,800
you've reached Lucong?

309
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,640
I'll act accordingly.

310
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,240
What if they have a tight security

311
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,640
and you have no chance to do so?

312
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,120
That won't be the case.

313
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Chen Yintai

314
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,920
always wanted His Majesty
to assign him the post.

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm sure he doesn't dare to neglect me

316
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
when I come from Heng'an City.

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Why don't you give me some tips?

318
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,880
Why should I do so?

319
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,520
You should do so

320
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,680
in order to help out
your future husband.

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
We're safe now.

322
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,800
You can get off the carriage

323
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,440
with your crazy lackey.

324
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,680
Don't do this.

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,080
Why don't you send me out of the city?

326
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,920
By the way,

327
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
you should prepare a great horse for me.

328
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,240
That way,

329
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,280
the people of the Chess of Generals Camp

330
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
won't chase after me.

331
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Why don't you

332
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,360
tell me

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,240
to send you to Lucong directly?

334
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
That won't do.

335
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
If you send me out,

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
Qiu Ziliang will chase after me.

337
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,960
I won't be able to go out by then.

338
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,720
Farewell.

339
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
You're helping her to get to Lucong.

340
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
If Eunuch Qiu finds out...

341
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,480
I'm the hostage right now.

342
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,360
I didn't expect...

343
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
You didn't expect what?

344
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,880
I didn't expect you

345
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
to buy the people's hearts

346
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
before you become the empress.

347
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
You mean I tried to bribe Cheng Ruoyu?

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
You covered up for her
and you even gave her a horse.

349
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,200
Isn't it obvious that
you're trying to buy her heart?

350
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,080
What?

351
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,680
Are you trying to establish

352
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,560
your influence within the harem
right now?

353
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,000
That's why

354
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,640
you must cover up for me.

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,280
Father,

356
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Cheng Ruoyu used me as a hostage

357
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
and left the palace
when I wasn't paying attention.

358
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,680
She even stole my horse.

359
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,600
If it weren't for the Left Advisor,

360
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
I would've been...

361
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
Ruoyu is bullying me because
I don't know any martial arts.

362
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,160
She has humiliated me.

363
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
Please lend me 100 soldiers
from your Shencai Army.

364
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I must pursue her.

365
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
You should rest up for now.

366
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,240
Regarding that matter,

367
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
I will send someone else

368
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,880
to do the job.

369
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,840
Yes, Father.

370
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
When I was barely conscious,

371
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,680
I think I heard Cheng Ruoyu saying

372
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
to Ziyuan

373
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
that she was heading to Zhaoyi.

374
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,480
Isn't she heading to Lucong?

375
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,480
What can she do by herself

376
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
even if she was heading to Lucong?

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
She's heading to Zhaoyi.

378
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
She's going to see
the nephew of Liu Congjian,

379
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,240
Liu Zhi.

380
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,600
She's right.

381
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
After our men had arrived at Zhaoyi,

382
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,520
we found out that Liu Congjian was dead

383
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
after our investigation.

384
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
And his nephew, Liu Zhi,

385
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,280
didn't announce the news in public.

386
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,680
He only sent His Majesty
a secret letter,

387
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,760
requesting for the post of
military commissioner.

388
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,680
I've ordered Gao Ping

389
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,520
to steal the secret letter.

390
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,040
So, how many local officials

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
are doing the same thing?

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Father, please don't be angry.

393
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,040
Since

394
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,760
Liu Zhi doesn't appreciate

395
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
our kindness, just like his uncle,

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,920
we should kill him.

397
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,160
Right Advisor.

398
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,560
Yes, my lord.

399
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,080
Did you hear that?

400
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
Settle this quickly.

401
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,200
By the way,

402
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,960
capture Cheng Ruoyu

403
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
for me as well.

404
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,480
Yes, my lord.

405
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,360
Left Advisor,

406
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,520
do you know your mistake?

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes, my lord.

408
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,240
You knew that the Chess Bearer
doesn't know any martial arts.

409
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
You should've stayed beside her
at all times.

410
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
Go out and receive your 10 lashes.

411
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,520
Yes, my lord.

412
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
Throughout our journey,

413
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
we saw ruined cities

414
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,960
and how the people are suffering.

415
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,440
The prefectures are in chaos,

416
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,120
and the foreign tribes are waiting
for their chance to invade our nation.

417
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
So,

418
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
who should be blamed for this?

419
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,520
Didn't all of this happen

420
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
because of that useless emperor?

421
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
For the past 40 years, the Xing empire

422
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
had 6 emperors.

423
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,960
Even the emperor's throne isn't stable.

424
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
How could the people live in peace?

425
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,600
Only a long rule

426
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,320
can establish a peaceful society.

427
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,160
His Majesty has such
a majestic ambition.

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
But,

429
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,640
why can't we

430
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,040
give him a chance
to atone for his mistake?

431
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,160
Ziyuan,

432
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880
you and I are clear

433
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,040
that the eunuch's faction is responsible
for the chaos.

434
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,840
Only by getting rid of them

435
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,520
will we be able to prevent a tragedy
like the Morning Dew Rebellion

436
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
from happening again.

437
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,880
General Han didn't understand that fact.

438
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
I hope you can reconsider your view

439
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
and understand the situation.

440
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,040
You must be the one the imperial court
had sent here

441
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
to assign me the post.

442
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,360
That's right.

443
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
I'm here under His Majesty's order.

444
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,440
You've murdered the
military commissioner, Shi Quanzong.

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,960
Now, the army of Lucong is in chaos.

446
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,480
The foreign tribes are waiting for
their chance to invade our nation.

447
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,960
The people are suffering.

448
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Today,

449
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm here to get an explanation from you.

450
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,840
You want an explanation?

451
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Ninghe is dead.

452
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,440
I've slain

453
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,400
Zhi Quanzhong's
trusted followers as well.

454
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Now, Lucong

455
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,360
is under my control completely.

456
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,840
Instead of waiting for the
imperial court to give me a position,

457
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,920
I would rather establish my own nation.

458
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
What do you think?

459
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,720
Yu'er!

460
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,200
Yu'er!

461
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,440
Your Majesty.

462
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,960
Han Ding,

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,640
where is Yu'er currently at?

464
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,840
We received news from her six hours ago.

465
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,440
She has reached the border of Lucong.

466
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
So,

467
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
have she met Chen Yintai?

468
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
Your Majesty, don't worry.

469
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
Our men are protecting her

470
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
in secret.

471
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,040
What's the news?

472
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,760
Cheng Ruoyu has arrived at Lucong.

473
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,240
What about Qiu Ziliang?

474
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,680
Liu Zhi has a large number of soldiers
on his hand.

475
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,600
The Shencai Army general
who Eunuch Qiu had sent

476
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,280
was slain by him immediately.

477
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,920
The soldiers who were
sent there in secret

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,640
were slain when they entered
the Liu Residence.

479
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,240
Great.

480
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm sure Qiu Ziliang will be enraged.

481
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,440
The more he's enraged with
Liu Zhi's action,

482
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,960
the less attention he'll be able to pay

483
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,080
to the other areas.

484
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,760
So,

485
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
this trick of yours

486
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,760
is effective indeed.

487
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,800
Over here.

488
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,280
Stop right there.

489
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,080
Who are you guys?

490
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm the Sword Bearer of
the Violet Bureau,

491
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
Upper Rank Five female official,
Cheng Ruoyu.

492
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,640
She's my attendant, Ziyuan.

493
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,560
We're here under His Majesty's order.

494
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,080
Please wait a moment.

495
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,440
Please remove your weapon.

496
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,880
What?

497
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,600
Look at the amount of people you have.

498
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,560
Don't tell me
you're afraid of two girls?

499
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,720
Since ancient times,

500
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,080
only the emperor's subordinates
need to remove their weapon

501
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,480
when they see the emperor.

502
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,640
Both of us are here under
His Majesty's order.

503
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,760
We haven't even blamed you guys

504
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,520
for not greeting us although
we're here under His Majesty's order.

505
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
Since you're here under
His Majesty's order,

506
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,680
Naturally, I,

507
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,560
Chen Yintai,

508
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,640
must greet you, my lady.

509
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,120
But,

510
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,360
When a general is outside
from the palace,

511
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,240
they may choose not to embrace
a military order.

512
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,360
When you enter my tent,

513
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,440
you need to follow my rules.

514
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
Both of you,

515
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,080
please suit the convenience of the host.

516
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Please.

517
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,600
- Come, let's drink.
- Please.

518
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,000
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

519
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
My ladies, please.

520
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,320
My lady,

521
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,480
regarding the day I receive my post,

522
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,040
have the imperial court
set a date for it?

523
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
Our general

524
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,720
might not be able to wait any longer.

525
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm unclear regarding the date

526
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
His Majesty will assign you the post.

527
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,160
But, both of us are here

528
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,920
to investigate

529
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,320
the death of Shi Quanzhong,
the late military commissioner.

530
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,800
What did you say?

531
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
My lady,

532
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
the man is dead.

533
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
We should just forget about it.

534
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,720
I don't know

535
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,520
what else you two want to investigate.

536
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,160
Shi Quanzhong

537
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,800
was assigned the post of
military commissioner

538
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,960
by the late emperor.

539
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
He died all of a sudden.

540
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,520
We at least need to give the soldiers

541
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,760
a proper explanation
regarding his death.

542
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
My ladies,

543
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm sure you two are exhausted.

544
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,160
Someone.

545
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,960
Yes, sir.

546
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,960
Bring them to their tent.

547
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,600
Yes, sir.

548
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,800
My ladies, please.

549
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,240
This is your tent.

550
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,160
My ladies, please rest early.

551
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,960
Why did you say

552
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,720
that we're here

553
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,680
to investigate Shi Quanzhong's death?

554
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,040
Aren't you afraid that...

555
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,680
Lucong is a huge place.

556
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
There are over 1,000 men

557
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
inside the military camp.

558
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,440
How are we going

559
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
to contact the person
whom Princess Ninghe

560
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,560
had left behind?

561
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,480
Don't tell me you want us to ask them
one by one?

562
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,320
If so, why don't we

563
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,120
just tell them

564
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,600
about our identities and stand first?

565
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,040
That way, the person we need to contact

566
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,440
will find us naturally.

567
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,520
Aren't you afraid

568
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,600
that Chen Yintai will kill us?

569
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,640
What? Are you afraid?

570
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Of course I'm not.

571
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,320
Don't worry.

572
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,960
Chen Yintai doesn't dare to kill me,

573
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,040
just like how I don't dare to kill him.

574
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,200
Rest early.

575
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Maybe we'll receive news by tonight.

576
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,960
My lady, please show mercy.

577
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,040
I'm not here to harm you.

578
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
You better tell me who you are.

579
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,520
If not, I'll summon the guards.

580
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,440
Don't shout.

581
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
It won't be beneficial to both of us

582
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
if Chen Yintai's men were to come.

583
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,120
Who wrote this letter?

584
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,800
Are you a subordinate of
Princess Qinghe?

585
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,440
The names listed in the letter

586
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,840
are loyal followers of General Shi.

587
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Most of them

588
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,120
aren't willing to support Chen Yintai.

589
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,440
The relay stations

590
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,240
10 li west from the camp

591
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,400
are waiting for your orders, my lady.

592
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,360
My ladies,

593
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
our general is requesting
for your presence.

594
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,520
Two of you, follow me.

595
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,280
Who are you?

596
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm Zuo Qianwei,

597
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,840
the secret bodyguard of Official Huang.

598
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
I've been assigned to stay here
and relay information.

599
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
My lady, I'm here to protect you
under his order.

600
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

601
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,760
What should we do next?

602
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Should we head to the relay stations?

603
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,360
Ziyuan,

604
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
bring him

605
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,560
to the relay stations

606
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,080
and meet up with Princess Ninghe's men.

607
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,640
Tell them not to act.

608
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
His Majesty has a way to deal with this.

609
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,720
What about you?

610
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,880
Someone assaulted the camp.

611
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
I must get to the bottom of this.

612
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,800
I'll meet up with you later.

613
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,680
Take care.

614
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,480
Is General Chen dead?

615
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,160
I saw his body for myself.

616
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,960
Official Zhang Jiang was the one
who killed him.

617
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,040
With one swing,

618
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,360
his head rolled to the floor.

619
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
General Chen's reign

620
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,000
was short-lived.

621
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,040
My men from Lucong
had reported back to me.

622
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
Three days ago,

623
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,800
Chen Yintai

624
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,680
had met up with His Majesty's envoy.

625
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
And I

626
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,080
knew nothing about it.

627
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,680
But Grandfather,

628
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Qi Yan didn't send anyone to meet him.

629
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,120
Who said so?

630
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,480
He sent Cheng Ruoyu!

631
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,920
It's my fault.

632
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,520
I fell

633
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,640
for her trick.

634
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,639
You.

635
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,920
You told me

636
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,239
that she went to Zhaoyi.

637
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,159
And you,

638
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,000
you said Liu Congjian
stationed his troops at Zhaoyi

639
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,960
and he was up to no good.

640
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,920
And you!

641
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,520
You said there was nothing
to report about

642
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,639
during your surveillance.

643
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,800
I only received news regarding

644
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,760
the incident in Lucong after three days!

645
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,320
Ever since Han Yue murdered
the Two Chariots,

646
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,679
Lucong

647
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,440
turned into a mess.

648
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,480
It's time for us to rectify our mistake.

649
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,159
It was my negligence.

650
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,880
I wasn't able to atone for my mistake
in time.

651
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,120
Right Minister,

652
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,520
keep an eye on them in secret.

653
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,239
Wang Lin!

654
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,080
Yes, my lord.

655
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,960
Send troops to guard the city's gate.

656
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,639
If you see Cheng Ruoyu,

657
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,760
kill her immediately.

658
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,639
Yes, Grandfather.

659
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,280
All of you, get up.

660
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,480
Father,

661
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,040
these are the court officials
who Li Deyun had visited

662
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,520
for the past period.

663
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,720
Have some water.

664
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,000
If you followed

665
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
Qiu Yanzhi's instruction

666
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,840
and killed Chen Yintai from the start,

667
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,800
we didn't need to go through
all this trouble.

668
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,200
How could I do so?

669
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,520
Chen Yintai

670
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,320
was murdered by Zhang Jiang,
General of the Standard.

671
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,160
That means the Lucong army
wasn't satisfied with his command.

672
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,560
After his death,

673
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,800
I guess the others he had colluded with

674
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,520
will stop acting for now.

675
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,080
We need to hurry back.

676
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
We need to report this to them.

677
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,440
I almost forgot.

678
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
You're in a hurry to return

679
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,280
in order to claim credits
from your darned emperor.

680
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,640
Do you really think

681
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,320
that the situation will be better

682
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,880
if Prince Guang ascended the throne?

683
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,160
At least Prince Guang is a good guy.

684
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,080
His Majesty isn't a villain.

685
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
The darned emperor acknowledged
a eunuch as his father.

686
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,680
He had to bow down to him
and lick his boots.

687
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
Prince Guang hasn't

688
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
licked Qiu Ziliang's boots at all.

689
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
But, he's living in seclusion.

690
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,000
He's escaping from the mess.

691
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,160
Not only did His Majesty not escape
from this mess,

692
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,320
he's bearing every sin

693
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,880
and humiliation by himself.

694
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,520
After his ascension,

695
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
he was determined

696
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,320
to get rid of the eunuch's faction.

697
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,400
That's why Qiu Ziliang

698
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,200
tried to assassinate him

699
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,880
time and time again.

700
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,880
If you were right about the situation,

701
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
why didn't he follow his every command?

702
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,520
Damn it.

703
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,720
We would've arrived

704
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,560
three days earlier

705
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,760
if we didn't need to avoid
the spy from the Generals of Chess Camp.

706
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,360
Today will be the end of
our two-month deadline.

707
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,200
Will we be able to make it?

708
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,280
The gate has a tight security.

709
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,760
Entering the city will be
an arduous task.

710
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,960
What should we do then?

711
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,960
The morning court has started.

712
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,040
Let's go.

713
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,680
Your Majesty,

714
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,560
the two-month deadline is up.

715
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,080
Official Li Deyun,

716
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
so, what should we do

717
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,720
about the incident in Lucong?

718
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
During the rebellion of Heshuo,

719
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,840
in order to settle the dispute,

720
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,440
we sent envoys
to deliver the imperial edict.

721
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
But, by doing so,

722
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,000
we'll be implicated instead.

723
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,640
The current situation in Lucong

724
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,880
is still undetermined.

725
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,320
Even if Chen Yintai
is requesting for a post,

726
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,560
we should

727
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
ignore him

728
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,440
and observe as the situation unfolds.

729
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,120
Observe as the situation unfolds?

730
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,520
Official Li Deyun,

731
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
you were given two months

732
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,320
to settle this dispute.

733
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
In the end, you're telling us
to ignore the matter

734
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,120
and observe as the situation unfolds?

735
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,920
Is that all from you?

736
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
Your Majesty,

737
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,880
Official Li swore he would receive
military punishment if he failed.

738
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,680
He said he would settle
the dispute in Lucong

739
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
within two months.

740
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,840
But now,

741
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,600
time is up.

742
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,200
Your Majesty,
please pursue responsibility.

743
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,840
Your Majesty,
please pursue responsibility.

744
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,240
Your Majesty,

745
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,840
Official Li's plan is a long-term plan.

746
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,320
Although the situation in Lucong
is still undetermined,

747
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
I assume Chen Yintai

748
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
has no countermeasures to it.

749
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,600
Lucong is quite far away.

750
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm sure we'll receive news

751
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,480
after a few more days.

752
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,240
No.

753
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,320
He was given two months.

754
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,280
Now, the deadline is up.

755
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,680
We need to pursue responsibility
immediately.

756
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,080
So what if we receive news

757
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,000
after a few days?

758
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,920
Isn't it disgraceful for him

759
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,760
not to keep his promise?

760
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,000
This is?

761
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,560
This is the secret path
to the Chess of Generals Camp.

762
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,400
Are you out of your mind?

763
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,480
Don't tell me
you want to let them arrest you?

764
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,600
We'll only be able to avoid

765
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,720
being spied on by Qiu Ziliang's men
if we use this path.

766
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,520
Let's hurry.

767
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,800
Fine, we can use this path.

768
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
But, have you thought of a way

769
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,160
to escape from
the Chess of Generals Camp?

770
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,000
Qiu Yanzhi.

771
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,240
We can ask Qiu Yanzhi to help us.

772
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,000
You do trust her.

773
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,680
We're out of time.

774
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,440
I don't have time to worry about this.

775
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:10,920
We need to make this bet.

776
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,520
Let's go.

777
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,800
(Yu'er,)

778
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
(even now, you haven't returned.)

779
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,920
(Did something happen to you?)

780
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,840
Come.

781
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,880
Let's go.

782
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,760
Who are you?

783
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,560
I'll stall them. Just go.

784
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,320
Your Majesty,

785
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,080
a promise is a promise.

786
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,360
Your Majesty, please issue
an imperial edict

787
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,600
and strip Li Deyun of his post.

788
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,000
Your Majesty, please issue
an imperial edict!

789
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,000
All of you may rise.

790
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

791
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,680
The chaos within the prefectures

792
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,040
is still ongoing.

793
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,360
Although it's the fault of my subject,

794
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,400
it's my responsibility as well.

795
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
I'm willing to issue an imperial edict
to take the blame

796
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,920
on behalf of Official Li.

797
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,160
No.

798
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,040
Your Majesty, if you do this,

799
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,960
in the future, you'll be able

800
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,280
to take the blame
for your incompetent subjects.

801
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,360
The law would be useless by then.

802
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,960
The law?

803
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm the one who makes the law.

804
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,360
I am

805
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,680
the law.
