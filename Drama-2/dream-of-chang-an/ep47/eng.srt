Today is different from before.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
In the Morning Dew Rebellion before,

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,520
you were able to escape.

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
I didn't expect

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
that you'd control the nation's affairs

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,360
and harm the citizens for so many years.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Today,

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
it's time for you to die!

(Danfeng Gate)

Chess Overseer, listen to the command!

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,680
Kill everyone in Hanyuan Hall!

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,640
Kill them!

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Kill them!

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
The Chess Overseer of Chess
of Generals Camp is here.

28
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,650
(General)

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,560
- Greetings, Chess Overseer!
- Greetings, Chess Overseer!

30
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Yanzhi!

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
My good daughter.

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,160
Isn't this heart-wrenching?

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
When playing chess,

34
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,440
we hate it when surprises happen.

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,160
Because any surprise

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,920
is caused by an incompetent setup.

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,680
That was what I said.

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,840
Nice.

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Could it be

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,440
that you won't listen to me anymore?

41
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
Why do I need you...

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,280
No.

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
No.

44
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,400
You're not from Chess of Generals Camp.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,920
Who exactly are you?

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,040
(Pawn)

47
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
They're my people.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
I see.

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
While I was choosing

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,560
new chess pieces,

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
you

52
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,160
arranged your people here.

53
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
It's you!

54
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
(Chess of Generals Camp)

55
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
(Chess of Generals Camp)
Mine was taken away.

56
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,760
I stole Left Chariot's.

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
With this token,

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
we can exchange

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,280
the Golden Chess Pieces with people
from our side.

60
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
You can only blame Left Chariot
for being too stupid.

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,080
He couldn't even see through that trick.

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,120
What did you say?

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,760
Go!

64
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,000
(No wonder they evaded me)

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
(and immediately left)

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,240
(when I fought with them)

67
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
(at the forest that day.)

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
(Yanzhi and His Majesty)

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
(are really in sync.)

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
What a good setup.

71
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
This is

72
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,760
the best setup I've ever seen!

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Yanzhi.

74
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,240
Good.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
You're very good.

76
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,040
I didn't expect

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,080
to fall into your hands.

78
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,560
No.

79
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,280
You're utterly evil.

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,760
Your allies and friends
have forsaken you.

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
You fell into the people's hands.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Well said.

83
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Well said!

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Qi Yan!

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
Don't forget.

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,040
I gave you the throne.

87
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,360
And you,

88
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,280
you useless bunch of people!

89
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,760
I gave you

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,960
your positions!

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Prince Guang!

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,840
I spared your life!

93
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,360
And you,

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,720
you beasts!

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,680
I taught you martial arts!

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,240
Forget it.

97
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,400
Forget it.

98
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,920
Forget it!

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
Yanzhi.

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,880
You were the one

101
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
I spent eight years of effort

102
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,320
in raising.

103
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,720
Xing is led by the Qi family.

104
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
His Majesty is their descendant.

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,840
You're just a eunuch.

106
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
How can you dare say
that you gave him his throne?

107
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,800
His Highness Prince Guang
is the emperor's uncle.

108
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Is it up to you to spare his life?

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,560
I think

110
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
he just spared your lowly life!

111
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,520
And hundreds of imperial officials

112
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
studied hard

113
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,560
for the imperial examination

114
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
or accomplished great things

115
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
in order to receive
the emperor's support.

116
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,159
What does it have to do with you?

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,559
And you forced
the Chess of Generals soldiers

118
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,559
through your power and authority

119
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,840
to leave their hometowns

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,679
and sell themselves as slaves.

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,880
They're living cruel, dangerous

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
and hellish lives.

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,680
In their hearts,

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,920
they've been spurning you
for a long time.

125
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
And you forced Yanzhi

126
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,040
to kill people

127
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
and do evil things.

128
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
How can you mention

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000
your efforts?

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
Yanzhi is right.

131
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Qiu Ziliang.

132
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
You're utterly evil.

133
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Your allies and friends
have forsaken you.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Today,

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,520
Go!

379
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,220
(Chess Ancestor Shennong)

380
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,680
It's in this painting?

381
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,000
All these years,

382
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,120
everyone's been looking for it,

383
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,240
especially Qiu Ziliang.

384
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,280
But the posthumous edict

385
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,600
was right under his nose.

386
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Ruoqing, what are you planning to do?

387
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Xiu.

388
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,040
Yes.

389
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,400
Guard the door.

390
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,360
Yes.

391
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,960
Ruoqing.

392
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,320
It depends on what
you're planning to do.

393
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Me?

394
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,080
Back then,

395
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
even if Qi Yan was being threatened
by Qiu Ziliang,

396
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,600
he was still an accomplice.

397
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,440
His Majesty had his reasons.

398
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,280
But he told me

399
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
not to tell anyone about it.

400
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
When I get his permission,

401
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,840
I'll surely tell you.

402
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
It's not important
whether I believe it or not anymore.

403
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,360
Now,

404
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,480
the decision is in your hands.

405
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
I kept it

406
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
for your sake.

407
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,120
In the future,

408
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
If Qi Yan fails you,

409
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,040
give it to Prince Guang

410
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,360
or someone else.

411
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Anyway,

412
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,400
you must take precautions
against people.

413
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,560
Remember.

414
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,000
This is the last protection talisman

415
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,760
I can leave to you.

416
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Ruoqing.

417
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,840
Ruoling.

418
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,680
Your Majesty.

419
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,480
The guards outside

420
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,720
are all new.

421
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,560
You've noticed?

422
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes.

423
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,840
I don't know what's going on.

424
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,560
Your Majesty.

425
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,040
I'll go to Official Han at once.

426
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,480
I knew it.

427
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,080
Teacher.

428
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,480
This day has finally come.

429
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
Ruoling.

430
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,480
Ruoqing.

431
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,520
I might

432
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,040
have to leave you.

433
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
Don't leave me.

434
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,840
Don't leave me.

435
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm just worried about you.

436
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,360
You're my only family

437
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,680
in this world.

438
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm begging you.

439
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,120
For my sake,

440
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
live.

441
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,000
It hurts so much.

442
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,840
Ruoqing.

443
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
I'm going to find Grandfather.

444
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,040
Together with Grandfather,

445
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,000
I'll look down on you from above.

446
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,600
No.

447
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,800
I don't want that.

448
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm sorry, Ruoling.

449
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,400
I still have to leave you by yourself.

450
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,360
Don't leave me.

451
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Don't.

452
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,920
Xiu.

453
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
Xiu.

454
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,880
- Xiu.
- Xiu!

455
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,880
From now on,

456
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,760
Ruoling is your sister.

457
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,480
Yes.

458
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,640
Do you still remember

459
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
what you promised me?

460
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,000
I do.

461
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,240
I can feel at ease then.

462
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
Come here.

463
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
In this lifetime,

464
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,480
I owe you too much.

465
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,520
In the next life...

466
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,080
In the next life, I'll surely repay you.

467
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,320
Ruoqing.

468
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,080
Ruoqing.

469
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,240
Ruoqing!

470
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,840
Ruoqing!

471
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
Ruoqing.

472
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,800
You won't feel pain anymore.

473
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,880
You won't suffer anymore.

474
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Ruoqing.

475
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,720
Ruoqing.

476
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,440
Qi Ang.

477
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,680
Qiu Ziliang is dead.

478
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
The power of the eunuch's faction
is slowly declining.

479
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,000
I finally did

480
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,240
what I promised you.

481
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,240
I've won.

482
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,440
Many people died.

483
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,280
And my hands are also stained
with blood.

484
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,320
But I don't regret it.

485
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,560
In a crisis,

486
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,200
one can see people

487
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,800
and things clearly.

488
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,520
That's why I'm very lucky.

489
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,680
I'm also very unlucky.

490
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,680
That person

491
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,720
can't restrain himself anymore.

492
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
What should I do?

493
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,360
What should I do now?

494
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,640
Qi Ang.

495
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm really tired.

496
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,200
I don't want to see

497
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,120
more people die.

498
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,720
I was able to win against
the eunuch's faction

499
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
and Qiu Ziliang.

500
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,600
But this time, I'm up against

501
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,720
my own uncle.

502
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,120
They're asking

503
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,800
what your decision is.

504
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,400
Your Highness.

505
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,120
Everything is ready.

506
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,680
Your Highness.

507
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,720
(Wait.)

508
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,040
(We have to let her go in peace.)

509
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,670
(Chess of Generals Camp)

510
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,840
Ruoqing.

511
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,680
We're home.

512
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,880
I still remember.

513
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,520
When we were little,

514
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,320
we often

515
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,240
played hide and seek in this yard.

516
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,760
I

517
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,320
was very naughty.

518
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,400
I always climbed up in the trees.

519
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,520
One time, I fell,

520
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,600
and I fell very hard.

521
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,680
You kept comforting me

522
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,120
and even made a lot
of cherry pastries for me.

523
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,160
I also remember

524
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,200
that when we were little,

525
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,320
we'd read poems with Grandfather.

526
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,000
Leave home and go to war
with the general,

527
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,560
wearing a sword with gold accent
to build meritorious deeds.

528
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,680
Regardless if it's cold
and the horse is freezing,

529
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,600
I only see the wars in the borders
and try my best to kill the enemies.

530
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:45,080
I only see the wars in the borders
and try my best to kill the enemies.
