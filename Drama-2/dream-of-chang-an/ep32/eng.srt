=Episode 32=

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,480
Since ancient times, autumn has been
considered sad and lonely.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,720
I think autumn is better
than spring though.

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,760
A crane flies towards the serene sky

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,240
and carries my poetic sentiments
to the clouds.

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,040
You think you've won?

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,400
It's exactly the opposite.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
You've lost.

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,480
At this moment,

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Prince An is probably dead already.

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,800
Chess Overseer.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,440
Go and tell Madam Cheng

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that we had a happy collaboration.

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
Yes.

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
I told you.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
You couldn't protect him,

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
Right Minister.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,240
Do you want to know what I've done?

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
This is fabric soaked in licorice.

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
It's what's left
from the new emperor attire.

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
You figured it out?

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,240
Yes.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
Licorice isn't enough.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,840
We need lilac daphne.

37
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,880
You surely want to ask me

38
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
why I want to kill Prince An.

39
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,399
Qi Yan will die soon.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,399
Even gods can't save him.

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,279
And Prince An has the support
of the clan.

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,440
If he ascends to the throne someday,

43
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
he'd only be harder
to deal with than Qi Yan.

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,560
Most importantly,

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
I found an ally.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
Don't you want to know

47
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,280
who helped me place the lilac daphne?

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,880
Thirteen.

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,960
Haven't you realized it yet?

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
At this point,

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
you can't save anyone.

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,080
If you want to save the nation,

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
save Xing,

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
there's only one way.

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,880
Ascend

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,640
to the throne.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Sir.

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,480
The...

59
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,400
The auspicious time has arrived.

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm tired.

61
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Go.

62
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Bring Qi Yan here.

63
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,840
Let him participate in the ceremony.

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
Say

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
that His Majesty is lucky,

66
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,240
and his condition improved.

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,360
Abdication

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,840
won't be done for now.

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,520
Yes.

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,000
Let the divine healer

71
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,640
go to Qi Yan.

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,520
Tell him to come up with something

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
to extend Qi Yan's life.

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Yes.

75
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,560
Here.

76
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,920
Is it delicious?

77
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,120
It's so sweet.

78
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,720
It's too sweet?

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
I think it's quite good.

80
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Drink more.

81
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Here.

82
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,040
All right.

83
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
It's really sweet.

84
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,960
One more sip.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All right, that's enough.

86
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
One more.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
All right.

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,600
Someone's coming.

89
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
Hurry.

90
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
Hurry up.

91
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Hurry up, Your Majesty.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,760
Lie down.

93
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,840
You're sick.

94
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,680
Hurry.

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Don't be so rough.

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,040
All right.

97
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
Wipe your mouth.

98
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,400
My mouth.

99
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,080
Thirteen.

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,840
Thirteen!

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,640
Thirteen.

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
Are you really going
to be this stubborn?

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,880
His Majesty has arrived!

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
Your... Your Majesty.

105
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,640
I

106
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,600
am back.

107
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,920
Long live Your Majesty!

108
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,600
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

109
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,480
Prince An passed away this morning.

110
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
That's why Qiu Ziliang had no choice

111
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
but to send people to bring you out.

112
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,440
Your Majesty.

113
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
How

114
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,000
did Qi Rong die?

115
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
They said it was poison.

116
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,960
Qiu Ziliang is already

117
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
investigating this matter clearly.

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

119
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,120
Your Majesty.

120
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,600
How are you feeling?

121
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
Go and rest.

122
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Official Li.

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
It will be hard

124
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,680
for me to recover anymore.

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,080
Even if I'm alive,

126
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm just dragging out
a feeble existence.

127
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,760
That's why

128
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
you must make plans.

129
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,120
Your Majesty.

130
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,520
Weren't you unwilling to see me

131
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
to avoid suspicion?

132
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,120
It's too late

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,680
to come now.

134
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
Since you came to me,

135
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,160
you must have found out about everything

136
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
from Cheng Xi.

137
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,880
And then what happens?

138
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
How do you plan to punish me?

139
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Report me to Qiu Ziliang,

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
or

141
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
collaborate with me

142
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,680
to continue this game?

143
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Your Majesty.

144
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,400
Why

145
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,520
did you say that to Official Li?

146
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,520
When I lost power,

147
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,440
Li Deyun took control
of the Zhaoyi Army.

148
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,360
And he was temporarily managing
the Shencai Army.

149
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,120
Yet he was trapped

150
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,480
by the soldiers so easily,

151
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
and he did nothing.

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,440
Your Majesty.

153
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,160
You're suspecting Official Li?

154
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm not taking precautions against him,

155
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,040
but against the third party

156
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,920
who's still in the dark now.

157
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,800
That's why

158
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
we must continue showing weakness,

159
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
and wait for him to make a move?

160
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,440
No.

161
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,200
This time,

162
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
we're not waiting.

163
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I want to set up traps

164
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,480
and lure him in.

165
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,120
Sir.

166
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,120
Licorice and lilac dahlia.

167
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,160
Two kinds of poison.

168
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Using only one won't do anything.

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
But if both are used at the same time,

170
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
one will die immediately.

171
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
Did you find out already?

172
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,280
Who switched the bamboo tube?

173
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
It was that old eunuch

174
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,320
who was serving Prince An.

175
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,320
He took poison and committed suicide.

176
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
We searched his room,

177
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,160
but didn't find anything.

178
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,280
What about the emperor attire?

179
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
According to the Imperial
Clothing Bureau,

180
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,200
someone with the same built as Cheng Xi

181
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,640
entered the place
where the emperor attire was placed.

182
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,720
Cheng Xi.

183
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
It's you again.

184
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,720
It's you.

185
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,280
I can't believe that it's you.

186
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
It's really you.

187
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
No wonder you said you were
Grandfather's old friend.

188
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,320
No wonder you were helping me secretly.

189
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,680
No wonder you weren't willing
to kill Qi Yan

190
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
and Prince An.

191
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,440
And no wonder Cheng Xi

192
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
was so sure that you can
ascend to the throne.

193
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Everything

194
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,400
that I couldn't figure out

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,760
is because of this answer.

196
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,480
So

197
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
the one who's really late

198
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,640
is you.

199
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,160
Did you get into the Chess
of Generals Camp

200
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,640
to find the late emperor's
posthumous edict

201
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,400
and became Right Minister?

202
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes,

203
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,360
and no.

204
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,320
Qiu Ziliang's Shencai Army

205
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
was too powerful.

206
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
In order to weaken it,

207
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,440
there must be coordination
from the inside.

208
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,800
I built Chess of Generals Camp
to deal with internal issues

209
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,840
and supported Violet Bureau to fight
against external enemies.

210
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
This game

211
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,560
already started

212
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,000
since the Morning Dew Rebellion.

213
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,040
Without me,

214
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,040
you might have already won,

215
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,720
right?

216
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
You're alive,

217
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,319
yet you never came to find me.

218
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,640
Find you?

219
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,319
For what?

220
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,079
As Prince Guang, you hid
your capabilities so well

221
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,119
and kept a very low profile.

222
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Everyone says that you

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,240
were born mentally challenged.

224
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,600
After you grew up,

225
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,480
you lived in seclusion and ignored
the nation's affairs.

226
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,920
Should I find you
to help me seek revenge?

227
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,600
And

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,760
as Right Minister,

229
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,680
you've long known that I'm Wang Ruoqing.

230
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
If you really feel bad

231
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,480
for the Wang clan,

232
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,440
why didn't you tell me from the start?

233
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
I need to set things up again

234
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
to let you escape safely.

235
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,000
Because you don't trust me?

236
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,800
You don't trust me,

237
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,000
just like I don't trust you.

238
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,000
I've already lost my family

239
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
and acknowledged a traitor
as my godfather.

240
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,560
Every step is critical in this game.

241
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm not counting on anyone.

242
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't trust anyone.

243
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,000
What you did before

244
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
to Left Knight, Right Chariot,

245
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,320
Han Yue and Wang Lin

246
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,320
is understandable

247
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,520
because they deserved to die.

248
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
But Prince An was just a child,

249
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
and he was a descendant of the Qi clan.

250
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,680
After killing him,

251
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,440
even if you get your revenge,

252
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,520
how will you face your ancestors?

253
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
I don't care about that.

254
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
Back then,

255
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,000
you used my grandfather

256
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,720
and got the Wang clan

257
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
to be

258
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
on your side.

259
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Then we both encountered disaster

260
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
during the Morning Dew Rebellion.

261
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,560
In order to protect the posthumous edict

262
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,560
stating you as the successor,

263
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
Grandfather died.

264
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,320
So many people died because of you.

265
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,560
Yet I

266
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,000
survived.

267
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
Grandfather,

268
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,040
Ruoling.

269
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Grandfather!

270
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
After that, I made an oath.

271
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,520
I swore to take revenge.

272
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,160
An eye for an eye,

273
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,680
a tooth for a tooth.

274
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,760
How is he?

275
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,960
How long would it take
before His Majesty's injury

276
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,320
can be healed?

277
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,120
I'm afraid that it can't
be healed anymore.

278
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Sir.

279
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,080
How long can he last?

280
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,520
We'll have to see day by day.

281
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,120
All right.

282
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,840
You may go.

283
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes.

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,360
It seems like you must make a decision

285
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,000
on the next successor, Godfather.

286
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Your Majesty.

287
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,600
Why did the divine healer also say

288
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,840
that you won't last long?

289
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,040
What do you think?

290
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,920
The divine healer is also working
for the third party.

291
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
He's helping you keep it a secret
from Qiu Ziliang.

292
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,800
Then the third party...

293
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,560
The third party

294
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,720
is really powerful.

295
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,520
Yes.

296
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
There's only one thing

297
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I can't figure out now.

298
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
Why is he making

299
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,120
such a big effort

300
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,120
to do these things?

301
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,080
If I don't figure that out,

302
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,120
regardless if I win or lose,

303
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,400
I won't be able to accept it.

304
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,240
(Chess of Generals Camp)
You should congratulate me indeed.

305
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,520
I confirmed that Prince Guang
is Right Minister,

306
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,720
the real third party.

307
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,880
This game

308
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,320
is back in my control again.

309
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,760
Then you and Prince Guang earlier...

310
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,080
I was just acting.

311
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
The reason why I agreed

312
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,040
to collaborate with Cheng Xi
to kill Prince An

313
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
is to force Right Minister
to show himself.

314
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm a bit confused.

315
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
When did you

316
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,280
start suspecting

317
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,520
that Right Minister is Prince Guang?

318
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,320
Yuan Xing.

319
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,720
Yuan Xing?

320
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,360
Since Yuan Xing said

321
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,560
that the person who instigated it

322
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
was his nephew.

323
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
There are only two possibilities

324
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,520
for Yuan Xing to say that.

325
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,400
First,

326
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,000
Right Minister bought him off.

327
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,960
Second,

328
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,600
he's poisoned with rosa rubus.

329
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
You suspected Prince Guang

330
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,320
because of rosa rubus?

331
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,240
Yes.

332
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
If there can be one pot of rosa rubus,

333
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,280
there can be a second one.

334
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,440
I also wondered

335
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,360
if Prince Guang was working
for Right Minister.

336
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
After all, we've all personally

337
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,720
seen Right Minister's face
behind the mask.

338
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
That was a substitute.

339
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,720
I checked

340
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Prince Guang's identity again.

341
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,720
I found two interesting things.

342
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,800
First.

343
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,720
Do you know Prince Guang's order

344
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
among the royal sons?

345
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Thirteen.

346
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,720
Thirteen.

347
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,360
Right Minister's monastic name
is also Thirteen.

348
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,160
What is

349
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,720
the other interesting thing?

350
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Cheng Xi claims to be
Qi Hu's descendant,

351
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,920
Thirteen's sister.

352
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
But among the 18 daughters
of Emperor Xianzong,

353
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,400
she wasn't one of them.

354
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,600
So

355
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,480
Cheng Xi isn't
Emperor Xianzong's daughter?

356
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Before Prince Guang's birth mother
Madam Zheng

357
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
served Emperor Xianzong,

358
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
she was the concubine of Qi Qing,

359
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,080
Zhenhai's military commissioner.

360
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Qi Qing rebelled

361
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,200
and was killed by Emperor Xianzong.

362
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,640
Then Madam Zheng entered the palace

363
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
and gave birth to Prince Guang.

364
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,680
Cheng Xi is the sister

365
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,080
of Prince Guang from another father?

366
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,600
That's right.

367
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
It makes sense now.

368
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,720
When I found out about those things

369
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
and connected everything together,

370
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,880
I got the answer.

371
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,240
I just couldn't believe

372
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,240
that Prince Guang
is the real Right Minister

373
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,000
until the other night

374
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
when Cheng Xi came to see me.

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,840
It's been a while,

376
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,040
Miss Yanzhi.

377
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,760
Madam Cheng.

378
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,560
You're so calm.

379
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,240
You're not scared

380
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,920
to see me at all.

381
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,520
Because I know

382
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,720
that you'll come to me sooner or later.

383
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
Let me ask you.

384
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
Did Shi Yuan

385
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,080
really injure Qi Yan?

386
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,000
How long can he live?

387
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,000
Even if Cheng Xi wants Qi Yan to die,

388
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
she doesn't want Prince An to ascend
to the throne all the more.

389
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,920
After weighing the two,

390
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,360
she decided to kill Prince An.

391
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,680
She thought

392
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,040
that you wanted to kill Prince An too.

393
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Yes.

394
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,440
In the end,

395
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,480
I arranged the lilac dahlia,

396
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,360
and she arranged the licorice.

397
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Together,

398
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,040
we killed Prince An.

399
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
We're burying him just like this?

400
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,040
The divine healer said that we must
bury him quickly.

401
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,680
This poison

402
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,640
is contagious.

403
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,680
Come on.

404
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,480
So

405
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,000
- Prince An is actually...
- He's dead.

406
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,360
He doesn't exist in this world anymore.

407
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,480
What are you planning to do
with your sister?

408
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,840
I don't know.

409
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,440
We were originally planning

410
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,160
to let Prince An ascend
to the throne first,

411
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,400
so that Qiu Ziliang's guard
will be down.

412
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,240
And the medicine I gave Cheng Ruoyu

413
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
can also temporarily

414
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
let Qi Yan live.

415
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,200
That way,

416
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,080
we can finally use the pawn

417
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
we've planted for eight years.

418
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
However, now that Prince An's dead,

419
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,240
I'm afraid that Qiu Ziliang won't fall
for the trick anymore.

420
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,880
It would be good

421
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
if you and Wang Ruoqing
recognized each other earlier.

422
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
Yes.

423
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,000
It's too late.

424
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,800
Back then, Yanzhi was training
in the camp.

425
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
I even saw her from afar,

426
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
yet I didn't recognize her.

427
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
Regardless,

428
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,920
as long as you and her
recognize each other,

429
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,840
she'll surely be willing

430
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
to work with you.

431
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,040
Is that so?

432
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,520
Her hatred for her family's death

433
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,880
won't be gone because of me.

434
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,360
Trust

435
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,400
also won't be built instantly,

436
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
especially with someone
who got hurt before.

437
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Just like an animal
that was once wounded,

438
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,120
she will be extra careful

439
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,560
and cautious.

440
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
But I deserve

441
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,520
all of that.

442
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,560
On the day of the Morning Dew Rebellion,

443
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,480
I saved so many people,

444
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,040
yet I never found her.

445
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,360
But you saved her sister.

446
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,800
When are you planning to tell her

447
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
that her sister is alive?

448
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,040
I don't know.

449
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,040
Once we reveal it,

450
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,000
and Yu'er finds out

451
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
that His Majesty,
whom she keeps trying to protect,

452
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,360
is her enemy...

453
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,520
What's the matter?

454
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,000
Did you have a nightmare?

455
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,960
Sister.

456
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,720
What?

457
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,200
I have a sister.

458
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,200
A sister whom I was very close with.

459
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,080
You remember things
from when you were little?

460
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,360
Just now,

461
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,760
I dreamed of sitting in a pavilion

462
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,320
and eating cherry pastry with my sister.

463
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,880
Your Majesty.

464
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,560
When I was little,

465
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,520
I tasted cherry pastry
from General Han Yue's house.

466
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,960
Yu'er.

467
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,320
Do you know

468
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,120
that Han Yue

469
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,800
was the Left General-in-Chief
of the Jinwu Guards?

470
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
He was prestigious and powerful.

471
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,240
Anyone who can eat pastry

472
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
that he personally made

473
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
is not an ordinary person.

474
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,160
And there are very few children

475
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,840
who have that honor.

476
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,440
That's great.

477
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,720
If I follow that clue

478
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,320
and investigate,

479
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,400
will I be able to know

480
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,520
my identity?

481
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

482
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,160
Aren't you happy for me?

483
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,680
No.

484
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm very happy.

485
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
I'll secretly check
at the Resume Vault tomorrow

486
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,640
and see what I can find out.

487
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,480
Let's go to sleep.

488
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
(She was born
into a high official's family,)

489
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
(became an orphan,)

490
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,760
(was adopted by Cheng Xi,)

491
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,680
(and entered the palace for eight years.)

492
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,680
(Could she be a descendant
of a loyal official who was killed)

493
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,000
(during the Morning Dew Rebellion?)

494
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,400
(Then...)

495
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,680
(Then it's very possible)

496
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,240
(that I personally killed people
in her family,)

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
(her clan,)

498
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,200
(and her household.)

499
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,960
Reporting!

500
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,400
There's news from Hedong.

501
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,480
It's very urgent.

502
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,280
Sir.

503
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,360
Good.

504
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Very good.

505
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,880
Very good!

506
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,320
Internal issues and external enemies

507
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,520
are here at the same time.

508
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,400
Let's have a fight to the death then!

509
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,239
Well...

510
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,400
Zhang Jiang

511
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,639
really has a death wish.

512
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,600
- Right, sir.
- Right, sir.

513
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,360
- Sir, give your command.
- Sir, give your command.

514
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,880
- Sir, kill Zhang Jiang.
- Sir, kill Zhang Jiang.

515
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,360
Give your command
to mobilize the troops.

516
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
Give your command, sir.

517
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,520
Your Majesty.

518
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,240
(Memorial to the Throne)

519
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Official Li Deyun

520
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,920
told me to inform you

521
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,880
that Zhang Jiang brought the remnants
of Lucong's rebels

522
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,680
to cause trouble at our borders.

523
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,080
The situation is very urgent.

524
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,960
In the past few days,

525
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,400
Zhang Jiang repeatedly asked
for the tally and ceremonial axe.

526
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,800
The imperial court was intentionally
ignoring and delaying him.

527
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,160
Of course he was displeased.

528
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,080
I've been to Lucong before.

529
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Yet I never expected

530
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,520
that he'd be so unbridled.

531
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,360
He's starting a war again so soon.

532
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,240
If I had expected this,

533
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,240
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

534
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,960
Zhang Jiang is very ambitious.

535
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,960
He has unfathomable motives.

536
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,640
I've long expected this,

537
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
but I still couldn't stop him

538
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,080
from starting this war.

539
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,000
Why do you say so?

540
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,320
Zhang Jiang declared himself
as Lucong's military commissioner,

541
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,880
acted in bad faith,

542
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,880
defied his superiors, created trouble,

543
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,040
and kept putting pressure on us.

544
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,440
And Xing seems strong,

545
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,200
but is actually weak.

546
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,040
The prefectures

547
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,480
kept making intrusions.

548
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,400
This war

549
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,920
is inevitable.

550
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,880
But it's all because I'm useless.

551
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,040
I don't think you're useless.

552
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,400
Don't worry.

553
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,000
I already have a plan to resolve this.

554
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,160
This won't do!

555
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,320
Please mobilize the troops.

556
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,840
How can they be a match
for the prefecture's troops?

557
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,480
If we go into war now,

558
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,720
the military forces and provisions

559
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,880
won't be enough, sir!

560
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,000
What if...

561
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,960
What if we negotiate peace?

562
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,600
Give Zhang Jiang the title
of military commissioner,

563
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,000
then let him marry a princess.

564
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
What do you think?

565
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,200
- Right.
- Right.

566
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,520
- Sir, negotiate peace.
- Yes.

567
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,160
- Sir.
- Sir.

568
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,920
Let's have an inter-marriage with him.

569
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
That can work.

570
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,920
Sir.

571
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,520
Sir, think about it.

572
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,000
You may go.

573
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,360
Yes.

574
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,600
You may all go.

575
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,720
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

576
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,320
Sir.

577
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
Call the divine healer.

578
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,880
Actually, movement
in the Qihai meridian is good.

579
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,600
It means that in taking the pill
and practicing martial arts,

580
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,360
you've made a breakthrough again.

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,800
It's suitable to train in isolation.

582
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,240
However,

583
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,960
the current timing isn't right.

584
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,560
There are internal issues
and external enemies.

585
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,560
At this time,

586
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
how can I train calmly in isolation?

587
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Is Left Chariot back?

588
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
War is raging everywhere.

589
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,040
The roads are destroyed.

590
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
He sent a letter saying
that he'll get delayed for a few days.

591
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,320
It seems like

592
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,960
Zhenwu and Lucong

593
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
discussed this together.

594
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,480
I can't rely

595
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,800
on these useless people.

596
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,320
However,

597
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,040
I can't let Li Deyun handle it.

598
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Li Deyun must have gotten news

599
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,280
from Lucong already.

600
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,520
Convey my order.

601
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,360
Say that His Majesty isn't feeling well

602
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
and needs to rest.

603
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
He's relieved from all state affairs.

604
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,760
Officials can't go to see him.

605
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,360
At this point,

606
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
don't let His Majesty meet Li Deyun.

607
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,040
Yes.

608
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,320
Your Majesty.

609
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,560
Why are you so anxious?

610
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,200
Come, have a seat.

611
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,240
Here.

612
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,480
Have some tea.

613
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
What did Li Deyun tell you?

614
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,400
How did you know

615
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
that Official Li sent me news?

616
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,480
Xiongwu Army Envoy Zhang Zhongru

617
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
especially sent military officers
to Heng'an

618
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,960
to meet Official Li

619
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,280
requesting him to lead troops
and fight against Zhang Jiang.

620
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,760
What did Li Deyun

621
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,280
tell them?

622
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,040
Official Li said

623
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
that Chen Yintai and Zhang Jiang

624
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,080
led mutinies without reporting it first.

625
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,000
They can't be utilized.

626
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,600
But Zhang Zhongru is different.

627
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,600
He reported it to show his sincerity.

628
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,760
His sincerity is evident
in making it known.

629
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,840
That's why he can be utilized.

630
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,280
What do you think?

631
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,160
We can't stay in Lucong anymore.

632
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,120
People just keep

633
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,720
starting wars.

634
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,480
It's the same no matter who's leading.

635
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,160
They have no regard

636
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,720
for our lives.

637
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm afraid

638
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,560
that I won't be able
to hang in there anymore.

639
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,880
Mother.

640
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,640
Endure it a bit longer.

641
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
Five more kilometers,

642
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,560
and we'll arrive

643
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,280
in Official Zhang Zhongru's turf.

644
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,760
It's more peaceful there.

645
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
They'll give us food there.

646
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,520
When I went to Lucong before,

647
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,320
I've heard about Zhang Zhongru.

648
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,320
The Zhang family has been in Lucong
for many generations.

649
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,600
They're very well-respected.

650
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,880
When citizens got displaced
due to war,

651
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,200
Zhang Zhongru automatically
took the citizens in.

652
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,280
He has the citizens' support.

653
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,520
They've been stationed there
for many generations.

654
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,680
They're very well-respected.

655
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,240
The Zhang family

656
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,920
might also want to make Lucong

657
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
their own territory

658
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
and do whatever they want.

659
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,080
I think

660
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,680
that he's better

661
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,360
than Chen Yintai and Zhang Jiang.

662
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,520
Chen Yintai and Zhang Jiang

663
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,200
were just passersby

664
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,960
in Lucong.

665
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,720
They didn't treat it as their hometown.

666
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,680
Yet to Zhang Zhongru, Lucong is like

667
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,600
what Heng'an means to me.

668
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,480
This is my home.

669
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,240
I want

670
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
my hometown to become better

671
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,600
and peaceful.

672
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,120
All right.

673
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,520
Come.

674
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,720
Look here.

675
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Zhang Jiang's troops

676
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,520
already reached this place.

677
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,200
The local army in the borders
has always been useless.

678
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,200
It's normal
that they couldn't block them.

679
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,160
What about the Shencai Army?

680
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,880
Qiu Ziliang already sent

681
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,600
the Shencai Army's main force elsewhere.

682
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,200
They can't take care
of two things at once.

683
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,560
Your Majesty.

684
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,640
Why don't you send me

685
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,440
