Although the Wang Family was massacred,

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,600
our ancestors lived in
Jiannan, Dongchuan,

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,840
for a certain period.

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
I suppose our old servants
are still there.

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,680
I had another headache just now.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
I think it's because

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
my childhood memories
were gradually recovering.

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
But they were blurry
and felt unreal to me.

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,520
That's why I plan to visit the place

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
and ask the old servants about my past.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
Maybe it would help me out.

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,040
I wore the phoenix coronet

They do.

We were supposed to put the hairpin on

you are putting on the hairpin for me.

Dongchuan has a harsh climate.

71

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,440

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,840

regarding Eunuch Qiu yet.

You haven't received any news yet?

94
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,880
Have you found Sister?

95
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,920
No.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
And there is no news

97
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
from the Qiu Residence.

98
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
Qiu Ziliang is ruthless and tyrannical.

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,240
If he found out that Cheng Ruoyu

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
was Wang Ruoling,

101
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
and Yanzhi didn't tell him the truth,

102
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
he would surely be enraged.

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
He would erupt in rage.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
Maybe,

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,800
your sister isn't in his hands.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,440
Or maybe,

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
your sister is in his hands,

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,440
but she hasn't told him

109
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
the truth regarding Yu'er yet.

110
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Do you plan to keep quiet?

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,680
There's nothing for me to say.

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Is Cheng Ruoyu the same person
as Ling Ling?

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
Is Ling Ling the same person
as Wang Ruoling?

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,880
I've told you many times.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,160
Cheng Ruoyu is dead.

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
As for Ling Ling's identity,

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,320
you should ask Qiu Yanzhi.

118
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
Why are you asking me?

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,320
How dare you be stubborn
when you're in this situation?

120
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,120
I knew that Prince Guang

121
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,120
was the Right Minister long ago.

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,600
He is your little brother as well.

123
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,440
He was cruel

124
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,560
towards you.

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,920
Why are you still covering up for him?

126
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,240
I don't know what you are saying.

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
It's useless for you to keep quiet.

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,200
I've been investigating you guys
in secret for the past few days.

129
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I've found out

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,680
plenty of interesting secrets.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
Once I get my hands on Wang Ruoling,

132
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
all of you will get to enjoy

133
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,799
Master's wrath!

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,560
Even if I have fallen out with them,

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm the daughter of the Qi Family.

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,480
I will never be the lackey
of a wretched eunuch.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,560
Only I

138
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,920
can hurt Cheng Ruoyu.

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,000
Your Majesty,

140
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,800
Prince Guang has arrived.

141
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Your Majesty.

142
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,600
I was supposed to be dead long ago.

143
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Now, I'm grateful for
every day I'm alive.

144
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,400
Uncle,

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
there's no need for you to be sad.

146
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Uncle, I called you here today

147
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
because of the matter
we had discussed previously.

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,720
Uncle, I hope you can agree to it.

149
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,730
(I hereby pass the throne
to Prince Guang)

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,040
I

151
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,080
still reject the notion of it.

152
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,200
Qiu Ziliang

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,560
wishes to use Qiu Yanzhi to
imitate the female emperor.

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
And I will use my death

155
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
to pave the road for you, Uncle.

156
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
Your Majesty, what do you plan to do?

157
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
During my wedding,

158
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
we will propose a toast.

159
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,200
My cup,

160
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,920
Qiu Ziliang's cup and Qiu Yanzhi's cup

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,440
will be laced with poison.

162
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,200
You mustn't do so!

163
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
Qiu Ziliang is skeptical.

164
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
If I propose a toast to him

165
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,840
in front of everyone else,

166
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
he will not be suspicious.

167
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,280
You mustn't do so!

168
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,440
Uncle,

169
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,600
after our deaths,

170
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
you should take out

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,960
the imperial edict.

172
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,800
I'll leave everything to you now.

173
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,120
Your Majesty!

174
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,120
You mustn't do so!

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,480
The situation isn't that serious yet.

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,800
How is the situation not serious enough?

177
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,360
How is the situation not serious enough?

178
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
If Yanzhi becomes the empress,

179
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,600
she will control the imperial court.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,360
By then, we will have no way

181
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
to oppose them.

182
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Yanzhi wouldn't do so.

183
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,040
But why?

184
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,720
Uncle.

185
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
Because Yanzhi is...

186
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,000
She is my old acquaintance.

187
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,640
Uncle,

188
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,000
don't forget,

189
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,520
Yanzhi betrayed Han Yue in the past.

190
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Your Majesty,

191
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,240
I trust her

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
like I trust myself.

193
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,520
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
you must never do so.

195
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Although dying together with
your enemies is a satisfying outcome,

196
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,760
to the imperial court,

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,160
the pillar will be broken

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
and its core will be shattered.

199
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,560
Your Majesty, please rescind your edict.

200
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
What do you think?

201
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,520
Your Majesty,

202
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
in my opinion,

203
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
it's either Prince Guang

204
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
is open-minded

205
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,160
and he doesn't want
to take over the throne,

206
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,120
or he's...

207
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
Follow the lead, assuming
that Qiu Yanzhi

208
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,400
is Wang Ruoqing,
and investigate the case.

209
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Your Majesty, do you really think
she's Wang Ruoqing?

210
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,800
Initially, I was suspicious
of her identity as Wang Ruoqing.

211
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,640
But now,

212
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,000
I only need one more piece of evidence
to prove that she's Wang Ruoqing.

213
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,140
(I hereby pass the throne
to Prince Guang)

214
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,400
(Chess of Generals Camp)

215
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,040
During my patrol,

216
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,240
I realised that many of the soldiers

217
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
are away.

218
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,080
How many of them?

219
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,280
There were 13 of them.

220
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,080
All of them

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,680
aren't on duty today.

222
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,840
They were here this morning.

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
But now, all of them are missing.

224
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,520
The soldiers of the
Chess of Generals Camp

225
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,320
will never leave the camp
without permission.

226
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
I did some investigating as well.

227
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
The Left Chariot isn't

228
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,040
on duty as well.

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,680
Who's there?

230
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,360
(Left Chariot)

231
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,920
You are the Left Chariot?

232
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Take her down.

233
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,320
Run!

234
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Who are you?

235
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,200
Stop asking questions!

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,080
Just run!

237
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,600
For the first step,

238
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,760
I will use Gao Ping

239
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
to tell Qiu Ziliang,
who is on an isolated meditation,

240
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,840
that I am dead.

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
It's no wonder Your Majesty
is keeping Gao Ping by your side.

242
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,040
For the second step,

243
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,040
my spy

244
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
will try to influence Qiu Ziliang

245
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
and make him think that I am almost dead

246
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,320
and Prince Guang isn't reliable.

247
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,920
Qiu Ziliang

248
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
will force Yanzhi to marry Your Majesty.

249
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,600
His rule will only be stable

250
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,480
once Yanzhi becomes the empress.

251
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,480
So,

252
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,319
Qiu Ziliang

253
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,720
will force me to marry Qiu Yanzhi soon.

254
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,040
That way...

255
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,640
That way,

256
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
the third person's strategy,

257
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,960
Prince Guang's strategy

258
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,000
will be ruined.

259
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,480
If he wants to

260
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,760
take over the throne,

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
he will stop Yanzhi from
marrying Your Majesty.

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Or maybe,

263
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,000
he will work together with Qiu Yanzhi

264
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,960
and get rid of Qiu Ziliang
as soon as possible.

265
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,680
Your Majesty is using your opponent's
momentum against another opponent.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Your Majesty will kill
two birds with one stone.

267
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
All of this is happening

268
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,560
because of the throne.

269
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,000
I will die soon.

270
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
I can finally free myself

271
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,840
from the battle of the throne.

272
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,040
That way,

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,000
it'll become a battle between
Prince Guang

274
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,080
and Qiu Ziliang.

275
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,400
So,

276
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,840
the closer we get to this moment,

277
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,760
the clearer we can see.

278
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
We can see what exactly he wants.

279
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Your Majesty,

280
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,040
I have a question for you.

281
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,560
What is my role

282
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
in this strategy?

283
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,600
(Yu'er,)

284
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,360
(you will leave Heng'an City
temporarily.)

285
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,160
(You will shift their attention
from me.)

286
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,040
(It will be a perilous trip.)

287
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
(But at the same time,)

288
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
(you'll be able to see things clearly.)

289
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,880
(For example?)

290
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,720
(For example, you can find out)

291
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,600
(Qiu Yanzhi's true intention.)

292
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,800
The Left Chariot isn't in his room.

293
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm sure he has discovered something.

294
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I assume he's trying
to capture Ling Ling.

295
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,560
Pawn Seven?

296
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,480
Didn't I send you to protect Ling Ling?

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
The Left Chariot ambushed us!

298
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,360
He has the Chess of Generals' Seal.

299
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,600
The Left Chariot was behind this indeed.

300
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,680
Only the Chess Overseer will be able

301
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
to possess the Chess of Generals' Seal.

302
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,120
Why would Eunuch Qiu give it to him?

303
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,920
Not just Ling Ling,

304
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
my identity was exposed as well.

305
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
But judging from
Eunuch Qiu's personality,

306
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,480
if he found out about this,

307
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm sure he will send

308
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
more soldiers after her.

309
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,840
So, according to my guess,

310
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
he hasn't told Qiu Ziliang

311
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,760
the truth yet.

312
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,600
But why?

313
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,080
He doesn't have any solid evidence.

314
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,320
Yan Xiu,

315
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,600
go and save Ling Ling.

316
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
I will find Qiu Ziliang

317
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,600
and verify the situation.

318
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,680
All right.

319
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,680
Someone!

320
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,440
Chess Overseer,

321
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,480
what's the matter?

322
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,160
How is Father?

323
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
Eunuch Qiu is still
on an isolated meditation.

324
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,000
Father,

325
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
how are you?

326
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,200
I missed you.

327
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I was reckless.

328
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Father, please forgive me.

329
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
Why aren't you leaving

330
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,040
when you knew that
you were bothering me?

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,680
Yes, Father.

332
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,440
Chess Overseer.

333
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,800
Keep an eye on them,

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,120
especially the Left Chariot.

335
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,920
Understood.

336
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,480
(Ruoling,)

337
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,080
(please be safe.)

338
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,600
Left Chariot?

339
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,680
Left Advisor, why are you here?

340
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,120
Why did you leave your post
without permission?

341
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm doing my duty.

342
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,040
But it seems like you and
the Chess Overseer

343
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
have done something
that you were not supposed to.

344
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,520
Save your breath.

345
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Surrender yourself.

346
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,180
(Chess of Generals Camp)

347
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,160
Greetings, Chess Overseer.

348
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,160
During the battle of the soldiers,

349
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
all of the other soldiers were dead.

350
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
You were the only one left alive.

351
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
So,

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,320
you still remember me.

353
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
I didn't expect you

354
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,800
to become the Left Chariot

355
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
in such a short amount of time.

356
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,160
Now, you even want to replace me.

357
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Speak.

358
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
Tell me what you know,

359
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,640
what information you have,

360
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,680
and what you are going to tell Father.

361
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
Are you afraid?

362
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,120
That is

363
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,680
supposed to be my question.

364
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
I'm unafraid of death.

365
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,680
Because once I die,

366
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,840
Master will know everything.

367
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
The secret about Wang Ruoling,

368
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,040
Prince Guang,

369
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,120
and you.

370
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,320
So, that means

371
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,680
Father still has no idea about them.

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
Take a guess.

373
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,760
What do you want?

374
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,040
I told you already.

375
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,440
Take a guess.

376
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,280
You are the one panicking here, not me.

377
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,880
Where is Ling Ling?

378
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,320
Take a guess.

379
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,920
If you dare to touch her,

380
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,440
I will make you suffer a fate
worse than death.

381
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,400
Such is the sisters' bond.

382
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,240
What a touching scene.

383
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,880
I will ask you one last time.

384
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,000
What exactly do you want?

385
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,320
How did it feel

386
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,480
when you framed the Right Knight

387
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,240
and he had to commit suicide
because of the crime he didn't commit?

388
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
I'm the little brother of
the Right Knight.

389
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,760
Just like

390
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,880
how Wang Ruoling is your little sister.

391
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,320
Wang

392
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,920
Ruo

393
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,520
Qing.

394
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,640
Wang Ruoqing, it's too late.

395
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
The truth wouldn't have been verified

396
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,920
if you didn't capture me.

397
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,640
With Eunuch Qiu's love and trust in you,

398
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,960
you would've been able to
salvage the situation.

399
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,880
But now,

400
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,280
you're done for.

401
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,480
Checkmate.

402
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,520
Xiu.

403
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,920
- Yes.
- Do me a favour.

404
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,600
What is it?

405
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,680
Find Ruoling

406
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,480
and protect her.

407
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,940
(Chess of Generals Camp)

408
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,600
(Chess of Generals Camp)

409
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,040
(Chess of Generals Camp)

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,160
I need to speak to Father.

411
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
What a great game.

412
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,160
Yanzhi,

413
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,960
let us start the next match.

414
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,000
Wait,

415
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
I mean, you should invite
the Right Minister

416
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
to join you

417
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
to go against me.

418
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,720
Someone.

419
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes, sir.

420
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Summon the Right Minister.

421
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,960
Understood.

422
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,720
My good daughter.

423
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,280
Have a seat.

424
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,400
You are a good girl.

425
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,240
You are an exceptional girl.

426
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,680
Since young, you concealed
your ability and bided your time.

427
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,560
You endured hardships
to achieve your purpose.

428
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,640
You did everything you can

429
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
to come to my side

430
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,080
and made me dote on you,

431
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,560
trust you,

432
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,360
and made you

433
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,000
my successor.

434
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,080
You're a genius.

435
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,920
That arrogant and useless coward,

436
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,280
Wang Yang,

437
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,680
how did he manage

438
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,960
to get a magnificent
granddaughter like you?

439
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,640
No.

440
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
Not a granddaughter.

441
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
It's a pair of granddaughters.

442
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,040
Little Fish,

443
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,640
also known as Wang Ruoling.

444
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,240
She's the little sister of Wang Ruoqing.

445
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
She's entirely different from you.

446
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,720
She is unyielding,

447
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,760
frank,

448
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,920
and she shines brightly.

449
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm happy

450
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,440
that both of you are still alive.

451
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,800
This is the best thing
that had happened to me

452
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,360
ever since I went on
an isolated meditation.

453
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,520
I see the light now.

454
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,560
What is the light?

455
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,320
The light represents hope.

456
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,040
The light represents intelligence.

457
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,640
Do you understand?

458
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,800
Father, please execute me.

459
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,920
Father,

460
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,200
I know

461
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,800
that death is the biggest mercy
you can show me.

462
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,280
I'm not worthy enough to die.

463
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,840
Ruoqing,

464
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,480
you do understand me indeed.

465
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,040
I can do anything you want.

466
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,240
I just hope

467
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,320
that you can give Ruoling an easy death.

468
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,880
Right Minister, you are finally here.

469
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,480
No.

470
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,080
I should refer to you
as Your Highness Prince Guang.

471
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
You heard her, right?

472
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,200
Wang Ruoqing said

473
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,840
she wanted me to grant her sister
an easy death.

474
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
What do you think?

475
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
I wish for the same thing.

476
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,200
So, both of you are saying

477
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,200
that I can order the two of you

478
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,840
to do anything I want?

479
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Yes.

480
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,360
Both of you are great.

481
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,200
Both of you are great children.

482
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,840
That person named Thirteen

483
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,800
wanted me to descend into madness

484
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,280
by giving me the mystic treatise.

485
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,200
My goddaughter,

486
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
who referred to me as her godfather,

487
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
was biding her time
to exact revenge on me.

488
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,720
I think

489
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,320
I treated you guys well enough.

490
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
But what about you two?

491
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,000
Look at the two of you.

492
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,320
Now, you will get a taste

493
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,280
of my ruthlessness.

494
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,560
Yanzhi.

495
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,800
Did you call her Yanzhi?

496
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,480
Within a quarter of an hour,

497
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,920
the rope will be burned.

498
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,560
A pot of boiling oil

499
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,000
will descend from the top.

500
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,120
You guys can take your time.

501
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Life and death

502
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
are just like a game of chess.

503
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,840
You still have a chance to turn back.

504
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,360
Since that's the case,

505
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
you should give birth
to the next emperor soon.

506
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,640
Qi Yan is dying.

507
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,600
Giving birth to the next emperor
is your only choice.

508
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,400
Yanzhi,

509
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,320
you need to understand that.

510
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,400
If you want to marry Qi Yan,

511
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
I will give you my full support.

512
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,200
If you want to reclaim the land
which belongs to the Qi Family,

513
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,200
I will assist your son

514
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,120
to become the next emperor.

515
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,160
I've done all I can for you.

516
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,280
Am I right?

517
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,120
As for Prince Guang,

518
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,240
you've been the Right Minister
for many years.

519
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,760
You can stay in your position.

520
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,680
You can help me

521
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,640
assist Yanzhi's son

522
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,520
to become the next emperor.

523
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,040
This task

524
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
is beneficial to you.

525
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,920
Anyway,

526
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,360
I know you two are intelligent.

527
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,680
I only

528
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,040
make acquaintance
with intelligent people.

529
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Intelligent people

530
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,360
don't care about their dignity.

531
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,920
They only care about

532
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,280
their growth.

533
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,040
They won't go out of their way

534
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,320
to prove that they're right.

535
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,760
So,

536
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
I will give you two another chance.

537
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,320
(Virtuous and prestigious)

538
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,920
(Virtuous and prestigious)

539
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,560
(Wang Ruoqing,)

540
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
(Wang Ruoling,)

541
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,200
(Qi Yan,)

542
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,160
(Qi Chen,)

543
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,480
(how dare the four of you
treat me like a fool?)

544
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,200
(If I don't return the favour
a hundredfold,)

545
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,440
(I won't be able to call myself)

546
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,040
(as the number one ruler in the world.)

547
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,360
(I will keep all of you alive.)

548
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,640
(I will torture all of you
physically and mentally.)

549
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,400
(I will take my time
to play with you all.)

550
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,960
Your Majesty.

551
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,200
This is great.

552
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,200
Come, Your Majesty.

553
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Please have another sip.

554
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Sorry for the offence.

555
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,000
Here.

556
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,200
Have another sip.

557
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,160
All of you may leave.

558
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,160
Qi Yan,

559
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,640
I am here to visit you.

560
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,600
How are you?

561
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,320
I'm going to die soon.

562
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,040
Everything means nothing to me.

563
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,560
You shouldn't have done this

564
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,400
when you knew this would happen.

565
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Qi Yan,

566
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I just want to tell you this.

567
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,320
At any time, you and I

568
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,960
are on the same boat.

569
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,640
It's just that we had some
minor disagreements with each other.

570
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,040
That's why we suspected
and resented each other.

571
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,960
That's why outsiders
took advantage of the situation.

572
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,880
We got on the same boat
because of profit.

573
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,120
Naturally, we will part
with each other because of profit.

574
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,120
You're right.

575
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,120
That's why,

576
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,720
we need to tame the beast

577
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,640
since young.

578
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,360
What do you plan to do?

579
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,880
You don't need to know.

580
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,520
Just rest well.

581
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,080
I have prepared a show for you.

582
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,520
I can't be the only one

583
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,760
to have my heart broken,

584
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,400
am I right?

585
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
What do you say?

586
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,120
Godfather.

587
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,640
All of us deserved our retribution.

588
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
But I beg you.

589
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,240
Please let Yu'er off.

590
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,200
Do you think

591
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,320
that is possible?

592
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,920
Godfather.

593
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,360
Godfather,

594
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,480
I beg you.

595
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,480
It's all my fault.

596
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,320
I beg you, please let her off.

597
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,680
Let me think about it.

598
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,160
Godfather.

599
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,960
Godfather!

600
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,440
Godfather!

601
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,480
Godfather!

602
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,800
Godfather!

603
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,680
Godfather!

604
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,640
Godfather!

605
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,680
Godfather!

606
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,560
I beg you!

607
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,240
It's all my fault!

608
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,880
Your Majesty.

609
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,800
Your Majesty!

610
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,560
Your Majesty!

611
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,960
Your Majesty, I deserve to die!

612
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,760
- Godfather.
- Your Majesty, I deserve to die!

613
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,680
Your Majesty!

614
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,520
Ruoqing.

615
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,800
I almost killed Qiu Ziliang

616
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,960
when I worked together with Han Yue.

617
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,280
I could've killed him.

618
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,560
I still lost in the end.

619
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,600
General Han's sacrifice was in vain.

620
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,840
Qiu Ziliang is still alive.

621
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,440
I should've known.

622
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,120
He is a devil.
