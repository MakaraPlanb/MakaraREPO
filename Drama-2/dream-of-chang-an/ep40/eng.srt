to treat his injury.

189
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
If anyone enters his chamber,

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,960
he'll execute them!

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
Divine healer,

192
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,880
please return for now.

193
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
Divine healer, please.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,560
Have you found Ruoling?

195
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
She left with Cheng Xi's subordinate.

196
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,360
But don't worry.

197
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,160
We can catch up with them.

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,960
Who's there?

199
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Leave the person in the carriage here.

200
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
Sorry, but no can do.

201
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
I will repeat this one last time.

202
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,400
Leave the person in the carriage here.

203
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,160
Sorry for the offense.

204
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,280
Yu'er.

205
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
I knew you would come to save me.

206
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
We shouldn't stay here for long.

207
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Let's go to another place.

208
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,400
Yu'er,

209
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,480
have a seat.

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
What do you plan to do in the future?

211
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Here.

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,040
Have some tea.

213
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,320
What about you?

214
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
I don't know.

215
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,360
Yu'er,

216
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,760
do you think that I took you in

217
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,160
because I harbored
ulterior motives towards you?

218
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
I had no choice.

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,760
Now, with our strength,

220
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,080
it's impossible for us

221
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,280
to go against the current emperor.

222
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,720
That's why

223
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,920
I tried to use you to seduce him.

224
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,760
You used me to seduce him?

225
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,960
That's right.

226
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,600
Qi Yan is a cautious person.

227
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
He has great martial arts as well.

228
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
It's hard for ordinary people
to get close to him.

229
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
But you are different.

230
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,160
You are naive,

231
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,200
innocent,

232
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,840
brave and straightforward.

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,080
Anyone who spends enough time with you

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,680
will fall for you.

235
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,040
That's why I always taught you

236
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
to be loyal to His Majesty.

237
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,720
Indeed,

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
Qi Yan did fall for you in the end.

239
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,600
What do you want?

240
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,800
What do you want me to do?

241
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,480
Of course I wish to
seek revenge against him.

242
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,280
I will never be able to kill Qi Yan.

243
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
His Majesty did fall for me,

244
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,080
and I fell for him as well.

245
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,360
Aunt,

246
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
this is a double-edged sword.

247
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
It's fine even if you won't kill him.

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,600
But you must retrieve

249
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
the things that belong to me.

250
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,760
Do you mean the throne?

251
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,160
It's our family's reputation.

252
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,480
Only by obtaining the throne

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
will we be able to
restore the reputation of my father

254
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,560
and your family.

255
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,040
Don't you wish

256
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,280
to redress
your grandfather's grievances?

257
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't you wish

258
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,560
to restore your identity
as Wang Ruoling officially?

259
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,680
Yu'er,

260
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
follow me.

261
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,560
As long as you and I work together,

262
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
we will be able to achieve great feats.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,560
I know.

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
My arrangement had hurt you.

265
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,760
To achieve my goal,

266
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
I've executed all kinds of dirty tricks.

267
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,120
But why would I do so

268
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,240
if there were a better way
of going about it?

269
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Who will be able to understand
the grievances in my heart?

270
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
Madam Li did understand you.

271
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,320
You are right.

272
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Li Rong had been with me

273
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
for a long time.

274
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
She's the person
who understood me the most.

275
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
It's a pity

276
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
that she died

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,520
because of Qiu Yanzhi.

278
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,520
No.

279
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,840
Weren't you the one who was responsible

280
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
for Madam Li's death?

281
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
What do you mean?

282
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,160
Since you had written a letter to me,

283
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
why did you ask Madam Li

284
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,599
to wait for me at the wine store?

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
Li Rong wanted to see you.

286
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,000
She brought the letter with her.

287
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,359
Back then, I was cautious

288
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
on my way to the wine store.

289
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
I avoided the hidden sentries
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

290
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,160
If so,

291
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,319
how did Qiu Yanzhi manage to find me?

292
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,160
Fine.

293
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,120
Let's treat it as my mistake.

294
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,680
What about today?

295
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
How did Qiu Yanzhi

296
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,920
manage to find me today?

297
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
What are you trying to say?

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,760
What?

299
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Have you changed your shoes?

300
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
Where is your previous pair of shoes?

301
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
I don't know what you are talking about.

302
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,440
Yu'er,

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,680
what are you trying to do?

304
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,240
When you brought me

305
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
to the wine store

306
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
and when we were chasing
after the carriage,

307
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,360
you wore a pair of shoes

308
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,000
with visible tracks during the night.

309
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,920
Why did you do so?

310
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,880
Tell me!

311
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Shi won't tell you anything.

312
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,240
Of course she won't tell me anything.

313
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,720
It's because you were the one

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,720
who made her do everything.

315
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
Why are you still following her orders?

316
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,880
Haven't you learned

317
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
from Madam Li's death?

318
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,320
Cheng Ruoyu,

319
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,680
what exactly are you up to?

320
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
I'm here today

321
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,840
just to ask you a question.

322
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,360
Were you the one

323
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
behind Madam Li's death?

324
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Prince Guang fell out with you.

325
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Qiu Ziliang plans to kill you.

326
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Zhang Jiang is dead.

327
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,640
You no longer have any martial arts.

328
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,320
Your power over Yuzhen Hall

329
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
has been greatly diminished.

330
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
That's why

331
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,840
you thought of me.

332
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,760
You wanted me
to kill His Majesty for you.

333
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,440
You wanted me to deal with Qiu Ziliang
and Prince Guang for you.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For your first step,

335
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,760
you needed to drive a wedge
between Yanzhi and I.

336
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
You let Shi brought me
to the wine store.

337
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
She wore the special pair
of shoes deliberately

338
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,520
to leave tracks behind,

339
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,960
so that Yanzhi can follow her tracks
to our whereabouts

340
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,840
and kill Madam Li,

341
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,240
am I right?

342
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,160
In the end,

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,720
I was desperate

344
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,120
and I had nowhere to go.

345
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,000
I had no choice but to follow you,

346
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
am I right?

347
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,040
Aunt,

348
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,080
Madam Li

349
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
followed you for over 10 years.

350
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
How could you bear to do that to her?

351
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,960
Qiu Yanzhi was the one
who killed Li Rong.

352
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,520
It had nothing to do with me.

353
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,080
Even if I did make the arrangement,

354
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
and Qiu Yanzhi did find her,

355
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,800
she could've arrested Li Rong

356
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
instead of killing her.

357
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
If so,

358
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
why did you
prepare the letter beforehand?

359
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,720
Didn't you prepare the letter beforehand

360
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
because you knew Madam Li would die

361
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,960
before she could pass the message to me?

362
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
Qi Yan and Qiu Ziliang

363
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,800
had slaughtered your entire family,

364
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,200
yet you're not seeking revenge
against them.

365
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,200
Qiu Yanzhi had killed Li Rong,

366
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,080
yet you're not seeking revenge
against her.

367
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,520
After everything that happened,

368
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,320
you actually came here
to interrogate me instead?

369
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,960
Since you are sure

370
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
that I was the mastermind

371
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,920
behind Li Rong's death,

372
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,600
then go ahead.

373
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,160
Kill me.

374
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
Since I no longer have any martial arts,

375
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
I won't be able to defend myself.

376
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,840
You should watch out.

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,160
Did you drug me?

378
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
I no longer have any martial arts.

379
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,280
Of course

380
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,560
I need to be wary of you.

381
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,040
I will never work for you.

382
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,560
Everything will be much easier

383
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
as long as I have you as my hostage.

384
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
What is this?

385
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
This box contains

386
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,000
the map to the Chess of
Generals Camp's hidden constructions,

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,080
the members' profiles
and their training data.

388
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,400
Cheng Xi has stolen them.

389
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,160
No wonder Cheng Xi knew how to use

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,000
the secret passage to abduct Ruoling.

391
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,520
I am very sorry.

392
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,560
She is your biological sister after all.

393
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,360
If I were in your shoes,

394
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,880
I wouldn't know what to do
with her either.

395
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
Ruoling was abducted by her.

396
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,360
This bodes ill for her.

397
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,440
Although she wouldn't die,

398
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,280
Cheng Xi will

399
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
surely use her

400
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
to deal with Qi Yan.

401
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,280
His Majesty just suffered from a shock.

402
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,920
He has locked himself up
within his chamber.

403
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,280
He isn't willing to see anyone.

404
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,680
Qi Yan mustn't die yet.

405
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,800
The doer needs to undo what he has done.

406
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,560
Ruoling will never forgive him.

407
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,040
Hatred is a type of motivation as well.

408
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,040
Now, our priority

409
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,200
is to locate Ruoling

410
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
and save her as soon as possible.

411
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
We need to let Qi Yan
see her as soon as possible.

412
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,840
Do you have an idea?

413
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,040
What if,

414
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,320
we let Cheng Xi know that
His Majesty has passed away?

415
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,640
If so, she will surely enter the palace
to investigate the truth.

416
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
But she's a cunning person.

417
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
She might not enter
the palace herself.

418
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,160
At this time,

419
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,880
she needs the help of someone else.

420
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,880
Cheng Huaizhi.

421
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Don't worry.

422
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
Ruoling

423
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
will return safely.

424
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
You shouldn't worry as well.

425
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,920
Ruoling is kind at heart.

426
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
She will forgive Qi Yan.

427
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,320
What about you?

428
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,480
Will you forgive His Majesty?

429
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
But I won't harm him.

430
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,920
Official Li.

431
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,160
Gentlemen, please return for now.

432
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
His Majesty doesn't wish to see anyone.

433
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Eunuch Cheng,

434
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,520
how is His Majesty's injury?

435
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,120
What did you say?

436
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
Cheng Huaizhi sealed off
His Majesty's chamber?

437
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
He doesn't allow anyone
to enter or exit the place?

438
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,080
That's right.

439
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,720
Not just the imperial officials,

440
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,240
even the maids and eunuchs

441
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,840
who were supposed to serve him

442
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
were chased away as well.

443
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't tell me Qi Yan died
because of the shock

444
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,400
he received from Yu'er?

445
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,800
Some of the maids
who had served him before

446
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,680
said in private

447
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
that His Majesty

448
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,200
was almost dead back then.

449
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,240
If he did die,

450
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,040
he would save me a lot of trouble.

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,720
Shi,

452
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,120
everyone else has betrayed me.

453
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,560
Now,

454
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,880
you are my only follower.

455
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,800
Madam, you saved me in the past.

456
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
I will follow you forever.

457
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,720
I did save

458
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,120
Yu'er before.

459
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,680
But what did I get in the end?

460
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,960
But it doesn't matter.

461
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm grateful that at least one of you

462
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,360
isn't an ingrate.

463
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,360
You will do anything for me,

464
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,800
am I right?

465
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Yes, Madam.

466
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,600
Bring someone back for me.

467
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,760
Who?

468
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,720
Bring my honest brother here.

469
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,520
Yes, Madam.

470
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,960
Brother,

471
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,200
are you awake?

472
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,280
I am awake.

473
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Where am I?

474
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
Why am I here?

475
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,880
Yu'er!

476
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
Brother, calm down.

477
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I brought you here

478
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,640
to ask you one question.

479
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,120
My people will send you back

480
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
once you answer my question.

481
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,920
I will never tell you anything.

482
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,360
Seems like all of you

483
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,120
are loyal towards Qi Yan.

484
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,760
Why didn't you tell me

485
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,240
that Yu'er is Wang Ruoling?

486
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
Why?

487
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,280
So what if I told you about it?

488
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,640
Do you want me to let you
prepare in advance

489
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,960
so that the two of them
won't fall for each other?

490
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
But you knew

491
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,240
that the two granddaughters of Wang Yang

492
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,520
were shot and killed by His Majesty.

493
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,720
Yet, you still did so.

494
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
You are extremely vicious.

495
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
You are out of your mind!

496
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,120
Is that so?

497
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
Brother, it's all thanks to you.

498
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Brother, you were the one who saved me,

499
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,600
brought me to the Heng'an City,

500
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,560
and brought me into the palace.

501
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,200
Now that I think about it,

502
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,360
I was able to achieve all of this

503
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,360
because of you, Brother.

504
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,960
Just kill me.

505
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,800
I won't kill you.

506
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
I will repay you.

507
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,320
Once I achieve my goal,

508
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,320
I will make you the general.

509
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,600
I will make you the next Duke Chu.

510
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,840
You will be as mighty as Qiu Ziliang.

511
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Tell me.

512
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
Is Qi Yan dead?

513
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,360
No.

514
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
That is nonsense!

515
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,240
To Official Li,

516
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,680
please meet me in private
before midnight.

517
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Why are you looking for Li Deyun?

518
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,960
It's nothing.

519
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,200
Seems like

520
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,720
Qi Yan is dead.

521
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,720
No.

522
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,760
Nonsense.

523
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,280
His Majesty is alive.

524
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,080
His Majesty is still alive!

525
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,160
Brother,

526
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,640
where is the imperial jade seal?

527
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,240
I have no idea.

528
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,480
Brother,

529
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
I don't want to torture you.

530
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,760
You better know what's good for you

531
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,520
and hand over the seal.

532
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,520
Why are you doing this?

533
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,920
What are you up to?

534
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,960
Of course I'm going to set things right

535
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
and restore order to the nation.

536
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,440
Don't forget,

537
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,920
Prince Guang was supposed to
ascend the throne.

538
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,280
Qi Yan was the one
who stole his throne from him.

539
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,320
Now that he's dead,

540
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,520
it's time for Prince Guang
to take back his rightful throne.

541
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,680
But Prince Guang

542
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,960
doesn't want to be the emperor.

543
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
And Qiu Ziliang

544
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,640
might not agree with your plan.

545
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,400
With the imperial edict,

546
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,560
Prince Guang has to ascend the throne
no matter he likes it or not.

547
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,160
Qiu Ziliang is in
an isolated meditation.

548
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
We need to act swiftly.

549
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,120
I will ask you one last time.

550
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
Where is the imperial jade seal?

551
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,880
I have no idea.

552
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,200
Yu'er!

553
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,280
Yu'er,

554
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,480
did you hear everything?

555
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,360
Xi'er,

556
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,080
I beg of you.

557
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,840
Please let Yu'er off.

558
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,320
Brother,

559
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,120
once you return to the palace,

560
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
I want you to come up
with a posthumous edict.

561
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,360
You are to pass the throne
to Prince Guang

562
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,320
under Qi Yan's name

563
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,520
and pass the edict to Prince Guang.

564
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,200
You must complete this task before dawn.

565
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,080
If not,

566
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,480
I will kill your niece.

567
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:18,960
Don't do this.

568
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,320
Although she's not your real niece,

569
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,320
judging by your personality,

570
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,480
I'm sure you can't bear to see her die.

571
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,600
Moreover,

572
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
she's the woman Qi Yan loved the most.

573
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,920
If Qi Yan was alive,

574
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
he'd have agree to my condition.

575
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,480
Send my brother back.

576
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,680
Keep an eye on him.

577
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Make sure the task is completed.

578
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,880
Yes, Madam.

579
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,440
Yu'er.

580
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,960
Yu'er!

581
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,840
Uncle.

582
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,760
Yu'er!

583
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,880
Yu'er!

584
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,920
Congratulations.

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,440
You have exacted half of your revenge.

586
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,800
Prince Guang?

587
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520
(My beloved aunt)

588
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,880
(actually ended up like this.)

589
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,880
Madam,

590
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,440
I've returned.

591
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,480
How's the progress?

592
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,840
Madam,

593
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
His Majesty is dead indeed.

594
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,920
What about the posthumous edict?

595
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,200
They've passed down the edict.

596
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,520
I suppose

597
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,720
they will announce it to the public

598
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,800
within a few days.

599
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,640
Very good.

600
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,080
Madam,

601
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,760
what should we do next?

602
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,920
Pay my soft-hearted younger brother a visit.

603
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,400
There's no need for you to visit me.

604
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,520
I am here.

605
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,440
Your Highness.

606
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,760
How dare you betray me?

607
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,160
Fine.

608
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,360
We need to meet eventually.

609
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,600
Have a seat.

610
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,440
Seems like

611
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,600
I have fallen for your trick.

612
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,040
Is Qi Yan still alive?

613
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,480
Qi Yan is dead.

614
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
So, why are you here?

615
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,480
Sister, you assisted me
to ascend the throne.

616
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,600
Of course I need to return the favor.

617
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,240
So,

618
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,880
are you here to discuss

619
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,960
your coronation with me?

620
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,200
I wish to hear your thoughts on it.

621
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,640
Are you serious?

622
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,640
Qiu Ziliang is in
an isolated meditation.

623
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,880
The Chess of Generals Camp

624
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,320
is under you and Qiu Yanzhi.

625
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,800
And the new generals

626
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,400
of Shencai Army
haven't settled down yet.

627
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,680
It's easy to bribe them.

628
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,000
As long as you work together
with Qiu Yanzhi,

629
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
you'll be able to
defeat Qiu Ziliang's forces.

630
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,720
After that, you need to marry Li Zening,

631
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,440
obtain the support of Li Deyun
and the rest,

632
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,600
and secure your position as the emperor.

633
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,680
Sister, you came up with a good plan.

634
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,520
So, Sister,

635
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,280
what do you want in return?

636
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm happy

637
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,360
that you can ascend the throne.

638
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,360
I don't need anything else in return.

639
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,440
The Paralyzing Incense?

640
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
Sister,

641
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,960
you said you wanted nothing in return.

642
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,400
Why did you drug me?

643
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,520
The incense

644
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
wasn't meant for you in the first place.

645
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,800
But it's better this way.

646
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,840
I no longer have any martial arts,

647
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,560
and you've lost your strength.

648
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
This is a fair situation.

649
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
What exactly are you trying to do?

650
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
I lost my martial arts because of you.

651
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,960
You've chased me out of Heng'an City

652
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,680
numerous times.

653
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,720
How could I treat a person like you

654
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,880
as my dear younger brother?

655
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
You were merciless to me.

656
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,160
Naturally, I will show you no mercy.

657
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,120
From now on,

658
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,040
you will be my puppet.

659
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,080
If you follow my instruction,

660
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,040
I will let you enjoy your life
after ascending the throne.

661
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,240
If you don't follow my instruction,

662
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,480
you can sit like this
for the rest of your life.

663
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,800
You're showing me that face again.

664
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,360
I hate it when
you stare at me like this!

665
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
Do you think I'm pitiful?

666
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,560
Power

667
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,520
and desire,

668
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,560
in your eyes,

669
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
are filthy and disgusting.

670
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,560
Yes.

671
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,240
You are a saint.

672
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,240
You don't care about the throne.

673
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,040
But I want you to ascend the throne.

674
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,200
Not only that,

675
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,560
I will use your hand

676
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,840
to take back the throne

677
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,080
and fulfill my late father's wish.

678
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,000
What do you plan to do?

679
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,600
I will marry you.

680
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,480
First, you will marry Li Zening.

681
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,600
After the imperial court
has settled down,

682
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,720
I will marry you.

683
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,280
After that, you will dismiss Li Zening
and make me your empress.

684
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,800
And then, I will control
the imperial court.

685
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,720
I will become the next female emperor.

686
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,720
We are siblings.

687
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,720
So what if we are siblings?

688
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,160
No one knows about this secret.

689
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,360
Even if someone does
know about this secret,

690
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,800
we can kill them.

691
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,920
By the way,

692
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,120
since Qi Yan is dead,

693
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,520
there's no point

694
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,440
in keeping this girl alive.

695
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,360
What do you plan to do?

696
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,920
This girl is hard to control.

697
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
I will kill her

698
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,560
just in case anything happens.

699
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,440
Yuan Du!

700
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,440
I was the one who taught you alchemy.

701
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,720
This level of Paralyzing Incense

702
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,720
won't be able to paralyze me.

703
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,720
Shi has surrendered to me.

704
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,360
Naturally, she will tell me

705
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,200
how you managed to capture Yu'er.

706
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,880
I'm here today

707
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,320
because I wanted

708
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,480
to give you one last chance.

709
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,840
I would've released you

710
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,400
if you regretted your actions
and changed your mind.

711
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,840
But you,

712
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,880
you actually plan to kill Yu'er.

713
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,600
You have become inhumane.

714
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,000
Winners make the rules,
and losers live by them.

715
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,600
I'm willing to admit defeat.

716
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,400
Then send me away.

717
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,200
Since you've stolen

718
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,440
the map of the Chess of Generals Camp,

719
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,840
you should know

720
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,960
that there's an underground cell.

721
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,520
Although it had collapsed before,

722
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,200
we managed to restore it.

723
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,720
Thirteen,

724
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,400
what are you going to do?

725
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
Are you going to lock me up?

726
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,280
Sister,

727
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,960
didn't you say that you weren't
willing to leave Heng'an City?

728
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,880
I will grant you your wish.

729
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,200
You can stay by my side.

730
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,720
No.

731
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,280
I'm willing to leave Heng'an City.

732
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,360
I thought you were

733
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,320
- going to send me to a distant place?
- Yuan Du.

734
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,520
I'm willing to go anywhere!

735
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm willing to go anywhere!

736
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,840
Thirteen!

737
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,000
