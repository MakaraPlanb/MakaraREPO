Must you go to Prince Guang now?

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
Don't you know how risky that is?

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,160
Forget it.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,840
Give me the map.

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,420
(Side yard, front hall, barrack,
square, firewood shed)

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,680
The dungeon

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
is under the Chess
of Generals Camp square.

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,680
There are two entrances.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
We can't use the one in the main hall.

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,720
The other is inside Yanzhi's room.

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
Come with me.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,120
All of you, come with me.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,440
The tea is brewed just right.

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Your Highness has unmatched
tea brewing skills.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
If former Chancellor Wang

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,960
could see this

30
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,920
and realize how successful
his granddaughter has become,

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,840
he would be proud of you.

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Guards.

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes.

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,160
(Chess of Generals Camp)
Bring Prince Guang here as well.

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,080
I want the former Chess Overseer and

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,240
the former Left Minister

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,640
to witness

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,320
the birth of the new
Golden Chess Pieces!

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes.

40
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
(Bagua Mechanism)

41
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,920
Prince Guang.

42
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,640
Yu'er?

43
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,200
Yu'er?

44
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Madam Jade.

45
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Why are you here?

46
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,560
Madam Jade asked me to rescue you.

47
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,440
Let's leave.

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,600
Be patient.

49
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
We haven't finished the book.

50
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,320
Yu'er.

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,040
We cannot leave.

52
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
As long as I'm here,

53
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,240
Qiu Ziliang will not
suspect any foul play.

54
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
So His Majesty

55
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
won't be in danger.

56
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,280
Madam Jade.

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,160
Let's go.

58
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,720
Madam Jade!

59
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,960
We need to go.

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,800
Go on.

61
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,080
Let's go, Madam Jade.

62
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,280
Madam Jade!

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,200
Madam Jade!

64
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
- Who are you?
- Let's go.

65
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Protect Yu'er.

66
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,790
(Chess of Generals Camp)

67
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
I remember that two years ago,

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,200
I tossed this handkerchief out.

69
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,280
Yanzhi commanded Yan Xiu

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
to deploy a six-men formation

71
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,680
and managed to fend off
all the grunts.

72
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,840
I knew from that moment

73
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,120
that she would amount to greatness.

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,360
There are plenty of soldiers around,

75
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
but capable generals are rare.

76
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,320
They are merely

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
some fighters.

78
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
Now, there are only a handful of people

79
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
who can put their minds to good use.

80
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
Sir!

81
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,760
There is an assassin!

82
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
It was Cheng Ruoyu!

83
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Take her down!

84
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,140
(Chess of Generals Camp)

85
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
Get to the secret passage.

86
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,960
Go!

87
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,440
Go!

88
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,900
(Chess of Generals Camp)

89
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,760
(Xiu.)

90
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,160
(Where are you now?)

91
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
(Why didn't you stop Ruoling?)

92
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,360
(If she gets hurt,)

93
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,440
(I'll make you pay.)

94
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
After her!

95
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,800
(Thankfully,)

96
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
(I told Ruoling the locations)

97
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,360
(of all contraptions.)

98
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
(She may not be very bright,)

99
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,200
(but she is alert in fights.)

100
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,480
(Ruoling.)

101
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
(Run for your life.)

102
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Someone's here.

103
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,320
It's all right.

104
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Don't apologize.

105
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
We didn't expect

106
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
the soldiers would come after us.

107
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
According to Yanzhi,

108
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,840
Han Yue demolished the contraptions
of this place.

109
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Since they had no time for renovation,

110
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,240
they abandoned

111
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,400
the badly damaged Eta Ursae Majoris.

112
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Eta Ursae Majoris is at...

113
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
It's inside here.

114
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
A spot inside the chamber

115
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,600
has been breached.

116
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,600
This is bad.

117
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,680
They got out!

118
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,560
Hurry up!

119
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
Stop them!

120
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,200
Do not let them

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,840
leave the camp!

122
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,480
- Yes.
- Hurry!

123
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,800
After them!

124
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,570
(Chess of Generals Camp)

125
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,960
Close in!

126
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Madam Jade!

127
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,680
Put down the Qingguang Sword.

128
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
If you refuse,

129
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,960
I'll show

130
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,360
no

131
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,040
mercy!

132
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,850
(Chess of Generals Camp)

133
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,240
Little Fish.

134
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,080
Father!

135
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
Please,

136
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
don't hurt her.

137
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,520
Why?

138
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,720
Do you think

139
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,640
I would hurt her?

140
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
Do you still need her for your bidding?

141
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,520
Am I right?

142
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Yes.

143
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
I've been using her.

144
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,400
You killed Li Rong and Cheng Xi.

145
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,640
You did so

146
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,800
because you wanted her
to have no family left in this world

147
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,560
and to devote her life to serving you.

148
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Am I right?

149
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes.

150
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,520
You even robbed her of her love.

151
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,360
You married His Majesty.

152
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,760
Am I right?

153
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Yes.

154
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,160
She has done nothing to harm you.

155
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
So why must you do this?

156
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I envy her.

157
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
I envy her gift and that

158
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
she could learn martial arts.

159
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,080
Everyone likes her.

160
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,880
Even His Majesty is in love with her.

161
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
She ruined my plan time after time.

162
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,440
My effort went down the drain
because of her.

163
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,520
I've always wanted to take her life.

164
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,960
But she is Wang Ruoling.

165
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
She is the only person

166
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,240
who knows about the late emperor's
posthumous edict.

167
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,000
So I must keep her alive.

168
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,760
I must help her regain her memory

169
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,200
so I can use her

170
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,560
to find the lost edict.

171
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,600
But why would you need the edict?

172
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,040
Because the posthumous edict states

173
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,160
that Prince Guang is the heir
of the throne.

174
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,920
So I intend to help Prince Guang
seize the throne

175
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,800
and be his Empress instead.

176
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
Well done.

177
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,880
Left Chariot.

178
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,800
Yes.

179
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,800
I leave her to you.

180
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,840
Use whatever torture

181
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,560
that pleases you.

182
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
I have enough ways

183
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,720
to take care of women.

184
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,000
Guards.

185
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Take them away!

186
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,600
What do you want with her?

187
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
She lost her memory.

188
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,600
To make a woman obey,

189
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,840
the quickest way is to

190
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,320
acquire her body

191
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
and crush her mind.

192
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
How dare you!

193
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,360
She is my woman.

194
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

195
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,040
I told you

196
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,280
not to harm her.

197
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,600
What?

198
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Do you still have any strength left?

199
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Of course.

200
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
Who's the next?

201
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,560
Do you think

202
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
you could keep her safe?

203
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,480
I can.

204
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,280
I learned the best from you,
my godfather.

205
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,720
I can't let you down.

206
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,480
You...

207
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,360
I...

208
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,360
can take my own life

209
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
and throw Heng'an into chaos.

210
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,160
Godfather.

211
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,800
Do you believe me?

212
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,120
The prefectures want a reason
to rebel against us.

213
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
Lucong rebels have been suppressed,

214
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,520
but they are capable of retaliating.

215
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
Not to mention you killed

216
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,520
the people of Zhenwu.

217
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,680
You have enemies from
all three directions.

218
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,480
Godfather.

219
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Are you not worried at all?

220
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,080
Release Yu'er.

221
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,720
You still have me and Consort Shu.

222
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,760
You may keep

223
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,680
your title as the powerful Duke Chu.

224
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Otherwise,

225
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm taking you down with me.

226
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,040
I'll let her go.

227
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,880
Impressive.

228
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
Your Majesty.

229
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,920
I am truly impressed.

230
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,960
Impressive indeed!

231
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Leave!

232
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,360

As per Duke Chu's order,

253
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,440
Your Majesty and Your Highness
must focus on recovery.

254
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
We must block any airflow

255
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880

(Distract the enemies for me.)

261
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,120
(The path is full of perils.)

262
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
(But this journey)

263
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,000
(will open your eyes to many things.)

264
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,320
(Such as?)

265
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,880
(Such as Yanzhi's)

266
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,800
(true intention.)

267
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,360
Little Fish.

268
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Father.

269
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,440
Please,

270
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,800
don't hurt her.

271
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,120
Do you still need her for your bidding?

272
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,920
Yes.

273
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
I've been using her.

274
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,200
(Qiu Ziliang wanted to alienate
Yanzhi and I)

275
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,400
(because he wanted
to make Yanzhi suffer.)

276
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
How did you get this?

277
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,400
I foresaw this situation.

278
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,640
This is one of the torture

279
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
the Left Knight came up with.

280
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,520
He locked people inside

281
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,200
a dark and small room,

282
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,480
leaving the prisoners with no sound

283
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,680
or any hope.

284
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,400
They didn't feed the prisoner.

285
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,720
They left the prisoners there
for three days.

286
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
Then, they opened the door.

287
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,480
The prisoners were alive,

288
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,960
but their minds were crumbled.

289
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,640
The Left Knight was a great talent.

290
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
He has lost the game anyway.

291
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,520
Do you know why?

292
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,520
Why?

293
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,320
Justice always prevails.

294
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,000
I can't believe you still believe that.

295
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,760
I do.

296
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,400
I've never stopped believing that.

297
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,080
Qiu Ziliang

298
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,840
wanted to alienate

299
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,480
you and Yu'er.

300
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,880
But when he saw the look
in Yu'er eyes

301
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
as she left,

302
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,920
Yu'er must have known everything.

303
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
Is that true?

304
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,000
A true heart

305
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,200
can never be concealed

306
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,600
with lies.

307
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,560
Madam Jade.

308
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
Do not blame yourself.

309
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,280
Our rescue mission

310
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,880
was reckless,

311
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
but we didn't return empty-handed.

312
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,600
Now

313
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,600
we know

314
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,560
Qiu Ziliang's plan.

315
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
But he has no idea

316
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,640
what our plan is.

317
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,440
Isn't that right?

318
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
Our top priority

319
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,240
is to rescue His Majesty.

320
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,640
Only then

321
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,360
would Prince Guang

322
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
come with us.

323
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
Then we can save Yanzhi.

324
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,640
Right?

325
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,560
They are standing down

326
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,880
so Qiu Ziliang would

327
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
let his guard down.

328
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,120
Qiu Ziliang instigated
the trouble in Shencai Army

329
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,000
so he could take down Official Li
during the chaos.

330
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,840
His Majesty wanted to use
that opportunity

331
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,200
to regain control over Shencai Army.

332
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,320
The key to our success

333
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,840
is Official Li.

334
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
(Danfeng Gate)
We want answers!

335
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,519
Yes! We want answers!

336
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,360
Return our pay and provisions!

337
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,760
Li Deyun, show yourself!

338
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,360
Return our pay and provisions!

339
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,240
We want our pay and provisions!

340
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,120
How could they cut down our pay!

341
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,720
They shouldn't!

342
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,080
Brothers!

343
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,280
Li Deyun is coming!

344
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,880
Let's go!

345
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,680
We'll make him explain everything.

346
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
Let's go.

347
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,720
Insolence!

348
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,680
How dare you

349
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,760
block the way of our Chancellor.

350
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,880
What is it

351
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,480
that you seek?

352
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,120
Why did you cut down our pay?

353
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,880
You have no right!

354
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
You have no right!

355
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,520
Why should we get paid less?

356
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
We could barely survive.

357
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,080
And then you cut the budget
for our uniforms

358
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,080
and horse feed.

359
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,160
We will not be oppressed!

360
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,960
We will not be oppressed!

361
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,800
We will not be oppressed!

362
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,680
We will not be oppressed!

363
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,720
We have rules and laws

364
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,840
to maintain order.

365
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,600
You are gathering here to slander

366
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,760
and disrespect your superior.

367
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,920
Do the rules of the Shencai Army mean

368
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,000
nothing to you?

369
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,720
Who is your leader?

370
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
I want to speak with him.

371
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
The generals are all dead.

372
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,240
No one could give us an explanation.

373
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,280
So we are fighting for it by ourselves!

374
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,240
We want answers!

375
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
We want answers!

376
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes!

377
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,360
You can either retract the order

378
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,360
or face our wrath!

379
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,480
What is this?

380
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,000
(He distracted Qiu Ziliang's men.)

381
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,080
(Well played.)

382
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
Li Deyun is gone!

383
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Brothers!

384
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,560
Fall back!

385
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,840
The rest stays here.

386
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,880
You, come with me!

387
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
- Yes!
- Pursue them!

388
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,520
It's that Little Fish again.

389
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
You shouldn't have shown her mercy

390
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,720
and let her go.

391
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,520
What now?

392
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,280
Are you blaming me for this mess?

393
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
I wouldn't dare.

394
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,600
Cheng Ruoyu has thwarted our plans

395
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
too many times.

396
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
Why don't we just finish her off?

397
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,560
There are other ways

398
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,360
to make Yanzhi suffer.

399
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,880
Yanzhi?

400
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,400
Oh, Yanzhi.

401
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,640
This is the name list

402
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
for the latest cohort
of Golden Chess Pieces.

403
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,480
Please have a look.

404
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,400
These are the soldiers

405
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,560
who maintained their composure
and stayed alert

406
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,880
(Name list of Golden Chess Pieces)
during the commotion yesterday.

407
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,240
I want them to

408
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,120
search every inch of this land

409
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,120
to find and kill

410
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,760
Li Deyun for good.

411
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,600
Then announce to the public

412
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
that the Little Fish did it.

413
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,960
Then we'll present her in shackles

414
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
to her beloved Qi Yan

415
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,400
in front of the officials.

416
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,480
I want to see

417
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,960
what this sentimental ruler

418
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
would do with her.

419
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,440
What time is it?

420
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,160
It's been 30 hours.

421
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,400
Are you sure?

422
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,480
I've been counting.

423
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,560
The selection for Golden Chess Pieces
should be over by now.

424
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,720
The men we sent

425
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,040
should make it to the list.

426
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,240
But there are complex procedures
to go through with the Shencai Army.

427
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,000
It concerned the interests
of many parties.

428
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
We must wait for a while.

429
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,639
Zhang Zhongru's local militia

430
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
should be ready to strike.

431
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,320
What is our next move?

432
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,520
We wait.

433
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,960
For what?

434
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,080
Your Majesty!

435
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,280
Bad news!

436
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,920
Bad news, Your Majesty!

437
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,760
It's Huaizhi.

438
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
The soldiers of the Shencai Army

439
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,679
stirred up troubles
in front of the Danfeng Gate.

440
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,960
Yu'er showed up

441
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,199
and snatched Official Li!

442
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,560
Get Cheng Huaizhi out of here!

443
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,560
Your Majesty!

444
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,080
Your Majesty!

445
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,880
There's no time to waste.

446
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,400
(Left Advisor)

447
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
(Left Advisor)

448
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,870
(Left Advisor)

449
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
You must be the new Left Advisor.

450
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
Interesting.

451
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,600
We met yesterday.

452
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,320
Hand over Li Deyun!

453
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,720
Li Deyun?

454
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,200
Who is that?

455
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,200
Is it her?

456
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,760
(Danfeng Gate)
Return our pay and provisions!

457
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,400
Return our pay and provisions!

458
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,080
Return our pay and provisions!

459
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Return our pay and provisions!

460
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
Return our pay and provisions!

461
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,080
Return our pay and provisions!

462
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,080
Return our pay and provisions!

463
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,640
Brothers!

464
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
Official Li is back.

465
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
He's back again.

466
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,040
Er Niu,

467
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,880
what do we do now?

468
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,760
Er Niu!

469
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,800
- Where is he?
- Soldiers.

470
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,080
He and the other men

471
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,080
went after the girl.

472
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,320
Soldiers.

473
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,560
I am Li Deyun.

474
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
If you have any questions,

475
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
please present them.

476
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,560
Today,

477
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
I will give you an explanation.

478
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,520
Where is Li Deyun?

479
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Have a guess.

480
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,920
What are you waiting for?

481
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,080
Ask for your pay!

482
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,280
Start asking for your pay now!

483
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,120
That's right.

484
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,880
We want our money!

485
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,040
Pay us!

486
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,480
Pay us!

487
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Guards!

488
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Take him down!

489
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,960
Yes!

490
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,800
What do you want?

491
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,840
Let go of me!

492
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,120
I work for Eunuch Qiu!

493
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,000
What are you waiting for?

494
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,280
Seize Li Deyun!

495
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,320
Protect Official Li!

496
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,420
(Danfeng Gate)

497
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
(The Golden Chess Pieces
couldn't be this feeble.)

498
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Do not pursue them.

499
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,920
Let's go,

500
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
to the Danfeng Gate.

501
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,320
(Danfeng Gate)

502
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,200
Hail Your Majesty!

503
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,160
I, Li Deyun,

504
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,480
am at Your Majesty's service.

505
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,720
Long live Your Majesty!

506
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,720
I ordered them to keep tabs on Qi Yan.

507
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
Where are the Golden Chess Pieces?

508
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,840
Where were the soldiers I sent?

509
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,240
Where did they go?

510
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,320
Did you just allow Qi Yan

511
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,800
and Li Deyun

512
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,600
to meet up at Danfeng Gate?

513
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,080
I had no idea.

514
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,920
No idea?

515
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,640
You are useless.

516
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,560
And you want to be
the new Chess Overseer.

517
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,000
(Danfeng Gate)

518
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,320
Information about your pay cut

519
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,880
was nothing but false rumors.

520
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,000
There was no such plan in the edict

521
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,880
that I wrote.

522
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,840
You

523
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,600
believed the false rumors

524
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,320
and stirred up troubles.

525
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,000
The Imperial Court did not pay you

526
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,040
so you could act like

527
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,200
fools in armors!

528
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,560
The edict represents my will.

529
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
Everything in the edict

530
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,960
is my intention.

531
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,360
How dare you

532
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,080
gang up on Chancellor of
the Imperial Court!

533
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,960
Who was it

534
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,600
that gave you the permission

535
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,160
and authority?

536
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,360
We apologize, Your Majesty.

537
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,160
We apologize, Your Majesty.

538
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,840
Duke Chu.

539
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,480
The trouble caused by the Shencai Army

540
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,960
was due to your negligence.

541
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,480
Do you admit your mistake?

542
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
I

543
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,840
admit my mistake.

544
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,960
From now on,

545
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,840
you will be stripped of your title
as the Cavalry General-in-Chief.

546
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,120
Reflect on your error at home.

547
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,040
Await my order.

548
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,040
Your Majesty.

549
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,600
I see.

550
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,120
All of this

551
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,400
was part of His Majesty's plan.

552
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,480
Wasn't it

553
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,480
your plan all along?

554
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,240
I merely

555
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
play along with your game.

556
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,960
Duke Chu.

557
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,960
I shall escort you to your home.

558
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,440
Who do you think you are?

559
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,160
You don't deserve the honor
of escorting me.

560
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,840
Let's go.

561
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,560
I am the Sword Bearer
of the Violet Bureau.

562
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,800
I apologize for my tardiness.

563
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,440
Long live Your Majesty.

564
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,480
Good.

565
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,240
Well done.

566
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,400
We shall see

567
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,440
how it goes.

568
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,120
Your Majesty!

569
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,520
Your Majesty!

570
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,920
Your Majesty!
