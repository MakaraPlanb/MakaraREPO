14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
What is this place?

15
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
It seems like this is

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
the old base of Chess of Generals Camp.

17
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
It's you again.

18
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,040
You still want to get away?

19
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
Dream on.

20
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Your Highness.

21
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
It's time for your medicine.

22
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
Your Highness.

23
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Drink your medicine.

24
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Scram!

25
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,160
Your Highness.

26
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
Why is His Highness here?

27
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,960
Duke Chu will be angry.

28
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,600
You...

29
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
It hurts.

30
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,960
You must drink this medicine.

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
It hurts.

32
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,200
Drink the medicine if it hurts.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
Otherwise, if Duke Chu gets angry,

34
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,240
I can't provide an explanation.

35
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
- Your Highness.
- It hurts.

36
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
Drink it.

37
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,560
Your Highness.

38
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,400
All right.

39
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,560
All right.

40
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Highness.

41
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Your Highness.

42
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
Rest well.

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160
I'll get going.

44
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,760
It hurts.

45
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,160
These traitors

46
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,400
kidnapped His Highness
and brought him here.

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
I wonder what kind of poison
they gave him.

48
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
If I leave him,

49
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
even if I ask people to come later on,

50
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm afraid that it'll be too late.

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,680
No.

52
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
I won't leave with him now.

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
However,

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
if I cause trouble again,

55
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,800
not only will His Majesty kick me out,

56
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,800
Aunt will get angry too.

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,040
No.

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
I must still take him away.

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,440
Your Highness.

60
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
Your Highness.

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,400
Your Highness.

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
Save me.

63
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,160
I'll take you out of here.

64
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Be careful.

65
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,760
Hang in there.

66
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,720
Slow down.

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
It's you indeed.

68
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
You're so bold.

69
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
How dare you kidnap

70
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,120
and lock His Highness in the old case
of Chess of Generals Camp.

71
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
The one who's really bold

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
is you.

73
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,526
I am just being chivalrous.

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Chivalrous girl, may I ask you?

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
You are trapped here.

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,480
What is your next plan?

77
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Follow me.

78
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,840
Let's go.

79
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Be careful.

80
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,440
Yanzhi.

81
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
What is this place?

82
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
How long will it take?

83
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
Keep walking along this secret passage.

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
You will be able to go out.

85
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,760
Your Highness.

86
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,640
But.

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Only one of you

88
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
can leave.

89
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Why?

90
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
If both of you leave

91
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
I fail to fulfil my duty.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,320
So

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
It's up to you.

94
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
You may take Prince An with you

95
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
and fulfil your loyalty.

96
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
But it will cause me death.

97
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,919
or you can show your gratitude to me
by saving you,

98
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
let Prince An stay.

99
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Pretend that you never came here.

100
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
Nothing happened.

101
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,760
Yanzhi.

102
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
Let His Highness go.

103
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,320
I will stay.

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,240
I don't know

105
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
why did you capture him.

106
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,120
But Prince An.

107
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,200
is really sick.

108
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,640
Can I stay?

109
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
I am begging you.

110
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Is that possible?

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Both of you may leave now.

112
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,960
But...

113
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Before I change my mind.

114
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Leave quickly.

115
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,360
How about you?

116
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
I will be fine.

117
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Thank you.

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Your Highness.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,680
Hurry up.

120
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
Foolishly loyal!

121
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,520
Every one of them

122
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
behaves the same.

123
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,160
Congratulations.

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,560
After this,

125
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
Yu'er

126
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,360
surely be very grateful to you.

127
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
What to grateful about?

128
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,880
Grateful that I send her to hell?

129
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
You are so mean.

130
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,840
But I like it.

131
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
You are too free.

132
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,520
Did you find out the poison
on the needle?

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
I am here to tell you this.

134
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Although the poison on the needle

135
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,920
hasn't been found out yet.

136
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
But I've found the source of the needle.

137
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
It is the silver needle for acupuncture.

138
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
But comparing
to the ordinary acupuncture needle,

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
it is shorter by 10cm.

140
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,880
It is lighter.

141
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,400
Origninated from the palace,

142
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,280
for imperial used.

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
It was hard to make it.

144
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
So there were only ten sets being made.

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Imperial used.

146
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Let you guess.

147
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Originally belonged to whom?

148
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,680
Zheng Lu.

149
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,360
So bored.

150
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
You guessed it easily.

151
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,360
It was made

152
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
when the Late Emperor was
down with an ailment.

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
Zheng Lu especially refined
the silver needles

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
to treat the Late Emperor.

155
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
In other words.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
The assassination of His Majesty
by Cai's Wine Store.

157
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
It was same as Zheng Wu,

158
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,920
who was also a descendant of
the Zheng family.

159
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Yes.

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,440
No.

161
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
If I were the descendant
of the Zheng family,

162
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,520
I would not deliberately

163
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,680
used anything belonged to Zheng family.

164
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,600
Especially such a special silver needle.

165
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
You mean

166
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
someone intentionally set this up?

167
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,600
Then someone might have

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,640
pretended to be Zheng Wu as well.

169
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,040
I'll accede to your request.

170
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
No.

171
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
The one who pretended to be her

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,640
couldn't act to have such
intense hatred in the eyes.

173
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,200
Yu'er,

174
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
what's exactly going on?

175
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Aunt,

176
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I was stalked.

177
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,360
But I'm smart.

178
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,920
I stalked him

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,160
all the way to the old residence
of Wang Yang instead.

180
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,880
What?

181
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
Where did you go?

182
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,320
The old residence of Wang Yang, Aunt.

183
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,400
You've forgotten Wang Yang?

184
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,720
He's the grand chancellor
of the previous dynasty.

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
The one who rebelled with Zheng Lu

186
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
and their assets were seized
and confiscated.

187
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,120
Aunt.

188
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
What happened to you?

189
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,240
Yu'er,

190
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
continue saying.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,880
Then?

192
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Then I discovered

193
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,280
a huge square

194
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,120
and saw Prince An in the backyard.

195
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
I don't know what kind of poison

196
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
was administered to Prince An.

197
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
He's now on the verge of death.

198
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,760
By the way,

199
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,760
I even came across

200
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,800
a masked man in black.

201
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,160
So I shot him with a dart.

202
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,320
Then...

203
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,640
What happened next?

204
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Hurry up and tell us.

205
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
(Qiu Yanzhi released me.)

206
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
(I can't betray her.)

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,200
(If I let the cat out of the bag,)

208
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,200
(she'll be penalized by Qiu Ziliang.)

209
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,080
Then

210
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Prince An

211
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
beseeched me to save him.

212
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,640
So I escaped together with him.

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
You found Chess of Generals Camp?

214
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,280
Aunt,

215
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,800
you already know it in the first place?

216
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
I didn't tell you all this while

217
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
because I fear you'd
inadvertently alert the enemy.

218
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Moreover, that place
is extremely perilous.

219
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't believe you came back
safe and sound.

220
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,000
You even escaped

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
together with Prince An.

222
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,600
Would it be a trap?

223
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Aunt,

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm in the wrong.

225
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,280
I committed a huge mistake.

226
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,200
Madam,

227
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
since that's the case,

228
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,880
let's figure out the solution then.

229
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
Yes, Aunt.

230
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,960
Hurry up and save Prince An.

231
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
The one who can really

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,080
save Prince An now

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
is only him.

234
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,840
Help His Highness to go in.

235
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,640
Okay.

236
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,000
Be careful.

237
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,280
Your Highness.

238
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,880
My benefactor.

239
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,360
It's you?

240
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,840
Yu'er?

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,680
Get me the medicine box.

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,560
Aunt...

243
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,680
Both of you, as you were.

244
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,240
I've brought a huge trouble

245
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
to Your Highness

246
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
by bringing Prince An here.

247
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm in the wrong.

248
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't deserve to get up.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Prince Guang...

250
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,400
Saving my own nephew

251
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
is not a trouble at all.

252
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,800
Madam Cheng,

253
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,840
get up right away.

254
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,599
You get up, too.

255
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,000
It turns out that you're Prince Guang.

256
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
I can't believe you still remember me

257
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
when we haven't seen each other
for ages.

258
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,760
Of course.

259
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,359
I would've died

260
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,560
if it weren't for you.

261
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
And I wouldn't be able
to see Aunt anymore.

262
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,400
These are your ties with Madam Cheng.

263
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
As long as the ties aren't broken,

264
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,400
you'll still be alive.

265
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Similarly,

266
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,240
there're ties between
Prince An and I, too.

267
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,240
Sir,

268
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
this is the letter from Prince Guang.

269
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
Summon Yanzhi to come and see me.

270
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,360
Okay.

271
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
The pigeon is plump enough

272
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,880
for the cooking of soup.

273
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,840
When I handed Chess of Generals Camp
over to you,

274
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I told you about three things.

275
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,760
Do you still remember?

276
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Yes.

277
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
Firstly, to not harm Prince Fan.

278
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Secondly, to not harm our allies.

279
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,720
Thirdly, to not harm Prince Guang.

280
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
Are you feeling angry

281
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
because Prince Guang got involved
in this matter?

282
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,000
I released Cheng Ruoyu

283
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,520
because I wanted to see

284
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
how Cheng Xi would handle this matter.

285
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
If she brought him to Qi Yan,

286
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
it implied that Qi Yan

287
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,720
was disloyal to you.

288
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,360
If she hid him from us,

289
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,520
then we could get to the bottom
of the matter by following the clues.

290
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
But unexpectedly, they brought him

291
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
to Prince Guang's residence.

292
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
And Prince Guang

293
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,120
wrote a letter to me directly,

294
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,080
requesting to keep him.

295
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,680
Not harming Prince Fan is because
we fear our resources are limited.

296
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Not harming our allies is because we
fear the third party will be benefited.

297
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,040
But I don't understand

298
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,480
why it is that
we can't harm Prince Guang.

299
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,720
You really don't know

300
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
why I spare his life?

301
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm slow-witted.

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,520
"I heard recently that

303
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,320
there's a boulder in Taiwu Mountain.

304
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,840
It weighs around ten thousand catties.

305
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
It has a dragon-like pattern.

306
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,200
Such an auspicious sign from the sky

307
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,560
implies that Your Majesty is wise."

308
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
"It gave me a shock

309
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,760
hearing that the military commissioner
in Lucong has passed away."

310
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,280
When was it?

311
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
The 21st of last month.

312
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Draft a decree.

313
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
Order Shi Yu to send someone

314
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
to Lucong to pay respects.

315
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
Send my regards to Madam Ninghe.

316
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,040
If she requests anything,

317
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,360
I'll agree.

318
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes.

319
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,240
Your Majesty.

320
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,560
In the report, His Highness
Prince Guang said

321
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
that His Highness Prince An is poisoned
by a strange poison

322
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
and sent to him for treatment.

323
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,960
Is that so?

324
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,800
Then I must go and visit him.

325
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
The late emperor and I knew each other
before we occupied important positions.

326
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,720
When I was still washing dogs
and feeding eagles in Hall Five

327
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,600
and living miserably,

328
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,560
the late emperor who was just
a royal son back then

329
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,280
recognized my talent

330
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,920
and made me his personal guard.

331
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,280
Later on,

332
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
to deal with the eunuch Wang Shouchen,

333
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,840
I spared no effort in my duty

334
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,000
and fulfilled the late emperor's wishes.

335
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
However,

336
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,720
my great achievements
made him feel uneasy.

337
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
My great achievements made him insecure.

338
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,720
The late emperor became more
and more ambitious.

339
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
He treated me

340
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,160
with more and more neglect.

341
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,920
In the end, he even

342
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,200
wanted to use the Morning Dew Rebellion
to kill me.

343
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
But the late emperor

344
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
belittled me too much.

345
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,680
Am I right?

346
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,640
When he saw that his plan
had been exposed,

347
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,760
he immediately wrote
a secret imperial edict,

348
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,960
passed the throne to Prince Guang,

349
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
and commanded his confidant Han Yue
to take him out of the palace.

350
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,960
But he was wrong.

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
He was wrong.

352
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,720
How can I kill him?

353
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,280
I wanted him to live

354
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,840
and experience

355
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,280
the consequences of his disobedience.

356
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
That was

357
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,160
the late emperor survived

358
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,360
until the beginning of this year.

359
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,800
Yes.

360
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,880
Later on, I ordered him to change
his posthumous edict

361
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,760
and pass the throne to Qi Yan.

362
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
He became anxious,

363
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
and he committed suicide.

364
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,560
He couldn't endure it.

365
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
Where is the posthumous edict

366
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,240
passing the throne to Prince Guang then?

367
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
Who knows?

368
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,760
It's precisely because we can't

369
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
openly find the posthumous edict

370
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
that I established
the Chess of Generals Camp.

371
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Doesn't Prince Guang deserve to die
all the more?

372
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,680
If the posthumous edict falls
into his hands...

373
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
You

374
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
are still bad with playing chess.

375
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
Regional governors,
provincial military commissioners,

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,240
and some officials

377
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,640
have been waiting for a chance
to cause trouble all these years.

378
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
Even if I control

379
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
the Central Shencai Army,

380
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,560
if they collaborate together,

381
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,680
the situation would be dismal.

382
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,480
That's why

383
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,000
we're letting Prince Guang live

384
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,280
and holding him tightly in our hands

385
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,440
to prevent them from rebelling
after finding the posthumous edict

386
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,160
in the name of restoring legitimacy.

387
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,240
And keeping Prince Guang alive

388
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
can restrain Qi Yan.

389
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
You finally get it.

390
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,600
Cheng Xi must know that.

391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,920
That was why she brought
Prince An there.

392
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,640
The long line you cast
to catch a big fish

393
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,080
was used by others instead.

394
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
I know my mistake.

395
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm willing to be punished.

396
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,320
Your Majesty.

397
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,720
Yu'er.

398
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

399
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,960
Uncle.

400
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Where's Qi Rong?

401
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,000
Your Majesty.

402
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,560
Please come inside.

403
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you for your help

404
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,760
in saving Qi Rong.

405
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,800
If Your Majesty wants to thank someone,

406
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,000
thank Cheng Ruoyu.

407
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,760
She was the one

408
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,400
who saved Qi Rong from the Chess
of Generals Camp.

409
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,360
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

410
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,200
Yu'er, kneel down.

411
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,800
Seek punishment from His Majesty.

412
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,400
Your Majesty, don't worry.

414
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,040
I've already written a letter
to Duke Chu

415
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
to inform him about the offense.

416
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,520
I don't think he'll hold
anyone accountable for this.

417
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
On the surface, he won't.

418
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,160
But in private, he does a lot of things.

419
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
Wasn't he the one

420
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,080
who injured you?

421
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
I was wrong.

422
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,920
You changed your statement quite fast.

423
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,040
It was right for me to save people,

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,080
but I didn't expect

425
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
to bring so much trouble

426
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
to Prince Guang.

427
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,040
My injury is fine now.

428
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,320
I'll pay attention to my recovery.

429
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,560
Your Majesty.

430
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
Please let them stand up.

431
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,360
Cheng Xi.

432
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
Leave with your niece.

433
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,080
Yes.

434
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,040
Yu'er.

435
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,480
Your Majesty.

436
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,840
Yu'er is a simple child.

437
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm afraid she won't understand

438
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
your kind intentions.

439
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
I don't have any kind intentions
towards her.

440
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,080
Your bite is worse than your bark.

441
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
Your Majesty obviously

442
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,720
wants her to be disassociated

443
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
with this matter as soon as possible.

444
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,080
I'm useless.

445
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,360
I couldn't protect Qi Rong well.

446
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,840
Instead, I had to rely on you.

447
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,680
Seeing you
in such a dangerous situation,

448
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
I can't help you either.

449
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
Your Majesty is making me feel ashamed.

450
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
I see you being restrained by others,

451
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,680
yet I can't do anything.

452
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
If the late emperor
is watching from above,

453
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
he'll surely blame me.

454
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
Our brother wouldn't bear to blame you.

455
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
He wanted to pass the throne

456
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,320
to you.

457
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,920
I shouldn't have said that.

458
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,680
Your Majesty.

459
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
When the late emperor
was seriously sick,

460
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,240
I've already lived in seclusion
in the mountains.

461
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,880
It's impossible for the late emperor

462
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
to pass the throne to someone
who's living in seclusion.

463
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,520
Everyone says that there's
a posthumous edict,

464
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,760
but no one has ever seen it.

465
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,880
Qiu Ziliang is very well-informed.

466
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
He wasn't able to find it either,
didn't he?

467
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
So the fact

468
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
is that there's no posthumous edict.

469
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
If you're at odds with the officials

470
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,560
because of this matter,

471
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,800
then you've really fallen
into the villain's plan.

472
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
You're right, Uncle.

473
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
I was being petty.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
You're magnanimous and open-hearted.

475
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,760
You live up to the name
Prince Guang indeed.

476
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm embarrassed.

477
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,480
Your Majesty is injured?

478
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,960
Let me check.

479
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,560
Why was it handled so hastiily?

480
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,600
It's fine.

481
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,200
It's just a minor injury.

482
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,640
It was from dart

483
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,520
around three inches.

484
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,840
There was no cutting edge,

485
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
but the thrower has great
martial arts skills

486
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
and is very strong.

487
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,120
That's why the wound looks smooth,

488
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,920
yet it's very deep.

489
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
You can tell?

490
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,600
You're incredible indeed.

491
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
A girl did it.

492
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
And I can tell

493
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,480
that you didn't want to fight with her.

494
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,560
Otherwise, based on your martial
arts skill,

495
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
you could have captured her.

496
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,400
Or maybe you were afraid of hurting her,

497
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,920
so you left in a hurry.

498
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,480
That was why the dart hurt you.

499
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,640
I was really not afraid of hurting her.

500
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,120
Back then,

501
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
I didn't dare to make a big fuss.

502
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,200
It happened when you were
saving Qi Rong?

503
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
That person

504
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,080
was Cheng Ruoyu?

505
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,600
You're prophetic indeed, Uncle.

506
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,240
While saving Qi Rong, Yu'er said

507
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
that she encountered
a martial arts expert

508
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,240
wearing black with a mask on.

509
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,000
She even threw a dart towards him.

510
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,120
I didn't expect it to be you.

511
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
Cheng Xi

512
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,800
has been managing the Purple
Clothing Bureau for so many years,

513
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
and she taught such a nuisance.

514
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
She's so disappointing.

515
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
That's not true.

516
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,200
Uncle.

517
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,840
Why are you laughing?

518
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
Yu'er has great martial arts skills.

519
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,840
Even harder to come by

520
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
is her chivalrous heart.

521
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,720
She even

522
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,600
has a lot of guts.

523
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,920
And she's not afraid to die.

524
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,440
I don't dare

525
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,240
to use someone like her.

526
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,040
But only someone like that

527
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,960
will block a sword

528
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
and die for you

529
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
at a crucial time.

530
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,680
What does it say?

531
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
Among the three women missing
from the Purple Clothing Bureau,

532
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,760
three of them

533
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,960
appeared briefly

534
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
at Cai's Wine Shop.

535
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Is the news reliable?

536
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,920
Don't forget.

537
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,000
Not only are these women smart,

538
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,360
they're beautiful.

539
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,840
And beautiful women

540
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
make quite an impression.

541
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,360
"Someone named Madam Jade

542
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,440
appeared in Cai's Wine Shop

543
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival
in the 10th year of Tai'an

544
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,040
and a local hooligan came on to her.

545
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
She wouldn't succumb to him,

546
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,960
and her throat was slit.

547
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,960
Her slot was slit?

548
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,960
Three days after the hooligan went home,

549
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,320
he accidentally fell into the water
and died."

550
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,200
That leaves quite an impression indeed.

551
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,640
What are we waiting for then?

552
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,560
Arrest her.

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Yes.

554
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,720
What... What are you doing?

555
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,120
Let go of me!

556
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,880
Mrs. Cai.

557
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,840
Yu'er.

558
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,520
What are you doing?

559
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Why are you arresting her?

560
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,320
Someone reported this wine shop

561
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,080
for not paying the liquor tax.

562
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,320
We were instructed

563
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,240
to close down the place.

564
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,199
I'm being falsely accused.

565
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,239
That's a false accusation.

566
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,360
What's the matter?

567
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,280
Little Fish, you're here too?

568
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,040
You...

569
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,760
Take her away.

570
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,920
- Let go of me!
- Come on.

571
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,560
Mrs. Cai.

572
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
Let me go!

573
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm being falsely accused!

574
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,719
Let me go!

575
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,760
Add another charge.

576
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,000
Selling fake wine.

577
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,920
I'll get going, Little Fish.

578
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,239
(I have to go back and inform Madam Li.)

579
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,040
I have urgent matters

580
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,440
to discuss with Madam Cheng
from the Purple Clothing Bureau.

581
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
Without a command token,

582
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,360
you can't go in and out of the palace.

583
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,040
Scram.

584
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,640
(You're forcing me)

585
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,440
(to sneak in.)

586
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
Yu'er has great martial arts skills.

587
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
Even harder to come by

588
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,560
is her chivalrous heart.

589
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
But only someone like that

590
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
will block a sword

591
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
and die for you

592
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
at a crucial time.

593
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,320
It's you again, Cheng Ruoyu.

594
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

595
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,600
Madam.

596
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,960
I just received a secret report.

597
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,160
Chess of Generals Camp

598
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,840
arrested Madam Cai.

599
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,960
When I sent Yu'er there that day,

600
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,280
I've already decided

601
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,120
to completely give that place up.

602
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
Didn't she say

603
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
that she cleaned up everything already?

604
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm worried about Madam Cai.

605
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,600
A foolish woman

606
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
might let it slip when she can't handle
the torture anymore.

607
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,080
What can she let slip?

608
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Back then, Madam Jade and the others

609
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,600
lived in the Wine Shop for some time.

610
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
A hooligan even came on to Madam Jade.

611
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,160
Even if that was already
eight years ago,

612
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,920
and we also killed

613
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
that hooligan,

614
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,960
what if someone

615
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,280
intentionally investigates that?

616
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,720
It's been three years
since your brother passed away.

617
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,960
Yes.

618
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,600
What if

619
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,720
she stays virtuous till the end

620
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
and follows her husband?

621
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes.

622
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,520
(She's here to see Cheng Xi.)

623
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,360
By the way,

624
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,840
is that done?

625
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,480
Not quite.

626
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,960
It will be done in three days.

627
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
One sword in eight years.

628
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,960
I wonder if it will turn out fine.

629
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,040
When can it be used?

630
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,720
900 people were repeatedly tempering it.

631
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,960
Only 300 are left.

632
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
Each of them is equivalent
to ten people.

633
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,280
That's not enough.

634
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,680
They should be

635
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,800
like Madam Gongsun back then.

636
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,280
Aunt, it's me.

637
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,480
It hurts.

638
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,080
Look at you.

639
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,280
You're so rash.

640
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,000
If you made a sound one second later,

641
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,200
you would have been dead.

642
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,680
I was anxious.

643
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,680
Mrs. Cai...

644
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,520
I know about it already.

645
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
You know already?

646
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,080
Let's figure something out then

647
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,800
to save her.

648
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,160
You said someone else was here earlier?

649
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,840
But I don't know who he is.

650
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,120
What did you hear?

651
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
What did I hear?

652
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,800
I couldn't hear clearly.

653
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,400
It's true.

654
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,760
Even if we hear you speaking,

655
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,560
we were far away.

656
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,760
So we could't hear anything at all.

657
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,360
Yu'er, think about it again.

658
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Does the one who followed you

659
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
have any special feature?

660
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,040
His smell is very unique.

661
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Could it be him?

662
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,800
Who?

663
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,840
The masked man who fought with me

664
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
in the Zheng Residence

665
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,480
and in the Chess of Generals Camp.

666
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
One sword in eight years.

667
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,680
I wonder if it will turn out fine.

668
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,280
When can it be used?

669
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,440
900 people were repeatedly tempering it.

670
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,680
Only 300 are left.

671
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,280
Each of them is equivalent
to ten people.

672
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,320
36 people.

673
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Cheng Xi.

674
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,840
You're untrustworthy indeed.

675
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
We haven't even gotten anything

676
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,840
from Madam Cai,

677
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,560
yet someone immediately came

678
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,760
to kill her.

679
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,400
Could it be Cheng Xi?

680
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,800
Let's analyze it again.

681
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
There were supposed to be 1,000 people
in the Purple Clothing Bureau.

682
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,600
In the past few years,

683
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
900 people quietly went missing.

684
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,720
Aside from Cheng Ruoyu,

685
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,320
who doesn't have a calculating nature,

686
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,360
the rest who are left are useless.

687
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,360
But there are 300 people in Yuzhen Hall.

688
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,320
Second.

689
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,720
The expenses for His Majesty's
night fox hunt is too high.

690
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,000
It's way over what's needed.

691
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,600
Supporting warriors of sacrifice
requires a lot of money.

692
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,640
Third.

693
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
someone from Yuzhen Hall

694
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,320
pretended to be a government office
worker and killed Madam Cai.

695
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,360
And her martial arts skill

696
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,200
is very similar to Cheng Ruoyu's.

697
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,960
That's why

698
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,160
the palace maids missing from
the Purple Clothing Bureau

699
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
actually went to Yuzhen Hall.

700
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,600
His Majesty kicked Cheng Ruoyu
out of the palace

701
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,360
to the wine shop

702
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,720
to let her be in the dark
instead of being out in the open.

703
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,840
And when we found out about Madam Cia,

704
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,280
Cheng Xi was afraid that the secret
will be revealed,

705
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
so she killed her.

706
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,080
Wait.

707
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,000
What are we waiting for?

708
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,560
Let's gather people

709
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
and search Yuzhen Hall.

710
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,720
Do you think we can find anything

711
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,080
by bringing people

712
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,520
to search Yuzhen Hall now?

713
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,000
If Cheng Xi can hide 300 people

714
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,560
in Heng'an City

715
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,680
right under Godfather's nose,

716
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,520
she must be prepared.

717
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,200
What are you planning to do then?

718
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,960
Do you still remember

719
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,960
who led us into discovering all of this?

720
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,120
You're referring

721
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
to the mastermind behind Zheng Wu?

722
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,840
He used Zheng Wu

723
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,880
to let us suspect
the Purple Clothing Bureau first,

724
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,280
then made an assassination attempt
against His Majesty at the Wine Shop

725
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
to get Cai's Wine Shop

726
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,480
and Yuzhen Hall involved.

727
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,360
If we make a move rashly,

728
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,120
we'll surely end up

729
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,760
letting a third party benefit

730
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
from our quarrel with them.

731
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,000
That's why

732
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,920
we must find a way

733
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,840
to lure this third party out

734
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,440
as well.

735
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,760
How?

736
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,720
He wanted to use us

737
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,080
to deal with Purple Clothing Bureau.

738
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,160
Let's go the other way.

739
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,000
We'll use the Purple Clothing Bureau

740
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,760
to lure him out.

741
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
It's time

742
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,560
for Little Fish to make a move.
