14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,360
Qiu Yanzhi,

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,360
look into my eyes.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Look at me.

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Listen closely.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
You are powerless to fight.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,440
You will not survive the fifth level
of suffocation.

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,560
If you admit your crime

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
of falsifying your identity

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
framing You Ma,

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,680
and betraying your superior,

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
I will stop tormenting you.

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,240
Tell me.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,840
Who exactly are you?

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Do you think I wouldn't

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
take your life?

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,520
Fine.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
Since you refuse to come clean,

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
you've missed your last chance.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Let go of her!

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,080
Sir.

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
Sir, please believe me.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,960
She has ill intentions.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
She wants to marry Qi Yan
to become the Empress

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,880
and seize control of the nation.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,000
So

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
She secretly

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
left the Yuzhen Hall for Qi Yan.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
Is this what you have

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
to show me?

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,040
Please, I simply need more time.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
I will get the truth out of her.

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,600
Sir.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,760
Why are you here?

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm here for the Chess Overseer.

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
She is nowhere to be found.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
Princess Ninghe is in trouble.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
What trouble?

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,840
She...

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,200
Chess Overseer.

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
Do not make me repeat myself.

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,120
Yes.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,760
Princess Ninghe

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
stayed at a relay station in Jingzhou.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,160
She was ambushed

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
and wounded.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,160
So why aren't you
searching for the assassin?

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,040
But the Chess...

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,720
Yes.

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
You heard everything.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,160
Sir.

64
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,120
Understood.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Ninghe is hurt.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,640
The situation has changed.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,280
I want Yanzhi to be in charge
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
You have two hours.

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
If you fail to bring me evidence,

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
get ready for your demise.

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,279
Yes.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,480
(Murder is never)

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
(my first option.)

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
I have a better solution.

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,560
What is it?

76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,200
When You Ma took his life,

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
my father never showed his emotions,

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,360
but he has surely suspected me.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,120
Indeed.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
Which is why

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,000
I must make use of Zuo Ma

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
to prove my innocence.

83
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,760
I must erase my father's doubt for me.

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,360
No.

85
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,520
That is too risky.

86
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Zuo Ma is more vicious than you think.

87
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,120
Desperation gives birth to resolve.

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,080
Do not come to my rescue.

89
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Do whatever you deem fit.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
But Yanzhi...

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,240
I can handle it.

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,480
Trust me.

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,240
March.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,400
We need to talk.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Did you

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,440
deliberately let me

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
have this painting?

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,280
Even if he knew
I didn't do it on purpose,

99
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,880
he would still be furious

100
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
when he sees this torn painting.

101
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
Qiu Yanzhi.

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
You won.

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
I surrender.

104
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,280
I want to live.

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,520
I beg of you.

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
Put up some good words for me.

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,200
If you save my skin this time,

108
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
from now on,

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm yours to command.

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Deal.

111
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
Use this to treat your hand.

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
I am Cheng Ruoyu, the Sword Bearer.

113
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
His Majesty ordered me

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,640
to investigate

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,280
the attempted assassination
of Princess Ninghe.

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,679
Is Princess Ninghe here?

117
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
Here.

118
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,960
How is her wound?

119
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Her heart meridian was wounded.

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,840
She will be safe for now.

121
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,400
But we can't say for sure

122
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
when she will wake up.

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
We came up with a prescription.

124
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
She should have a few doses.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
Once we're back in the Capital,

126
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,040
we'll have the imperial physician
examine her injury.

127
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,360
Thank you.

128
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,160
I was told

129
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
the Violet Bureau

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,160
is nothing but a dance parlor.

131
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,680
So...

132
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
you're actually a dancer.

133
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,200
Yes.

134
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
Why didn't His Majesty
visit us in person?

135
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
His Majesty is busy.

136
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
He has a morning court session.

137
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
He can pay a visit after

138
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I've checked on Princess Ninghe.

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
May I know who you are?

140
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Insolence!

141
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,440
This is Princess Misha

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
of the Zhenwu Army!

143
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,600
Show some manner!

144
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
So you're Princess Misha.

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
I couldn't

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
recognize you in this outfit.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Greetings, Princess.

148
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
The Violet Bureau is famous

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,160
for their Sword Dance.

150
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,240
Can you dance?

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Sure.

152
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Then show me.

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,080
Are the poems

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
all true?

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,920
Princess.

156
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,280
Now might not be the right time.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,520
The dance is meaningless

158
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
with only one dancer.

159
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,760
When you visit the palace,

160
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,480
His Majesty will welcome
with hospitality.

161
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,760
The Violet Bureau and I

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,480
shall dance for you,

163
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
Princess.

164
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,320
You're well spoken

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
as a Sword Bearer.

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,680
Are you a physician too?

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,360
No.

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,600
Why do you

169
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
want to check her wound?

170
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Had the wound torn up,

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
it would be your fault.

172
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
It was very rude of me.

173
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
As for the attack,

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,160
I need you to tell me the whole story.

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I can explain it all.

176
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
But I won't tell you.

177
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,480
Ask His Majesty to come here.

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll tell His Majesty myself.

179
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
You're finally here.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
Zuo Ma is dead?

181
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,120
No.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
He wants you dead.

183
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,680
Yet you spared his life.

184
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
I want a victory.

185
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
I don't seek death.

186
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,240
Great.

187
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,400
Congratulations.

188
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
Your tactic...

189
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,600
has reached a whole new level.

190
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,120
Father.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,960
As for Zuo Ma's allegations

192
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,160
against my identity

193
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
and conspiring with Prince Guang

194
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,360
to aid Qi Yan,

195
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
I must explain.

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,920
The usual rule.

197
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
I get 30 beatings.

198
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
You should punish me first,

199
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,400
then I'll explain.

200
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,880
Your Majesty.

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
All of you, dimiss.

202
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Yes.

203
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,600
Sit.

204
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,240
Well?

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Princess Ninghe was stabbed

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,760
at the chest.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
The physician said
her life was safe for now.

208
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
But we don't know if she will wake up.

209
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
First,

210
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,280
Princess Ninghe was attacked at night.

211
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
At that hour,

212
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
aside from Your Majesty,

213
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,280
everyone else should be asleep.

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,160
She was attacked at night,

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
she wasn't well dressed.

216
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
When the commotion settled,

217
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
she could groom herself again.

218
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,600
But she couldn't have done much,

219
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,280
right?

220
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,320
But when I saw

221
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Princess Misha,

222
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
she was wearing the Chai Tian gown

223
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
of a Daxing Princess.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,920
She dressed with perfection.

225
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
Princess Misha asked

226
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,920
why Your Majesty

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
wasn't there when I arrived.

228
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
Judging by the look,

229
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,800
she was going to meet her lover.

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,920
Come closer.

231
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,800
What is it?

232
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,800
Don't be silly.

233
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm serious, it was true.

234
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
When I was checking

235
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Princess Ninghe's wound,

236
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,680
Princess Misha stopped me.

237
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
Why would she do that?

238
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Not unless she was worried

239
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
you might notice something.

240
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,080
However,

241
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
Your Majesty,

242
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,600
I got this.

243
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,760
I got this

244
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,560
from the physician.

245
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
I think it was used to dress

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,080
Princess Ninghe's wound.

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
I also

248
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
eavesdropped on

249
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,600
their conversations.

250
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,600
However,

251
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
there wasn't any useful information.

252
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Cheng Ruoyu.

253
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
When it comes to stealth and theft,

254
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
you really are an expert.

255
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
Your Majesty,

256
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
there's another matter,

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,080
and it is the most important of all.

258
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800
Princess Misha

259
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,400
and the royal retainers of Zhenwu

260
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,400
walked at a firm and steady pace.

261
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,120
They must all be formidable warriors.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
What is your conclusion?

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
As for my conclusion,

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Qiu Yanzhi once told me

265
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,960
she watned Princess Ninghe
back in the Capital.

266
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
So the assassin

267
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,440
wasn't working for Duke Chu.

268
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,480
Qiu Yanzhi may be a villain

269
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,720
but she is no scoundrel.

270
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,680
My aunt told me

271
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,520
Wu was

272
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
under Princess Ninghe's control.

273
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920
But when I saw her earlier,

274
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
she doesn't seem like

275
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,960
the kind of person

276
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
with grand ambition.

277
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,120
She seemed to be in pain

278
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,720
and too old for her age.

279
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Your Majesty.

280
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
You are right.

281
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,560
Something is amiss.

282
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,760
Princess Ninghe

283
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,000
could have been manipulated by someone.

284
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,200
And that person used Wu,

285
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
the assassin,

286
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
and Princess Ninghe for their bidding.

287
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,680
I requested the 30 beatings

288
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,240
for three reasons.

289
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,760
Speak.

290
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
First,

291
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
I didn't forge my identity.

292
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
Zuo Ma didn't have the evidence,

293
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
so he punished me out of frustration.

294
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,400
I do not care

295
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,600
about your past.

296
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,080
I owe my life

297
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,080
to you.

298
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
I shall gladly risk my life for you.

299
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,560
Go on.

300
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,400
Secondly,

301
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
the rosa rubus

302
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
was sold to me

303
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
by Prince Guang.

304
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,880
He planned to take down You Ma.

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
I had learned about the plan,

306
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,560
but I carried it out anyway.

307
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
You Ma had served you for years.

308
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,560
Yet he died a horrible death.

309
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
It was my fault.

310
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
That was because

311
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,320
I spotted signs of a mole
inside our Camp.

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,960
Everyone I got my hands on
an important lead,

313
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,839
I lost track of the culprit.

314
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
It was the same for Zheng Wu

315
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,440
and Yuzhen Hall.

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,319
Who do you suspect?

317
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
I don't have a suspect yet.

318
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
But the third party
that works from the shadow

319
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,200
could likely be Prince Guang.

320
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,440
For the past eight years,

321
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
You Ma has failed to monitor
Prince Guang's movements.

322
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
That means

323
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
we have no idea what Prince Guang
has been doing

324
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,360
for the past eight years.

325
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,280
If you have a fallout with His Majesty,

326
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,640
he will reap the greatest benefit.

327
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
What about You Ma's involvement?

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,280
It was a move of sacrifice.

329
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
He made the sacrifice,

330
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,120
I carried out the mission.

331
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,200
It wasn't a good decision,

332
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
but the idea of it is refreshing.

333
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
I want to infiltrate the enemy's rank

334
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,360
and observe their operation.

335
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Very well.

336
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,920
What is the third reason?

337
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,960
Thirdly,

338
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,040
showing goodwill to Qi Yan

339
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
was indeed my personal agenda.

340
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Kuang Mei.

341
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,840
I need your help to get rid
of Wang Shoucheng.

342
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,440
Godfather.

343
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,160
Help me ascend to the throne.

344
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
Do you know

345
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
over the years,

346
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
countless people have knelt

347
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,720
before me

348
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,920
and begged for my help.

349
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
But so far,

350
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
I had only helped two people.

351
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,320
Do you know who they are?

352
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,640
The late Emperor

353
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,640
and His Majesty.

354
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
They have grand ambition.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,800
They want the world.

356
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,640
But your ambition is even greater.

357
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,680
You want to serve the world.

358
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,040
Not as big as yours,

359
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,400
the Second Empress.

360
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,120
I've been thinking.

361
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
You helped two men rise to power.

362
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
They sat on the throne
because of your aid.

363
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,720
But both of them

364
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,920
have betrayed you.

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Since you get to decide

366
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,560
who sits on the throne,

367
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,760
and since Qi Ang and
Qi Yan could have it,

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,040
why can't I...

369
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,800
seize the throne too?

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,160
Very well!

371
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
Chen Yintai was conspiring with Zhenwu.

372
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,360
The timing of Shi Qinzhong's
assassination

373
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,840
was around the time

374
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,080
Wu assassinated Duke Chu.

375
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
They had been brewing their plan

376
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
for a long time before acting.

377
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,560
Therefore,

378
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
Wu's attack and the assassination
at the wine store

379
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
were the prelude of a greater threat.

380
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,920
Zhenwu

381
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,320
wants Lucong and Heng'an.

382
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,000
After the mutiny of Lucong troops,

383
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
the royal retainers of Zhenwu

384
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,880
immediately escorted Princess Ninghe
back to Heng'an

385
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,160
using her safety as an excuse

386
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,080
to bypass security.

387
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,560
They have 500 men following them.

388
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,840
They are skilled warriors.

389
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,800
Their plan is to make a move

390
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,880
on my Princess Ninghe
as they enter the city

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,160
to stop her from meeting me

392
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
and give me critical information.

393
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,160
Princess Ninghe is in a coma.

394
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,160
But the retainers

395
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,280
can still escort her back to Heng'an.

396
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,960
As soon as they're here,

397
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,720
Heng'an

398
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,520
will suffer the same fate as Lucong.

399
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,840
Lucong was lost...

400
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,920
because

401
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,200
Chen Yintai was their spy.

402
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
Who is their spy in Heng'an?

403
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,760
No.

404
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Heng'an and Lucong are different.

405
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
The same tactic

406
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
will not work here.

407
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,200
Lucong fell

408
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,880
because the enemy took control
of the army.

409
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,120
As for Daxing,

410
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,360
the command of the army

411
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,600
is firmly in the hands

412
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,000
of Duke Chu.

413
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Pardon my harsh words.

414
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,400
Even if they killed Your Majesty,

415
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,480
the political situation would only
be slightly affected.

416
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,480
Not to mention

417
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
the bandages Yu'er stole

418
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,280
are completely normal.

419
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,120
Ninghe is indeed heavily wounded.

420
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,320
There is nothing wrong
with the medicine.

421
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,680
Success depends on the details.

422
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
If this was planned,

423
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
they wouldn't risk

424
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,440
compromising themselves.

425
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
I thought

426
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,720
I was smart to have considered

427
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,480
all the possible threats.

428
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
You've always thought highly

429
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,440
of your intelligence.

430
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,880
But Your Majesty believed me,

431
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,160
what about that?

432
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
I was only playing along.

433
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,440
Your Majesty.

434
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Prince Guang.

435
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,080
Your Majesty.

436
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Your Majesty, here.

437
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Military Protector Lieutenant Yan Xiu
of the Shencai Army...

438
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Yan Xiu...

439
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,120
Isn't that Qiu Yanzhi's sidekick?

440
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Isn't he the Left Advisor
of the Chess of Generals Camp?

441
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,480
Why is he holding another position?

442
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
There are two Advisors in the Camp.

443
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
They both have positions
in the Shencai Army.

444
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,520
Yan Xiu is mostly in charge

445
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,560
of Qiu Yanzhi's safety.

446
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,800
He carries out her order.

447
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
He has the assassin

448
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,640
that attacked Ninghe.

449
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,360
They've confirmed

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
it was a daughter of the Zheng clan.

451
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,000
It was Zheng Lu's doing too.

452
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,720
All 27 remnants of the Zheng clan

453
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
have been detained.

454
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,960
Their leader Zheng Tian confessed.

455
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,720
The numerous assassinations

456
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,640
were to avenge Zheng Lu,

457
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,240
there was no other motives.

458
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
For real?

459
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
The assassin left us in the dust.

460
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,720
But he got the culprit so easily.

461
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,480
At least

462
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
the fingerprints are
on the document are real.

463
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,560
Their identities are real.

464
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
I will interrogate them myself.

465
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,960
Your Majesty.

466
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Do you feel relieved now?

467
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,080
Princess Ninghe is still alive.

468
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,720
A night without moonlight.

469
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,040
It's the same

470
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,680
as eight years ago.

471
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,040
Was it...

472
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,760
the day Zheng Lu's home was raided?

473
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,120
There are secrets

474
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm willing to tell,

475
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
but no one would dare to ask.

476
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,760
So Your Majesty,

477
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
should I ask, or not?

478
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,520
What do you think?

479
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Your Majesty,

480
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,640
you want me to know you better,

481
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,840
but won't let me raise any question.

482
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Your Majesty...

483
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,600
end up as a lonely old man.

484
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Do you find it funny?

485
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,760
Zheng Lu

486
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,960
was a vicious person.

487
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,520
But compared to Li Xu,

488
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,920
Zheng Lu

489
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
did cure my brother.

490
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,320
My brother

491
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,240
requested to spare
one of Zheng Lu's children.

492
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,240
So...

493
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,240
So Your Majesty spared Wu.

494
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,720
Your Majesty told me

495
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,880
it was archery practice.

496
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
That was...

497
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,360
It was an archery practice.

498
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,920
Fine.

499
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,120
Your Majesty is right.

500
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,040
Your Majesty

501
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,720
raided his home

502
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,560
and killed his family

503
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,880
not because coercion

504
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,840
or to save your own skin,

505
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,280
but for the sake of the throne.

506
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Right?

507
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,920
Yes.

508
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,200
I did it for the throne.

509
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,240
Your Majesty,

510
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,240
don't dwell on the past.

511
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,000
When I was little,

512
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,520
I had some terrifying memories.

513
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,760
So

514
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,840
I chose

515
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,360
to take a long and sound sleep.

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,240
When I woke up,

517
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
I forgot everything.

518
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,520
You're a coward.

519
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,920
But I've been living happily

520
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,840
ever since.

521
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Your Majesty,

522
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,720
if the past

523
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
is bringing too much pain
to the present,

524
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,560
then forget it.

525
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,560
I feel tired.

526
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Your Majesty.

527
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,760
Let's make life easier.

528
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,040
Shut it.

529
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,520
The Emperor and I?

530
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,200
No way.

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,080
This is so embarrassing!

532
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Do we have the men from Zheng clan?

533
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,560
There were 27 of them.

534
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,520
Seventeen of them died.

535
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,400
Ten of them still live.

536
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Their statements match.

537
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,280
Impossible.

538
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,360
I ran out of idea

539
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,000
to deal with them.

540
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,760
So

541
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
I asked for Zuo Ma's help.

542
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,240
He could be useful for this job.

543
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

544
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,920
Any progress on the interrogation?

545
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,120
Yes.

546
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,560
This way, Your Majesty.

547
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,720
Your Majesty.

548
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,080
Your Majesty!

549
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,680
Wait here.

550
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,920
Why?

551
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Very thoughtful, Your Majesty.

552
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
Keep watch out here.

553
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,920
I appreciate the concern.

554
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm not a delicate princess.

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,160
I should go in as well.

556
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,640
Your Majesty.

557
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,280
Look at her!

558
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,080
Trust me.

559
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,400
Keep watch out here.

560
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,200
Yes.

561
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,440
You've come.

562
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,600
Zuo Ma.

563
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,240
Did you get any information?

564
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,040
Report it to His Majesty.

565
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
His name is Zheng Tian.

566
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
When the home was
raided eight years ago,

567
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,000
he risked his life

568
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,080
to help Zheng Lu's daughter escape.

569
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,560
I asked him

570
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,640
how he made it out alive.

571
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,360
He told me

572
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,960
Your Majesty

573
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,520
spared their lives.

574
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,800
Carry on.

575
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,200
After they escaped from Heng'an,

576
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,680
they went to Fengyang.

577
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,960
While Zheng Lu was

578
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
the commissioner there,

579
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
he left a trove of jewelry.

580
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
They took the jewelry

581
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
and went to Hedong.

582
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,760
You Qu was in Hedong.

583
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
Didn't he notice anything?

584
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,160
Carry on.

585
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,120
The dust slowly settled over the year,

586
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,560
Zheng Wu wanted revenge.

587
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,080
Eunuch Qiu was founding
the Chess of Generals Camp.

588
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,320
He needed talents

589
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,520
from across the land.

590
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,240
So Grand Councilor of the Left

591
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,760
hand-picked Zheng Wu.

592
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
You mean

593
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,240
Zheng Wu's documents

594
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
were all forgery.

595
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,280
Forged by the Grand Councilor
of the Left.

596
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,840
Zheng Wu was disqualified

597
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,040
during the selection.

598
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,920
So she was left to her own demise.

599
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
But for some reason,

600
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,120
officials from the Music Hall
took an interest in her

601
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,400
and recommended her to Cheng Xi.

602
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
So Cheng Xi let Zheng Wu

603
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
join the Violet Bureau.

604
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,680
Good.

605
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,200
The Violet Bureau is now caught up
in this mess.

606
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,360
From then onward,

607
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,840
Zheng Wu worked in the palace

608
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
while Zheng Tian worked
on the outside.

609
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
They worked from both sides

610
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
and used Madam Hong

611
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,440
as their messenger.

612
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,880
So

613
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,800
all the letters Madam Hong received

614
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,640
didn't come from Lucong.

615
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,120
They came from Hedong.

616
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,080
Yes.

617
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,120
But why did Zheng Wu

618
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,920
carry out the assassination

619
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,320
without enough training?

620
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Imagine this.

621
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,280
If you carried a terminal illness

622
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,240
and your days were numbered,

623
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
would you have the time

624
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
to keep waiting?

625
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,400
Terminal illness?

626
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,440
This is a piece of Zheng Wu's bone.

627
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,160
Poison.

628
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,560
We don't if it was a mutation

629
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
or poison.

630
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,440
Either the way,

631
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,080
I ordered my men to exhume

632
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,760
her body.

633
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
All her bones

634
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,320
are covered

635
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,280
in black spots.

636
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
She must have been in a lot of pain.

637
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,880
So she took a leap of faith.

638
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,000
Cheng Ruoyu doesn't need to know this.

639
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,880
Yes.

640
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
With Zheng Wu dead,

641
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,000
Zheng Tian risked his life

642
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,800
for a chance.

643
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,520
He could kill His Majesty,

644
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,400
so he targeted Ninghe instead.

645
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,320
As for those people,

646
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,080
they wanted His Majesty to
suspect Zhenwu

647
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,920
and instigate the fightings
of the two parties.

648
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
Other than that,

649
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,960
there was nothing else
they could do.

650
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,400
Does Your Majesty believe this?

651
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
The man who spared them

652
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,000
was indeed me.

653
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,400
This conspiracy concerns
His Majesty as well.

654
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,920
You Ju,

655
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
Grand Councilor of the Left,

656
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,440
Cheng Xi...

657
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Everyone's minor mistakes

658
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,880
gave birth to this predicament.

659
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,400
What do you believe?

660
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,840
I don't believe this.

661
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,200
I interrogated

662
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,240
these people personally.

663
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,560
Whether they were

664
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
telling the truth or not,

665
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,640
I can still

666
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
spot their deception.

667
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,160
They were telling the truth.

668
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
That's all they know for now.

669
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
There is

670
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,040
a mastermind

671
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,720
who's been setting
their plans into motion

672
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,400
and orchestrated this plot.

673
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,400
The mastermind is impressive.

674
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,440
I can't wait

675
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,640
to witness the next move.

676
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,120
Your Majesty!

677
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,840
Your Majesty!

678
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Cheng Ruoyu!

679
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,920
Your Majesty.

680
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,600
I didn't mean to barge in.

681
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
My aunt sent an urgent message.

682
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,520
Princess Ninghe just entered the city.

683
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,680
Is she awake?

684
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
No.

685
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,720
Princess Misha insisted

686
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,120
the imperial physicians
could give better treatments.

687
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,960
So they came here

688
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,200
without notifying us.

689
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
What should be seen

690
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,760
will be seen eventually.

691
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,160
Yes.

692
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
You've witnessed the mastermind's

693
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,080
next step of the plan.

694
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,680
What's wrong?

695
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
I'm all right.

696
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,040
It's just that...

697
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
Are you all right?

698
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,320
You should go get some rest.

699
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,280
Your Majesty.

700
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,520
I'll be fine.

701
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,600
I've been through worse situations.

702
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,320
I...

703
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,840
I might need to take a break.

704
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,560
Fine.

705
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
I'll set out now.

706
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,120
Catch up afterward.

707
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,080
Yes.

708
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,240
What should we do

709
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,200
with the ten prisoners?

710
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,120
The mastermind wishes to use us

711
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,080
to get rid of

712
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,440
the worthless pawns.

713
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
I shall go against their will.

714
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,320
Keep those men alive.

715
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,320
Yes.

716
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,320
Sun Lie.

717
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,200
Heng'an is a bustling city.

718
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,240
The place is so lively.

719
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,000
What brought the Princess here?

720
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,120
Does the Strategist know?

721
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,520
Of course.

722
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
He asked me to come here.

723
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,240
I can't wait

724
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,440
to meet His Majesty.

725
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,000
Sun Lie.

726
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,280
You've met His Majesty.

727
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,040
Well?

728
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,360
It was as the Strategist described.

729
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,480
Righteous on the outside,

730
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,440
a villain on the inside.

731
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,280
That's even better.

732
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,600
Look, Sun Lie!

733
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,520
Princess!

734
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,680
Stop!

735
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,080
Move aside!

736
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,720
Godfather.

737
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,400
Where is she now?

738
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Princess Misha's steed

739
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,200
was startled at Tonghua Gate.

740
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,600
His Majesty and Cheng Ruoyu

741
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
were hurt while rescuing her.

742
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,200
I've ordered my men

743
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,760
to send His Majesty back for treatment.

744
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,840
What?

745
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,800
Whose carriage is that?

746
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
How dare they park it at the main hall?

747
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,120
That's Duke Chu's carriage.

748
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,200
For an old eunuch,

749
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
he's very conceited.

750
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Please don't say that.

751
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,920
Duke Chu holds great power.

752
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm not afraid.

753
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,120
I came here to be the next Empress.

754
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,440
Are you Duke Chu?

755
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,080
Aren't you here to welcome me?

756
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,600
Why don't you get off the carriage?

757
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,680
Princess Misha.

758
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,440
Please show some manners.

759
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Back to my residence.

760
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,080
Don't worry.

761
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,800
She's just an ignorant brat.

762
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,800
She is not match

763
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
for Yu'er,

764
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,800
let alone you.

765
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,280
Don't be so sure about that.

766
00:41:51,563 --> 00:41:56,403
♪Life is a dream,
how long do happy times last♪

767
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:07,683
