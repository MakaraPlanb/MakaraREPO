=Episode 46=

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,320
You pulled off a switcheroo.

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,600
It was a brilliant plan.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,840
You already had a plan
to pull off at the Danfeng Gate.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,840
I merely added another precaution.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
Precisely speaking,

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,640
I didn't come up with that plan

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,120
on my own.

21
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:06,264
Brothers,

22
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:07,224
tomorrow,

23
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:08,624
we'll seek an explanation from them!

24
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:09,224
That's right!

25
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:09,904
- We'll seek an explanation!
- That's right.

26
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,224
Let's go to Danfeng Gate!

27
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,464
- We'll head to Danfeng Gate!
- That's right!

28
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:13,624
Come! Bottoms up!

29
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:15,743
Your Majesty,

30
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:17,863
can you hang in there?

31
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:23,143
I,

32
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,463
even if I were to die,

33
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,383
I would die after I reach there.

34
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,431
Very good.

35
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,791
Did we miss anything out?

36
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,151
We did.

37
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:40,951
What is it?

38
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,471
How should I get out

39
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,231
when I'm placed under house arrest?

40
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,351
You kept Gao Ping by your side
for a long time.

41
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,511
Haven't you managed to bribe him yet?

42
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,471
How did you know

43
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,071
I kept him by my side on purpose?

44
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,711
He acts so properly.

45
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,271
He knows everything he should,

46
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,951
but he doesn't know anything

47
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,991
that he's not supposed to.

48
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:22,991
Gao Ping,

49
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,591
go to my study room.

50
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,631
There's an item

51
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:26,631
within the third drawer on the left.

52
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:27,911
Go and retrieve it for me.

53
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,631
You can choose to give it to me
or keep it for yourself.

54
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,351
He has a younger sister.

55
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,351
They came from a poor family.

56
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,191
To not let him starve,

57
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,711
his sister sold herself off as a slave.

58
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,111
He has no idea of her whereabouts.

59
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:44,271
(Chai,)

60
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,391
(you're still alive?)

61
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,471
I've ordered my men

62
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,871
to send Chai to Gao Ping's house.

63
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,591
I asked him if he wanted to
stamp his name on the page of history,

64
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:00,591
or to die within the palace

65
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,031
without anyone knowing his name.

66
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,911
Seems like Eunuch Gao
chose the first option.

67
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,271
I guess Han Ding

68
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,951
had told you everything.

69
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,631
But I didn't expect you to do this.

70
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:18,151
Why did you

71
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:18,991
bring the Violet Bureau back

72
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,111
to assist me?

73
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,151
When they're fighting at
Danfeng Gate,

74
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,351
as the Chancellor, Official Li Deyun

75
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,791
will surely head to the gate
and stop them.

76
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,151
This incident

77
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,751
is related to Official Li Deyun.

78
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:32,271
Qiu Ziliang

79
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,911
wants to kill Official Li Deyun.

80
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,391
So, His Majesty must be

81
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:37,831
trying to get rid of Qiu Ziliang.

82
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,191
Cheng Ruoyu,

83
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,071
once Official Li Deyun shows himself,

84
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:42,271
Qiu Ziliang

85
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,471
will surely act.

86
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,111
If a fight breaks out between them

87
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,111
and we can't prevent
mishaps from happening,

88
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,231
Official Li's life might be in danger.

89
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,511
I have an idea.

90
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:50,751
It will protect Official Li Deyun.

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,631
Your Majesty,

92
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,951
if I didn't find Han Ding back then,

93
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,271
were you planning

94
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,951
to keep everything from me?

95
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,951
Lately,

96
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,671
I've been getting
more and more confused.

97
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:07,351
I don't understand

98
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,471
why Yanzhi saved me.

99
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,511
I don't know what secret
she's keeping from me.

100
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,791
And I don't understand why

101
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,551
Your Majesty would join hands
with Yanzhi and Prince Guang.

102
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,471
I thought Prince Guang
was the third person?

103
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,831
You still can't reveal the truth to me,

104
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:27,791
right?

105
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,511
I guess

106
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,951
this is the time to tell you everything.

107
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,431
Regarding this secret,

108
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,671
besides me,

109
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,751
no one else knows about it.

110
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,191
Wang Yang's death

111
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,071
is one step in
the Morning Dew Stratagem.

112
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:20,271
Ruoqing.

113
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:24,631
Ruoqing!

114
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,151
Ruoqing!

115
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:31,671
She's over there.

116
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,951
The Morning Dew Stratagem was
first proposed by Li Xu.

117
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,951
Using the Morning Dew as an excuse,

118
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:47,031
they plan to slay Qiu Ziliang
within a pavilion.

119
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:50,551
But the late emperor was afraid
that the plan might go awry.

120
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,631
He was afraid that Qiu Ziliang
might seek revenge.

121
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:55,951
That's why the late emperor
sacrificed his life

122
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,471
to keep the bloodline of
the Xing empire alive.

123
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:02,871
So, Your Majesty,

124
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,431
you're the bloodline of the Xing empire.

125
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,231
The late emperor ordered me

126
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,911
to endure necessary hardships
to achieve our goal

127
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,871
and ordered Wang Yang to act
after he came up with a detailed plan.

128
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,711
He was my teacher.

129
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,591
For my sake,

130
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,991
he was involved in the plan.

131
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,311
We made a promise to each other.

132
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,910
Once the plan went awry,

133
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,711
we would spread the news of
the posthumous edict

134
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,510
so that we could attract
Qiu Ziliang's attention.

135
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,431
That's why

136
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,431
Han Yue went

137
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
to Teacher's residence with
the posthumous edict.

138
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:12,991
Teacher told me

139
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,191
that if we wanted Qiu Ziliang

140
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,311
to trust me completely,

141
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,911
I had to kill him personally

142
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
in front of Qiu Ziliang.

143
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:26,871
That's why...

144
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,431
That's why Qiu Ziliang and I

145
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,791
went to hunt you guys down.

146
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:36,991
And

147
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,271
you brought special arrows with you.

148
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:43,351
Yes.

149
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,471
But I didn't expect

150
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,271
Qiu Ziliang to act before me.

151
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,391
He killed Teacher with an arrow.

152
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,231
So, that's why Your Majesty

153
00:08:58,191 --> 00:08:59,511
shot me.

154
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,471
That's how I was able to survive.

155
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,311
What about Yanzhi?

156
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,711
What's the story behind Yanzhi?

157
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:11,711
What has she got to do

158
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:12,551
with this incident?

159
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:15,471
Yanzhi was the descendant
of a loyal official

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,071
who died in the Morning Dew Rebellion.

161
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:25,631
She, I,

162
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,031
and Wu, the three of us are the same.

163
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,951
Yu'er.

164
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,911
Yanzhi...

165
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:35,911
- She...
- Your Majesty!

166
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:37,711
Your Majesty!

167
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:41,911
Your Majesty!

168
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:43,711
Something happened to Consort Shu.

169
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:47,071
Your Majesty.

170
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:18,351
Your Majesty,

171
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,871
the Shencai Army and
Chess of Generals Camp...

172
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,391
How is Yanzhi?

173
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:57,871
Her myocardium was damaged.

174
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,351
She's fine for now.

175
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,751
But her body is still weak.

176
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:06,791
Yu'er,

177
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,351
you should stay with her.

178
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,271
I need to return to where I belong

179
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,711
and finish my part of the act.

180
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:22,551
Yes, Your Highness.

181
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,631
All of you may leave.

182
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,631
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:43,591
Yanzhi,

184
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,231
I've returned.

185
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,071
Do you still remember?

186
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,111
I once told you

187
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,391
that there were many people

188
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:56,991
I trusted in the world.

189
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,111
Qiu Yanzhi,

190
00:11:59,431 --> 00:11:59,991
have you

191
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,271
never placed your trust in anyone else?

192
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,671
Even if your father is Duke Chu,

193
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:04,871
I don't think you would
place your trust in him,

194
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:05,551
am I right?

195
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,991
So what?

196
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,111
It's nothing.

197
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:13,631
I'm different from you.

198
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,191
In this world,

199
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,511
if people dare to tell me the truth,

200
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,151
I will place my trust in them.

201
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,111
I'm sure

202
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:25,311
you thought I was a fool, right?

203
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,311
But now, I wish to tell you this.

204
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,991
You're someone I trust as well.

205
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:41,711
Although I had placed my trust
in the wrong person,

206
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,351
I had placed my trust in Aunt,

207
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:46,671
and...

208
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:54,871
But this time,

209
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:57,951
I won't let anyone
influence my decision.

210
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:00,831
I know it is right for me to trust you.

211
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,551
Do you know something?

212
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,751
When I was at
the Chess of Generals Camp,

213
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,031
I saw many mechanisms within the camp.

214
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,831
But I felt that
they were familiar to me.

215
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:14,231
It's because you forced me

216
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,551
to solve every one of them

217
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,151
and you forced me
to build them together with you.

218
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,551
They saved me.

219
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,311
On that day,

220
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,351
if one of the mechanisms

221
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,751
was fake

222
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,511
or didn't exist,

223
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:35,751
I would've been dead.

224
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,351
I was so relieved when
I escaped the place.

225
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,791
Because it proved that

226
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:43,151
Qiu Ziliang

227
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,791
was trying to drive a wedge between us.

228
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:46,631
I know.

229
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,431
You didn't lie to me.

230
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:51,711
Because if you did lie to me,

231
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,791
if you wanted to use me,

232
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,871
or if you wanted to deceive me,

233
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,271
why would you

234
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:02,631
disarm yourself in front of me?

235
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,111
But I don't understand one thing.

236
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,031
Why must Qiu Ziliang

237
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:12,031
force me to hate you?

238
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:16,151
Aunt even used her death to set you up.

239
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,631
And Prince Guang and His Majesty,

240
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,111
they still won't tell me
what's going on.

241
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,111
Why are they doing so?

242
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,631
Yanzhi,

243
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,351
please wake up,

244
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:31,831
okay?

245
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,351
Wake up and teach me, just like
how you did in the past.

246
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,191
Yanzhi.

247
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,551
Yanzhi.

248
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:58,551
You're awake?

249
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:13,951
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,751
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:35,591
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:39,271
Enough.

253
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:40,551
Let's stop crying.

254
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:42,151
We still need to join hands

255
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,391
to defeat the eunuch's faction.

256
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:44,431
Look.

257
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,111
I'm doing fine, right?

258
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,071
Both of us are doing fine.

259
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,351
Let's stop crying.

260
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:52,591
- Let's stop crying.
- No.

261
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:56,271
Ruoling,

262
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:58,271
you must leave.

263
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:00,911
This is too dangerous.

264
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,311
Heng'an is too dangerous.

265
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,231
All the more I need to stay here.

266
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,470
Listen to me.

267
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,950
Go and find Yan Xiu.

268
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:11,791
Yan Xiu promised me

269
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,031
that he would protect you with his life.

270
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:15,551
Go and find him.

271
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,351
Both of you should leave
Heng'an immediately.

272
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,470
You're hiding something from me,
am I right?

273
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,631
What is

274
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,511
the special reason behind all of this?

275
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,471
What is the reason

276
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:26,871
you're risking your life

277
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,791
to protect, save, and assist me?

278
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,071
You know how stubborn I am

279
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:36,831
when I try

280
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:37,751
to seek answers.

281
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,311
If you don't tell me the truth,

282
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,991
I will continue investigating,

283
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,871
until I find out the truth.

284
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:49,511
Yanzhi.

285
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:53,511
Fine.

286
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:56,471
I'll tell you.

287
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,511
But this isn't the time.

288
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:02,591
Tomorrow.

289
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:08,071
If both of us are still alive
by tomorrow,

290
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,631
I'll tell you everything.

291
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,871
Why must we wait until tomorrow?

292
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,911
Because someone is going

293
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,911
to reach Heng'an by tomorrow.

294
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,031
Nine.

295
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,351
Nine.

296
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:42,631
Nine.

297
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,631
Nine, wake up.

298
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,951
Nine.

299
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,671
Wake up.

300
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,271
Nine.

301
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,031
Wake up.

302
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,591
Wake up.

303
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,191
Nine.

304
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,591
What's wrong?

305
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,471
Even you...

306
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,991
Even a bird is leaving me.

307
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:45,071
Was it because
I lost my military authority?

308
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,911
You're betraying me as well?

309
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:54,991
Have all of you betrayed me?

310
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,071
Fine.

311
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:01,671
Fine.

312
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,631
Fine.

313
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,031
Qi Yan.

314
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,871
Qi Yan.

315
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:21,391
Good.

316
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,031
Very good.

317
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:35,111
Left Chariot.

318
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:36,231
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:37,751
You,

320
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,511
go and kill Zhang Zhongru

321
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:41,391
and

322
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,991
the other old fools.

323
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,311
Bring their heads to me.

324
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,791
Then you'll become the Chess Overseer!

325
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:09,871
Your Majesty,

326
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:11,311
it's getting cold outside.

327
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:12,831
You should return to your room and rest.

328
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,551
Many years ago,

329
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,191
during the night before
the Morning Dew Rebellion,

330
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,351
it was raining cats and dogs outside.

331
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:34,391
My brother

332
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,271
watched the rain by himself

333
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,511
at this very same spot.

334
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,111
I was looking at him from a distance.

335
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,791
I didn't dare to approach him,

336
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:49,151
and I couldn't approach him.

337
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,071
Back then, I was wondering

338
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:57,071
what my brother was thinking about.

339
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:02,551
I guess the late emperor

340
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:08,071
was thinking of the same thing
as you, Your Majesty.

341
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,151
But to me,

342
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,511
I am much luckier than my brother.

343
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:21,431
Zheng Lu and Li Xu,

344
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,511
both of them are mediocre officials.

345
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,631
But I have

Official Qiu,

480
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,111
I remember

481
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,711
that I've issued an edict

482
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,631
for you to stay at home
and reflect upon your actions.

483
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:34,030
Your Majesty,
you did issue that edict before.

484
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,471
But last night,

485
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,311
I heard that many generals were slain

486
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,471
within Heng'an City.

487
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:47,831
Your Majesty, I was
worried for your safety.

488
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,990
That's why I'm here to protect you.

489
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:10,751
There is chaos within Heng'an City.

490
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,351
General Zhang

491
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:15,551
ended up dead.

493
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,271

497
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:42,791

499
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:44,831

500
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:51,471
Do you think you have the right
to touch his head?

00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:05,791

have arrived!

510

I'm here to offer our tributes.

511

512
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,471
With that seal, you have 80,000

513

Yes.

517
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,671
Duke Chu,

518
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:56,951
I'm sure you didn't expect this.

519
00:36:58,151 --> 00:36:59,351
I'm still alive.

520
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,271
You've imprisoned me

521
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,671
and hunted me down numerous times.

522
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:06,711
His Majesty found a replacement

523
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,351
who looked just like me

524
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:10,151
to die on behalf of me.

525
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:11,911
That's how I was able to escape

526
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,151
and return to my state.

527
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:20,791
My face

528
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:23,911
was disfigured because of your lackey,

531
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,551
Today, I'm here

532
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:32,751
to seek an explanation from you.

533
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:44,791
All thanks to Duke Chu,

534
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:46,951
the people of Zhenwu

535
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,471
are loyal to me.

536
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:51,831
The Zhenwu Army isn't in Heng'an.

537
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:53,991
What can you do to me?

538
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:58,791
How do you know the Zhenwu Army
isn't in Heng'an?

539
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,111
Since I'm here,

540
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:07,711
naturally,

541
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,151
my army is here as well.

542
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,031
Duke Chu, if you don't believe me,

543
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:14,511
you may take a look outside.

544
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:20,071
Duke Chu,

545
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:24,351
besides killing people
without any restraint,

546
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:26,911
you haven't noticed

547
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,311
the situation outside the gate, am I right?

548
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:32,351

What's the point of
keeping you guys alive?

00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,751
Such audacity.

553
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,031
How dare you be rampant

554
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,751
within the imperial court?

555
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:47,151
Rampant?

556
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:58,711
I've always been like this.

557
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,071
Your Majesty, don't tell me
you don't know about that?

558
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,791
If I can kill General Zhang,

559
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,471
General Ma, and General Wang,

560
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:14,191
that means I can kill you at any time.

561
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:16,471
Official Qiu,

562
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:18,111
are you sure

563
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:20,551
you killed the real General Zhang?

564
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,271
Maybe there's something wrong with
Left Chariot's eyes.

565
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,311
What if he killed
the wrong person again?

566
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:32,671
Someone!

567
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:34,951
Where are the generals
of the Shencai Army?

568
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:07,471
Let go of me!

569
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:08,271
Hurry up!

570
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:10,231
Go!

571
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:12,151
Don't try anything funny! Hurry!

572
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:12,911
Go!

573
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,231
- Don't try anything funny!
- Kneel!

574
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,870
(Brave and Heroic)

575
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:28,911
Under His Majesty's order,

576
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,311
we are to eradicate the rebels
within Shencai Army.

577
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:32,911
Those who resist

578
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:35,031
will be executed!

579
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:18,991
Qi Yan,

580
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:21,591
good job.

581
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,391
Do you think

582
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,031
you can win against me?

583
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:29,351
I told you before.

584
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,151
I will surely win.

585
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:35,911
You're wrong.

586
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,271
As long as I'm around,

587
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:42,031
you'll never be able to win against me.

588
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,471
Do you think you can win

589
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,791
with Little Fish?

590
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,511
Do you think you can win

591
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,671
with these useless fools

592
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,151
within and outside the imperial court?

593
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,751
You won't be able to touch me.

594
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:26,831
Try me if you dare.

595
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,431
Princess Misha,

596
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,071
you're a tough girl indeed.

597
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:58,431
You've been dead time and time again.

598
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,151
Yet, somehow, you're still alive.

599
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,751
You're a great girl.

600
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:05,911
Seems like

601
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:10,231
you'll be the empress.

602
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,800
(Hanyuan Hall)

603
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:27,231
Stop right there!

604
00:43:28,511 --> 00:43:29,151
Kill him!

605
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:31,151
Stop running!

606
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:32,151
After him!

607
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:33,711
Stop right there!

608
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:36,111
Capture him!

609
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:37,551
Stop running!

610
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:52,631
Kill them!

611
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,311
Kill them!

612
00:43:56,391 --> 00:44:00,071
Kill them!

613
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:17,970
(Hanyuan Hall)

614
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:23,111
Close the palace gate!

615
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,200
(Danfeng Gate)

616
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:30,111
Kill all of them!
