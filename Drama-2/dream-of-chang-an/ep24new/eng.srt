=Episode 24=

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
What brought you here?

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
I was summoned

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
to play some tunes
for the Grand Empress Dowager.

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
Her room is in the other direction.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
You are at the wrong place.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
I have questions for Your Majesty.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
Has Your Majesty considered

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
what I proposed the other day?

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
Lady Li,

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
how generous of you.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
I was moved by your action.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,280
However,

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,160
that was uncalled for.

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,280
Have you found

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
a better partner?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Is that why you rejected me?

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
I don't understand what you mean.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,480
It's Cheng Ruoyu,

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
am I right?

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
You think she is more loyal,

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,160
reliable,

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
and more useful.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
Isn't that why you rejected me

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,560
without hesitation?

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
Not everyone shares
your view of the world.

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I don't judge a person

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
based on their usefulness to me.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
Your Majesty, you are wrong.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Cheng Ruoyu was merely part of a scheme.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
She always is.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,520
Her seemingly innocent look

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,560
has deceived you.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Silence.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
This ends here.

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
We may still be friends.

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
Haven't you noticed?

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Ever since she came into your life,

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
nothing you do has ever

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
come to fruition.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you really think she and her aunt

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
are loyal to you?

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you have any idea

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,560
how Prince An came back?

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
It was Cheng Xi.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,640
Cheng Xi sold you out!

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
We found out

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Qiu Ziliang was hiding Prince An

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
in the residence

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
of Changle Parlor
at the east of Heng'an.

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,920
A neighbor confirmed

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
the person who sent him there

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
was Cheng Xi.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,280
You could confront her about this.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
If she could betray you,

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
do you think her niece would be loyal?

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
About Cheng Xi's background,

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
where should we start?

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
Perhaps

73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
I could ask around

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,520
in her hometown Puzhou.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,320
If she was willing to tell Cheng Ruoyu,

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
that would mean she left nothing

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
that could be traced back to her.

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,760
Rather than searching
at the wrong place,

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,720
we might as well use the shortcut.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,600
A shortcut?

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
We could just ask the Right Minister.

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,800
(If you don't believe me,)

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,680
(you could confront Cheng Ruoyu.)

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
(See as she denies everything)

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
(and uses her fancy words)

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
(to keep you fooled.)

87
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
(Yu'er will never lie to me.)

88
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,560
How did Prince An get back?

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
What have you found?

90
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
(If His Majesty knew)

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
(my aunt handed Prince An)

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,040
(over to Qiu Ziliang,)

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
(what would he think of me?)

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,280
(Tell me, Yu'er.)

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
(You haven't changed.)

96
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
(It was only Cheng Xi's doing.)

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
(My aunt made a grave mistake.)

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
(I shouldn't lie for her.)

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,800
(However...)

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
(Even if Cheng Xi betrayed me,)

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
(I would never be mad at you.)

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,680
(However,)

103
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
(if I could stop her in time)

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
(and make her give up her plot,)

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,320
(there might still be a chance.)

106
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,880
(I only ask that)

107
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,120
(you can be honest with me.)

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,920
Prince An knew nothing.

109
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,360
Is that so?

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
You told me

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
you need confirmation regarding
an investigation.

112
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
What have you found?

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
I went to Yanzhi.

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,840
I asked her to help me locate

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Princess Misha.

116
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
And?

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
She had no idea either.

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,520
So,

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
is there nothing

120
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,520
you wish to tell me?

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,840
I...

122
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,080
(Yu'er,)

123
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
(be honest with me.)

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
(Tell me the truth,)

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,880
(I will forgive you.)

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
However,

128
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
I can't tell you just yet.

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,320
Why?

130
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
That's because...

131
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,080
In any case,

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
I must get to the bottom of it.

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
Dismissed.

134
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,280
I...

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
want some time alone.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Yes.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
I take my leave now.

138
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Right Minister.

139
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
I have three questions.

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
What is the cost for that?

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,760
Very well.

142
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll go first.

143
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,320
My first questions is,

144
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
is Cheng Xi

145
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
really your half-sister

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
from a different father?

147
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,160
Cheng Ruoyu

148
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
asked me to investigate your background.

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,160
But you once warned me

150
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
not to pursue the lead.

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought

152
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
we had come to an agreement.

153
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,960
But now,

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
Cheng Xi surprised us all.

155
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,000
To save my own neck,

156
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,880
perhaps I could only...

157
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,880
The Crown Prince?

158
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Do you mean...

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
The family's wealth

160
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,920
goes to the younger brother
when the son is gone.

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
But as long as the son lives,

162
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,360
the brother gets nothing.

163
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,160
You plan to replace the brother

164
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
with a Crown Prince.

165
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Qiu Ziliang will never

166
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
allow this.

167
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Uncle.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,160
Has His Majesty finished his meal?

169
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
He didn't touch the food.

170
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm worried sick.

171
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,520
Yu'er.

172
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
I must ask you,

173
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
and you must be honest with me.

174
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
Did you do something that
upset His Majesty again?

175
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
- I...
- You know,

176
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
the way

177
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
His Majesty looked at me lately...

178
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
What do you mean?

179
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,400
He considers me an eyesore.

180
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll ask him.

181
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,560
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
His Majesty and Official Li

183
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
are discussing the matter

184
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,080
of appointing a Crown Brother.

185
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
We were ordered

186
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,560
not to interrupt the discussion.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,680
Do as I say.

188
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
Anyway,

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,560
just keep my advice in mind.

190
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
While you're at work,

191
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
be more sensible.

192
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,960
Don't upset His Majesty even more.

193
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Yes.

194
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,960
Official Li.

195
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
Official Li.

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,000
Huaizhi.

197
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm here.

198
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,360
Close the door.

199
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes.

200
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
My second question,

201
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
are you willing to help me

202
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,640
resolve the situation?

203
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
Very well.

204
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
Before we can save Qi Yan,

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
we shall join hands.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Now,

207
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
I have one final question.

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,640
The true origin of Cheng Ruoyu.

209
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,040
Or maybe

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
the truth about yours and
Cheng Xi's background.

211
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,960
You refuse to tell me.

212
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Do I need to pay extra?

213
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Or do you not trust me?

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
I thought you knew.

215
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Indeed.

216
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
I am Wang Ruoqing.

217
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,720
What about now?

218
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Do I have enough leverage?

219
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
Do I

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
have your trust?

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
It was in my sister's shoe.

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
I was running for my life.

223
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,960
I didn't look for it.

224
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,240
But now,

225
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
I have no idea where it is.

226
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,480
If you don't believe me,

227
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,040
then forget it.

228
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Your Majesty.

229
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
It's time for your meal.

230
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,280
Leave.

231
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,640
You haven't eaten anything in a day.

232
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,520
I won't say this again.

233
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Leave.

234
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
I need to have a word with you.

235
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
I don't want to hear it.

236
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,600
I don't want to see you.

237
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,280
Leave!

238
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I fell for your trick.

239
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
I don't understand.

240
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
I fell for your Beauty Trap.

241
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,680
Your Majesty.

242
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Naive and frank.

243
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Pure and innocent.

244
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,400
Bravery and loyalty.

245
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
You play hard to get.

246
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,360
They knew and sent me the woman

247
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
I'd like.

248
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,480
No, Your Majesty.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,920
What happened to Prince An

250
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,720
was unexpected.

251
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,160
We have a solution.

252
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
- We could save him...
- Cheng Ruoyu!

253
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Enough!

254
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
Your consolation and concern,

255
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,560
your motivating

256
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,520
and hopeful lies

257
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
won't work on me anymore.

258
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Lies?

259
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,040
What else could they be?

260
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,280
Before

261
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,760
I become furious over your lies,

262
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,359
leave!

263
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm not going anywhere.

264
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,240
When I was there for Prince An,

265
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
he said...

266
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
Prince An said

267
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,600
it was my aunt

268
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
who had brought him to Qiu Ziliang.

269
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,640
However,

270
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
my aunt had her reason to do so.

271
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,560
She...

272
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,360
What?

273
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,160
Before you come clean,

274
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,600
your lies are worthless!

275
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,520
I have known

276
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
the truth.

277
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,640
Nothing you say can convince me.

278
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,640
I was trying very hard

279
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,480
to restrain myself,

280
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
but this time

281
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
I shall spare you

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
the last bit of mercy I have.

283
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Leave!

284
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't want to see you again.

285
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,600
Huaizhi!

286
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,960
Come over here.

288
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,880
I...

289
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,800
Take your niece and leave.

290
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,400
You too.

291
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,880
From now on,

292
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
don't ever show up in front of me.

293
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,360
- Your Majesty.
- Yes.

294
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
He knows.

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes.

296
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,800
Why?

297
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,360
Why?

298
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
Why did His Majesty

299
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
chase me out?

300
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,840
He knows.

301
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,440
What does he know?

302
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,840
What does he know?

303
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
My aunt

304
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
betrayed him.

305
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes.

306
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
I handed over Prince An

307
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
to Qiu Ziliang.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,600
I betrayed you.

309
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,160
Don't you know why I did it?

310
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
If you could make up your mind

311
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,840
to realize your goal,

312
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
I would do anything.

313
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
It's now or never.

314
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't hesitate.

315
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
While Qi Yan and Qiu Ziliang are

316
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,200
still fighting,

317
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,320
we must set our plan into motion.

318
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
I have Liu Misha as my hostage!

319
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,920
What we are about

320
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,880
to do,

321
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
is to form an alliance with Zhenwu

322
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
through Liu Misha.

323
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
During the appointment ceremony,

324
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
we'll launch the mutiny.

325
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,320
The empire of Qi family

326
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,240
will become ours.

327
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,320
Leave!

328
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,360
If you plea for Li Deyun again,

329
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,840
I'll punish you as well!

330
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,200
From now on,

331
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
unless summoned by me,

332
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,000
Prince Yi is not allowed
to enter the palace!

333
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm sorry for the long wait.

334
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
That is a nice horse.

335
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm glad Your Highness likes it.

336
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,440
I

337
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,240
managed to hunt down a white eagle.

338
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,160
Its feathers make fine arrows.

339
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
My father and I

340
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,080
are leaving for Yuanzhou.

341
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,560
But

342
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,960
we are supposed to get married

343
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
in three months.

344
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,520
You can stop lying to yourself now.

345
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,680
You're well aware of the situation
in Heng'an.

346
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,480
I can wait for another three years.

347
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,440
How does that sound?

348
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
You lack the necessary strength.

349
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,880
At this rate,

350
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,280
as long as

351
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,600
Qiu Ziliang

352
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,680
has control over the Imperial Court,

353
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
my father may never regain his rank
for another 30 years to come.

354
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

355
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,280
I've let you down.

356
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
All of them

357
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
turned their backs on me.

358
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm in the middle of
a political struggle.

359
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
Yet, I am blaming others
for my mistakes.

360
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
How foolish of me.

361
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,960
I am foolish.

362
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,680
I can see why all of you left.

363
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,040
News from the palace.

364
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,800
Qi Yan has banished both Cheng Ruoyu

365
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,520
and Cheng Huaizhi.

366
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
I have the honor of playing another tune

367
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
for the Grand Empress Dowager.

368
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,280
You are at the wrong place again.

369
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,760
I must ask,

370
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,960
has Your Majesty considered

371
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,920
my proposal from the other day?

372
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,000
I thought

373
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,040
you were loyal to a fault.

374
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,920
Why are you here?

375
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,120
I could ask you the same!

376
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,360
Brother.

377
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,440
Kneel!

378
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Kneel!

379
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,600
Look at you!

380
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,200
What have you done?

381
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,440
Did His Majesty mistreated you

382
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,160
in any way?

383
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,640
It's bad enough that you are an ingrate,

384
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,320
and you joined hands...

385
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
You joined hands with him

386
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,640
to go against His Majesty.

387
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Cheng Xi.

388
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,600
Do you have no conscience at all?

389
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,280
Brother.

390
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,920
Calm down.

391
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Now you want me to calm down.

392
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
How can I be calm?

393
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,200
Cheng Xi.

394
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,560
You forfeited your easy life

395
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,920
for a mindless rebellion!

396
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,800
Don't you know?

397
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,680
Backstabbers always fail!

398
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Brother.

399
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,200
Could we talk about this upstairs?

400
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Upstairs?

401
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,720
Why bother going upstairs?

402
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,720
So you do realize

403
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,520
how despicable your action was!

404
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,960
If you saw this coming,

405
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,640
why would you still do it?

406
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
I didn't ask you to stand up.

407
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,120
Kneel.

408
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,560
I didn't say you could get up.

409
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,600
I'm tired of kneeling down.

410
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
I'm tired of being obedient.

411
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,400
Li Rong.

412
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,840
Yes.

413
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,800
See my brother off.

414
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,600
Yes.

415
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,360
Where can I go now?

416
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
I have no place here!

417
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm too ashamed

418
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,520
to face His Majesty!

419
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,480
Xi.

420
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,440
What have you become?

421
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm so disappointed in you!

422
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm so disappointed in you!

423
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,240
Do you think

424
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,160
bringing my brother here

425
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,120
could save your skin?

426
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,160
I didn't bring him here.

427
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Thanks to you,

428
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
he was banished by His Majesty.

429
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
You ratted me out.

430
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,080
Thanks to you,

431
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,040
I was banished as well.

432
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,040
What is the meaning of this?

433
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,040
I am the Sword Bearer
of the Violet Bureau.

434
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,800
My sword

435
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
points only at my enemies.

436
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
By the name of the Qingguang Sword,

437
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,880
heed my command.

438
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
Heed my order!

439
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,920
Madam Jade.

440
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,960
Now you know.

441
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,560
Without me,

442
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,320
you are nothing.

443
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,840
But at least

444
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,040
I still have my humanity.

445
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm not like them.

446
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
If they followed you,

447
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,640
they would end up being used as weapons.

448
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,760
If you don't believe me,

449
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,520
then wait and see.

450
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,520
You don't belong here.

451
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,000
Leave.

452
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,560
You will betray him sooner or later.

453
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,800
Your destiny with him)

454
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,400
had been written years ago.

455
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,480
(The world is vast,)

456
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,320
(yet I belong in nowhere.)

457
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
(Where should I go?)

458
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,239
Get on the carriage.

459
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,159
I look like a failure.

460
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,960
Right?

461
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,239
You look lost.

462
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,560
You foresaw this,

463
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,120
didn't you?

464
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,679
What could I have foreseen?

465
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
That His Majesty knew Cheng Xi's doing?

466
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,160
Or the fact you were
no match for Cheng Xi?

467
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
I was at the Violet Bureau just now.

468
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,360
I summoned

469
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
all of the members.

470
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,000
I ordered them to arrest Cheng Xi.

471
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,840
Yet...

472
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
They disobeyed you.

473
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,800
What they are doing is wrong.

474
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
The pawns shouldn't care about morality.

475
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
Obedience is all that matters to them.

476
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,200
They didn't help you

477
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
because you lack authority.

478
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,960
You failed to convince them.

479
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,920
For them,

480
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
His Majesty is an outsider.

481
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,520
Cheng Xi

482
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
is the teacher

483
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
who raised and trained them.

484
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,280
It's very apparent

485
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
who's their family.

486
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,800
But what about you?

487
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,680
You didn't join your kins

488
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,680
but defend Qi Yan so blindly.

489
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Yes,

490
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
Qi Yan saved your life.

491
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,560
But Cheng Xi spent years raising you.

492
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,600
She is your true family.

493
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I think

494
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,440
a person

495
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,440
should know what's right from wrong,

496
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
regardless of kinship.

497
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
Treason

498
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,160
can never be right.

499
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,240
I want to stop my aunt
from making further mistakes.

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
I want her to stop and repent

501
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,560
before it's too late.

502
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,240
It's already too late.

503
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,240
Indeed.

504
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
I was too ignorant.

505
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,480
His Majesty knows.

506
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
My aunt

507
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
is never going to repent.

508
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
Consider yourself fortunate.

509
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,160
What?

510
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,240
You lost your parents,

511
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
your childhood was a tragedy,

512
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,680
but you have no recollection
of those memories.

513
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
You were raised in the Violet Bureau

514
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,440
under protection.

515
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,280
You know nothing of
the people's suffering.

516
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,520
That is the reason you're frustrated

517
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
over a minor setback.

518
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,440
If you were QI Yan, Cheng Xi,

519
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,360
or even me,

520
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,040
you would know

521
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,520
that there is

522
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,160
no perfect solution in this world.

523
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
You must take a path and see through it.

524
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,120
There is no right

525
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,280
or wrong.

526
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
There are only the winner

527
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,560
and the defeated.

528
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,320
With victories,

529
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,040
all you do will be right.

530
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,880
With defeats,

531
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,880
nothing you do is ever right.

532
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,080
Take Qi Yan for an example.

533
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,320
If he can't win,

534
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,720
he can't realize his vision.

535
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
Based on his current achievements,

536
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,600
he's far from being a wise ruler.

537
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,400
Your protection for him

538
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
is meaningless.

539
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,120
What is meaningful, then?

540
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,040
Winning.

541
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,120
Winning in the quickest way possible.

542
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,800
Only by winning

543
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
can you have everything.

544
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,840
How do I win?

545
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Return to his side.

546
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
Help him appease
the rebellion in Lucong.

547
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,680
He doesn't trust me anymore.

548
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,160
Do you know

549
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
who told him Cheng Xi's action?

550
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,960
It was Official Li.

551
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
It was his daughter,

552
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,640
Li Zening.

553
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,360
It's unfortunate of you

554
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
to have her as your rival.

555
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
There is no rivalry between us.

556
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
That's not how she sees it.

557
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,640
His Majesty

558
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,880
seems to think otherwise as well.

559
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
His Majesty and I do not share

560
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
such an intimate relationship.

561
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,440
Stop uttering

562
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,400
this nonsense,

563
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,320
or I'll leave.

564
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Fine.

565
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
With her as my rival,

566
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,480
I consider myself unfortunate.

567
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,000
I would rather

568
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
have you

569
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,880
by His Majesty's side and not her.

570
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
What are you trying to say?

571
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
What am I trying to say?

572
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,880
I want

573
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,120
to help you win his heart back.

574
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,040
Bring him a present.

575
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
He will surely forgive you.

576
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,640
What is it?

577
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,920
It's Liu Misha.

578
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,800
Where is she?

579
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
I told you to leave.

580
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,160
Look, Your Majesty.

581
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,760
Everyone left.

582
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,960
But I told you

583
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
never to come back again.

584
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
I never wanted to come back.

585
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,560
But there is something

586
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,360
I must inform you as soon as possible.

587
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,680
My aunt

588
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,080
only handed Prince An
over to Qiu Ziliang.

589
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,200
You finally admitted it.

590
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The secret is finally told.

591
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,040
Just Prince An alone.

592
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,880
Your Majesty.

593
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,000
What about Misha?

594
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,000
That's the point.

595
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,280
This is the problem.

596
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
My aunt never told me

597
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,400
where Misha was.

598
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,360
You came to tell me

599
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
you weren't in cahoot with Cheng Xi?

600
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Or did she abandon you

601
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
so you came back seeking refuge?

602
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,800
I mean,

603
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,560
I want to help Your Majesty

604
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,440
rescue Misha.

605
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,640
Your Majesty.

606
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,200
Many have forgotten the oath they took

607
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,000
when they joined the Violet Bureau.

608
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,000
But I still remember it.

609
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Spirits of Heaven and Earth.

610
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,520
Spirit of the swords.

611
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
My heart is my sword,

612
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,600
serving as the ward against all evil.

613
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,320
My sword is my will,

614
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,720
protecting my lord from all perils.

615
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,120
Cheng Xi assumed holding Misha hostage

616
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,080
would give her control
over the Zhenwu Army.

617
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,600
How naive of her.

618
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,840
We shall see how it unfolds.

619
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,680
Certainly not.

620
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,760
This is my game.

621
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,640
I can't let her

622
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,040
use my pawns as hers.

623
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,120
Princess Misha

624
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,200
will fall under my control.
