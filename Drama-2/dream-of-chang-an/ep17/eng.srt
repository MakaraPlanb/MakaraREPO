Yanzhi.

Hurry.

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
Just run.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Just run.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Hurry.

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,360
How could I run away

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,760
without you?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,639
I'll help you out.

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll hold him off.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
I do not know any martial arts.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,040
I have a weak heart as well.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,920
I will never be able to escape

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
without you.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,800
Xiu,

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,360
you will help me out,

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
am I right?

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll show it to you again.

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,960
There are seven underground chambers
located under

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
the square of
the Chess of Generals Camp.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,400
They're arranged according to
the position of the Big Dipper.

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
There are two exits in total.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
The exit of Alpha Ursae Majoris
is connected to the woodshed.

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,520
You can leave the camp through the exit.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,400
The exit of Eta Ursae Majoris
is located at my room.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,240
Ask Ziyuan to bring Prince Guang

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
and leave through the secret path
of Alpha Ursae Majoris.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,160
As for you,

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
you can bring Qi Yan with you
to the Eta Ursae Majoris exit.

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Remember,

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
you must avoid triggering the traps.

44
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
This is the switch

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,279
to detonating the explosives.

46
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Were you thinking of

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
using these traps against Qiu Ziliang

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,680
when you first

49
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
built these traps?

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,840
Yes.

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,120
- Let's go!
- Let's take a look.

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,480
What are you doing?

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Six,

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,920
come.

55
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,640
Eat up.

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Say that again.

57
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Yes, my lord.

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Yanzhi is Wang Yang's granddaughter.

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Her surname is Wang.

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
And her name is Ruoqing.

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
She stayed beside you

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
because she wanted to avenge her family.

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,560
Now, she has joined hands with Han Yue

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
and they've captured His Majesty.

65
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
They plan to capture you as well.

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,720
My lord,

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,280
please take a look.

68
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,680
These are the intel

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,680
that I've gathered.

70
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,200
My lord, please take a look.

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
Nine.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
You better stay obedient.

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
This is interesting.

74
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,520
Tell us!

75
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Who did you tip off just now?

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,160
Han Ding?

77
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
You were actually in hiding all along?

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Why didn't you appear earlier?

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,880
His Majesty told me

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
not to show myself before
I see the flare.

81
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,120
But, His Majesty
handed over the flare to me.

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,160
Go now!

83
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200
His Majesty is still inside
the Chess of Generals Camp.

84
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Go and save him.

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,640
You have a fever.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
It's fine. It won't kill me.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,320
Let's go.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,840
Don't be afraid.

89
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Where's Yanzhi?

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,120
My lord,

91
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,680
she's hiding under the secret chamber
below the square.

92
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Is there only one entrance
to the secret chamber?

93
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,440
My lord,

94
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,400
you're correct.

95
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
My friend, since you're here,

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,320
why don't you come down
and have a drink with me?

97
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,680
I have the Morning Dew Wine.

98
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,320
It is the best of the best.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Please.

100
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,880
Where is Yanzhi?

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,080
What?

102
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,720
Are you afraid that
the wine is poisoned?

103
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,840
It's been eight years.

104
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Qiu Ziliang,

105
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm here

106
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,080
to take your wretched life today.

107
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,640
Han Yue,

108
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Yanzhi is the reason I'm here today.

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,400
Call her out,

110
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
and I may leave you
with a complete body.

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
Fine.

112
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
You have to get through me first.

113
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
Qiu Ziliang,

114
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
you have plenty of things
waiting for you

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
down below.

116
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Follow me if you dare.

117
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,840
Hurry!

118
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Call for the Shencai Army.

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
As for the rest,

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
stay here and
wait for Official Qiu's return.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Hurry!

122
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,160
Who's there?

123
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,840
Move aside!

124
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,200
Official Yan?

125
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
Where are you going?

126
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,360
Under Eunuch Qiu's order,

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,560
we need to head to
the Chess of Generals Camp.

128
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Where's the Shencai Army?

129
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,400
My lord,

130
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I've relayed your command to them.

131
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,120
Left Knight.

132
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
Yan Xiu?

133
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,560
Seems like you've recovered.

134
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
Since he has recovered,

135
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
it's time for you to be in trouble.

136
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,840
Someone.

137
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,800
Take down both of them.

138
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,720
Go!

139
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Attack them!

140
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,840
Why are you standing there?

141
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,800
Useless fools!

142
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,280
Don't move!

143
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Great.

144
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,040
So,

145
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,480
are you guys going to betray Eunuch Qiu?

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
Just wait until Eunuch Qiu is out.

147
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,440
I gave you one last chance before this.

148
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,520
What?

149
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
You want me to be grateful to you

150
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
when you've laid down
another trap for me?

151
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,200
You wouldn't have fallen for it

152
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
if you weren't greedy
in the first place.

153
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,920
I was being greedy?

154
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,800
I was being greedy?

155
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,520
Let's go.

156
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,520
Time to execute the next step.

157
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,440
Speaking of which,

158
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
it's my first time visiting this place.

159
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,400
I need to take a good look at it.

160
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,480
Sure.

161
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,320
You can take a good look at it.

162
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,120
His Majesty has to stab himself
with a hairpin because of me.

163
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,320
That's why Han Yue was able to
get his hands on him.

164
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,920
By the way,

165
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,280
Han Yue is the military advisor
of Zhenwu.

166
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
His Majesty knew about that long ago.

167
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
His Majesty knew about that long ago?

168
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,680
Back then, His Majesty was the one
who had saved Han Yue.

169
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,760
You can finally avenge your family.

170
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
But, I don't want to kill Qi Yan.

171
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
I want him

172
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,000
to prove my grandfather's
and my family's innocence

173
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
while he's still the emperor.

174
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,360
You can do the same

175
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,120
after Prince Guang's ascension.

176
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,080
When Qi Yan does it,

177
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,200
he's admitting his mistake

178
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,160
and atoning for his sin.

179
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,800
Only then, it'll be meaningful.

180
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
Prince Guang

181
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
will never be able to achieve the same.

182
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,960
Is this why you betrayed Qiu Ziliang

183
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,680
and joined hands with Han Yue?

184
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Is your surname Wang?

185
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Are you...

186
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
Are you...

187
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,920
I will never forget

188
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,280
the arrow that you've shot.

189
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Are you the elder sister?

190
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
I couldn't find you after the incident.

191
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,200
So, you're actually still alive?

192
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,520
You were looking for me?

193
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,400
Why were you looking for me?

194
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,319
Your Highness,

195
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,280
it's been quite some time.

196
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,800
Even if we find her,

197
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,200
we won't be able to save her in time.

198
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,800
Not everyone

199
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,200
is as lucky as Zheng Wu.

200
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,640
Your Highness,

201
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
you've done your best.

202
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,000
No.

203
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,360
They...

204
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm sure they're still alive.

205
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,560
And...

206
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,160
And,

207
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
I promised Master

208
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,080
that I will protect his lineage.

209
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,240
Let's give it another try, okay?

210
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:45,960
All right.

211
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
I believe that they're still alive.

212
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,320
General Han!

213
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Your Highness,

214
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,880
General Han is still alive.

215
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,200
Back then, His Majesty and I

216
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,120
went to the mass grave.

217
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
Initially, we wanted to save

218
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,680
the two granddaughters of Wang Yang.

219
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,560
We didn't expect to
see Han Yue lying down there.

220
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
After that, His Majesty told me

221
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,640
to send him to House 16.

222
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,040
Prince Guang cured him.

223
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
After that, he sent him back to Zhenwu.

224
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,760
So,

225
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,440
regarding the royal retainers of Zhenwu

226
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,880
escorting Princess Ninghe
to the Capital,

227
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
does His Majesty know that
it has something

228
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,560
to do with Han Yue long ago?

229
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
That's right.

230
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,160
His Majesty ordered me to
do a private investigation on him.

231
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,760
But, he told me not to act.

232
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,160
Why?

233
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Han Yue treats him as his enemy,

234
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,600
but, he was the one who had saved
Han Yue in the first place.

235
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,800
Isn't that dangerous?

236
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,800
It is dangerous,

237
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
but, it is an opportunity as well.

238
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,000
What if Han Yue

239
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
was able to kill Qiu Ziliang?

240
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,680
His Majesty ordered me to
eliminate the four important pawns

241
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,800
of the Chess of Generals Camp.

242
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
His goal was

243
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
to shift Qiu Ziliang's attention

244
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,160
to Zhenwu.

245
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,480
With that opportunity, he can summon
Li Deyun to the Capital.

246
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,640
His Majesty thought of summoning

247
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
Official Li Deyun since long ago?

248
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,720
If so, why didn't he agree to it

249
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
when Prince Guang had made
the same suggestion to him?

250
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,760
So, His Majesty doesn't
trust Prince Guang.

251
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,360
It's nothing.

252
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm glad

253
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
that you're alive.

254
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,560
Have you ever regretted your actions?

255
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,360
If I have a second chance,

256
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,640
I'll do the same thing.

257
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,560
Very good.

258
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,600
General Han is right.

259
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
A person like you

260
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,560
deserves to die.

261
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,040
It was foolish of me

262
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
to think that you would
change your ways.

263
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,640
Master,

264
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
should I believe in her?

265
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,680
She's your eldest granddaughter indeed.

266
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,080
Master,

267
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
I really want

268
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
to protect your lineage.

269
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't worry.

270
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,280
His Majesty is confident in his plan.

271
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,840
Before I fell unconscious,

272
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
I heard Ziyuan said that she was going

273
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,480
to kill both His Majesty
and Qiu Ziliang.

274
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,920
His Majesty is in danger right now.

275
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,840
And Yanzhi.

276
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
Yanzhi is inside as well.

277
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
But, Official Li Deyun

278
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,880
is on his way right now.

279
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,840
His Majesty said

280
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,360
that we mustn't act

281
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
without his instructions.

282
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,720
If so,

283
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,120
how about this?

284
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,320
I'll sneak in.

285
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,800
You can wait for me outside.

286
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Do you have another flare?

287
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,400
But, you're sick.

288
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
It's precisely because I'm sick

289
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,000
that Han Yue had
let down his guard against me.

290
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,920
And I'm familiar

291
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,760
with the Chess of Generals Camp's
terrain.

292
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,720
I know that there's a secret path

293
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,600
which connects to
the underground chambers.

294
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,320
All right.

295
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,920
Be careful.

296
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
Cheng Ruoyu?

297
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
How did you return here?

298
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm here to save you.

299
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,920
But, you didn't need

300
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,800
my help at all.

301
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,720
You're actually in cahoots with Han Yue.

302
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Are you going to kill me?

303
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,720
Release His Majesty.

304
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,280
That's impossible.

305
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
I'll kill you then!

306
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Calm down.

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,400
We can talk over this.

308
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,800
We can talk over this.

309
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Kill me then.

310
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
Cheng Ruoyu,

311
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,240
you won't be able to kill anyone.

312
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,520
Qiu Yanzhi,

313
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,120
I'll say this again.

314
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,360
Release His Majesty.

315
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll say this again as well.

316
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,720
That's impossible.

317
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,840
You have no way to escape from me.

318
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Qiu Ziliang,

319
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
I've been waiting for this day

320
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
for a long time.

321
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
What other tricks do you have in store?

322
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
Reveal all of them.

323
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,120
Rosa rubus?

324
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,040
I'll see how long
you can withstand this.

325
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,000
Much longer than you think.

326
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
If you guys kill His Majesty,

327
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,560
the world will be plunged into chaos.

328
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,960
In the end, the people will be the ones
who suffer.

329
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,560
Yanzhi,

330
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,080
he's out of his mind.

331
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,600
Are you going to join him?

332
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,680
General Han will assist Prince Guang
to ascend the throne.

333
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,240
Everything is under control.

334
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
But, Prince Guang

335
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,480
isn't willing to ascend the throne.

336
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,200
He doesn't get to make the call here.

337
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,800
She has blind loyalty to the emperor.

338
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,880
She will ruin our plan

339
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
if we keep her alive.

340
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
Why don't we kill her?

341
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,360
General Han.

342
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,800
She grew up within the palace.

343
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,280
Since young, she was taught

344
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,680
how to protect the emperor.

345
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,600
She's similar to you in some ways.

346
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
Even so, we mustn't keep her alive.

347
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,720
Let's send her out of Heng'an City.

348
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,120
We should let her off the hook.

349
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,760
Back then,

350
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,040
the heavens

351
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,960
had let you off the hook as well.

352
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,800
Fine.

353
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll leave her to you.

354
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,320
I'll force Qiu Ziliang to hand over
his authority over the military.

355
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
Yanzhi,

356
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,920
please don't kill His Majesty.

357
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,840
He isn't a villain.

358
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
He did everything

359
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
because he was forced by Qiu Ziliang.

360
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,160
He had saved many people as well.

361
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,240
Some mistakes

362
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
can never be forgiven

363
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,200
once they are committed.

364
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Cheng Ruoyu,

365
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,400
you weren't there
during the Morning Dew Rebellion.

366
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
You don't understand what it feels like

367
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
when you haven't experienced that
by yourself.

368
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,840
Can you imagine how hard it is

369
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,320
for Zheng Wu

370
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
to stay within the Violet Bureau?

371
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,360
Yu'er,

372
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
I like you very much.

373
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,120
I can't bear to see you die
because of Qi Yan.

374
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
Listen to me and leave Heng'an City.

375
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,160
You should leave the Xing empire.

376
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,200
You can go anywhere else.

377
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
Never return here

378
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
for the rest of your life.

379
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,720
Yanzhi!

380
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
Please stop.

381
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,080
If you kill the current emperor

382
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,440
and replace him with another emperor,

383
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,440
you'll be the same

384
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
as Qiu Ziliang!

385
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,640
Xiu,

386
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,640
take her away.

387
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Send four troops

388
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,360
to escort her out of the pass.

389
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,120
Understood.

390
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,520
Someone.

391
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
Yanzhi,

392
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,320
just kill me then.

393
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,160
How could I be a Sword Bearer

394
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
if I have to escape
by myself like a coward?

395
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,720
Yanzhi!

396
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,200
Yanzhi!

397
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Yanzhi!

398
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,560
Qi Yan,

399
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
how are you fortunate enough

400
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
to have her as your Sword Bearer?

401
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,400
Qiu Ziliang.

402
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,600
Where's the Commander's Seal?

403
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Will I be able to live

404
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,440
once I've given you the seal?

405
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,880
No.

406
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,360
Why should I give it to you then?

407
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,480
Yes, sir.

408
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,120
How's the situation inside?

409
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,280
Yanzhi said

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,360
she's going to kill

411
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,040
both His Majesty and Qiu Ziliang.

412
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,400
Let's hurry and save them.

413
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
I'll bear all responsibilities.

414
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,200
Let's go.

415
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,800
Wait.

416
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
Look at the state you're in.

417
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
And, Qiu Ziliang and Han Yue

418
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,440
have joined hands.

419
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,960
Our powers alone won't be enough
to defeat them.

420
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,040
What should we do then?

421
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,360
Now, we can only take a leap of faith.

422
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,600
What do you mean?

423
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Qiu Ziliang was captured.

424
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
What do you think the eunuchs will do

425
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,440
when they hear of this?

426
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,160
Cheng Ruoyu, listen up.

427
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,800
It's late right now.

428
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,040
If you dare to deceive me,

429
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,840
I won't show you any mercy.

430
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Hurry!

431
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,840
Ruoqing.

432
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,200
General Han, are you okay?

433
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm fine.

434
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,680
But Qi Yan is missing.

435
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,200
If,

436
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,720
they didn't come out
before the explosion,

437
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,160
that means everything is over.

438
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,000
This is bad.

439
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
I think the eunuchs are here.

440
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,760
General Han,

441
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,400
you should retreat first.

442
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,040
No.

443
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
We must leave together.

444
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,480
They still have no idea

445
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,360
about my true identity.

446
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,960
I'll stay here

447
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,680
and observe the situation.

448
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,520
Wait for my news.

449
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,160
Just go!

450
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,200
All right.

451
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,080
Hide this.

452
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,680
Where's Grandfather?

453
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,160
- He's inside?
- His Majesty.

454
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,400
His Majesty.

455
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm talking to you!

456
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,280
I'm talking to you!

457
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,120
Commander Wang,

458
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,640
you are to respect the Chess Overseer!

459
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,640
Nonsense!

460
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,840
Listen up.

461
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,240
If anything happens to my grandfather,

462
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,120
I'll hold you guys responsible for it!

463
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,320
Go and uncover the rubble!

464
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Yes, sir!

465
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,000
Hurry!

466
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,560
Yanzhi.

467
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,520
Where's His Majesty?

468
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,520
Yanzhi!

469
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,520
- Yanzhi!
- Where's His Majesty?

470
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,200
I told you to leave,

471
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,160
yet you've returned here

472
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,040
time and time again.

473
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
I'm His Majesty's Sword Bearer.

474
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,640
I will live and die together
with His Majesty!

475
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
But you brought the Shencai Army here.

476
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,840
They're here to save Qiu Ziliang.

477
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,800
I have no choice.

478
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400
I need to save His Majesty.

479
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Cheng Ruoyu,

480
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,960
my entire effort went down the drain

481
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,680
all because of you.

482
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Yanzhi,

483
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,480
now, you should save His Majesty
together with me.

484
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
In the future, I'll surely

485
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
join hands with you
and deal with Qiu Ziliang,

486
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
all right?

487
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,320
Qi Yan is dead.

488
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Qi Yan didn't come out

489
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
before the explosion.

490
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,160
That's impossible.

491
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,080
That's impossible!

492
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,320
Your Majesty!

493
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,560
Over here.

494
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,600
Hurry! Search for him!

495
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,600
Dig this out! Hurry!

496
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,320
Ask more men to help us out.

497
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,160
Yes, sir.

498
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,600
Come. Over there as well.

499
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,800
Be careful.

500
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,840
Lend me a hand.

501
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,440
- Lend me a hand.
- All right.

502
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
Help me out.

503
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,320
- We need two more men.
- Coming.

504
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,880
- On the count of three.
- All right.

505
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,040
Over there.

506
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,400
Be careful.

507
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,280
Take this.

508
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,520
Over here as well.

509
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,639
Come over here.

510
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,159
- Over there.
- Be careful.

511
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,679
Be careful.

512
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,280
- Get us some water.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,520
Commander Wang,

514
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,560
the fire has been extinguished.

515
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,080
There are no signs of Official Qiu.

516
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,679
I think there's a secret chamber
down there.

517
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
The fire was caused by
ignited gunpowder.

518
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
The ground collapsed because of it.

519
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,200
A secret chamber?

520
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
Gunpowder?

521
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Do you have a map of the secret chamber?

522
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Bring it to me!

523
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,360
It's inside the building.

524
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,720
Now,

525
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,520
I'm afraid it has been
turned into ashes.

526
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Useless fools!

527
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Continue digging!

528
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,560
I need to see his body

529
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,840
even if he's dead!

530
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,560
- Yes, Commander!
- Hurry.

531
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,920
- Over here.
- All right.

532
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,560
You guys, come over here!

533
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,280
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

534
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,280
Over here.

535
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,680
All right.

536
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,600
Someone!

537
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,280
Arrest her!

538
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,000
Commander Wang,

539
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,400
what do you mean by this?

540
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
I suspect that she has something to do
with this incident!

541
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
What evidence do you have?

542
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,360
It's obvious that
Zhenwu's military advisor

543
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,480
is the mastermind behind this incident.

544
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Commander Wang,

545
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,320
I don't know

546
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,720
what Cheng Ruoyu had told you,

547
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,000
but, the Violet Bureau

548
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,360
has always been on bad terms with us.

549
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
Please think twice

550
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,400
before you trust her.

551
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,240
Is that so?

552
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,880
At this crucial moment,

553
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,360
Father is trapped underground.

554
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,560
As his subordinates, you and I

555
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,640
should work together
and try to save him.

556
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,920
We shouldn't fight with each other.

557
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,800
Everyone, did you hear her?

558
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
She said she was
Grandfather's subordinate.

559
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,240
How dare you put yourself
on the same level as me

560
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,280
when you're just a wretch
who depends on her good looks?

561
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
Arrest her!

562
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,440
Commander Wang,

563
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
the Chess Bearer is
Official Qiu's favourite daughter.

564
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
You should know the consequences

565
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
if you treat her in this way.

566
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,720
Listen,

567
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,640
if Grandfather is fine,

568
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
she can continue to be
his precious daughter.

569
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,760
But, if something
happens to Grandfather...

570
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,520
Continue digging!

571
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,040
Yes, Commander.

572
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,000
Cheng Ruoyu.

573
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,120
Han Ding?

574
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,400
Yanzhi said

575
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,360
His Majesty was dead.

576
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,280
Come.

577
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
- Let's put our back into it.
- Yes, sir.

578
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,360
Hurry! Remove the rubble!

579
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,480
Commander Wang,

580
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
we found someone!

581
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,600
- Move everything to the side.
- All right.

582
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,160
Who is it?

583
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,840
Who is it?

584
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,320
Commander Wang,

585
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,160
we found someone!

586
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,160
Is it Grandfather?

587
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,000
Bring him out.

588
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,640
I think the body

589
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
belongs to one of the soldier.

590
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,600
Continue.

591
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,840
Continue digging!

592
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,480
Yes, Commander!

593
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,040
With their pace,

594
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,240
they will find his body sooner or later.

595
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,200
Everything will be worth it

596
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,640
as long as Qiu Ziliang is dead.

597
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
What if he's still alive?

598
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,520
If that's the case,

599
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
I'll have to resign to my fate then.

600
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,920
There's another body over here!

601
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,720
Dig his body out!

602
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,480
There's another body here.

603
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,440
We found another body!

604
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,000
Who is it?

605
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,160
It belongs to another soldier.

606
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,200
Be careful.

607
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,640
Be careful.

608
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,960
Will we be able to help Prince Guang
ascend the throne

609
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,080
within four hours?

610
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,320
That's impossible,

611
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,040
am I right?

612
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,320
But, at least we can confirm

613
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,240
whether Qiu Ziliang and Qi Yan

614
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,680
are still alive or not.

615
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,560
How do you plan to confirm that?

616
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,720
Although the Eta Ursae Majoris exit
has been destroyed,

617
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,240
the Alpha Ursae Majoris exit
is quite far away from it.

618
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
I think it should be intact.

619
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,520
You wish to investigate the situation by
using the Alpha Ursae Majoris exit?

620
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,280
But, we have to hide this
from everyone here.

621
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,120
What should we do?

622
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880
Tell Wang Lin

623
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
that although the map was destroyed,

624
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,200
there's a spare map

625
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,640
in the Left Minister's library.

626
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,200
He'll only give the map to me

627
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,320
when I visit him personally.

628
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,320
They'll be able to speed up
the process with the map.

629
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I'll ask him to release me.

630
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,440
What if Wang Lin tries to get the map
from the Left Minister himself?

631
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,440
He doesn't dare to do it.

632
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,280
Before the Left Minister's retirement,

633
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,320
he was one of the eunuchs as well.

634
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,800
He still has some lingering authority.

635
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,000
Commander Wang.

636
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,120
Commander Wang,

637
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
the Chess Bearer has something
to discuss with you.

638
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,360
I've passed your message to him.

639
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,520
You better don't try anything funny.

640
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm just

641
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,440
a weak woman
who can't even defend myself.

642
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,800
What can I do?

643
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:15,960
You,

644
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,920
and you,

645
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,960
keep an eye

646
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,600
on them.

647
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,360
Make haste.

648
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,040
- Yes, Commander.
- Yes, Commander.

649
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,160
What are you looking at?

650
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,120
I just wonder

651
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,240
how your face will look like

652
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,240
when you have to call me Mother.

653
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,960
Don't worry,

654
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,840
when Father has returned,

655
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,120
I will ask him to command you to do so.

656
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,600
Farewell,

657
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,720
Commander Wang.
