I'm fine.

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
Someone wants to see you.

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Come in!

Your Majesty!

The divine healer has been waiting
for a while.

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
Your Majesty.

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Let the divine healer

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,560
treat you.

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
Your Majesty!

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm begging you.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Divine healer.

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
His Majesty won't accept treatment.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
What should we do?

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,360
The cause of the problem
must be the one who solves it.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
Find that person.

34
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Divine healer.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,720
If she doesn't come,

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
what should we do?

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,280
If she won't come,

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
Eunuch Cheng,

39
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
prepare

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,600
His Majesty's burial then.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,600
Divine healer.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,680
Divine healer!

43
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,640
Prince Guang said

44
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,800
that if I came to talk to you,

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
he didn't think this would work.

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,880
But even so,

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
I still want to come and see you.

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
What is this about?

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
Qi Yan is dead.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Do you

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,360
feel happy?

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,240
I don't want to answer that.

53
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,160
This is a very important question.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
It concerns whether or not

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
we can become friends.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
I really don't know.

57
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
Everything

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
that's been happening lately

59
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
is like a dream.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,200
The Shu Region

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,960
once had a kind of silk given
as tribute before.

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
It was dazzling,

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
pure, flawless,

64
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
soft, and smooth.

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
Any pen and ink

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
can't leave a mark on it.

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
To me,

68
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
you are that kind of silk.

69
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,600
Hatred can't corrupt
your heart and mind.

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,640
You're still that righteous

71
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,200
and brave girl I met back then.

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
I know.

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Even if you can't forgive me now,

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
if I'm in danger,

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
you'll surely help me.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,160
Ruoling.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,000
His Majesty isn't dead.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
If you're willing to help,

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,960
he still has a chance to live.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Are you

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,600
willing to do that?

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,360
You're done talking?

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,000
Did she agree?

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,320
She's still thinking about it.

85
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Earlier,

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
Eunuch Cheng came to hurry us again.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I know.

88
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,400
But we must give Ruoling some time.

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
What about you?

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Me?

91
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,640
You were willing to come
and convince Ruoling

92
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,280
to forgive His Majesty.

93
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you willing to forgive him?

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
My thoughts

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,120
might be different
from an ordinary person's.

96
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
To me,

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,080
my hatred

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,480
is not just on an individual.

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Qiu Ziliang is savage and inhumane.

100
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,800
He's taking the emperor hostage in order
to control the imperial court.

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Who gave him that kind of power?

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
And Qi Yan isn't a bad person.

103
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did he acknowledge a traitor
as his godfather

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,480
and help Qiu Ziliang kill wise
and righteous people?

105
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,880
If I don't figure out the reasons
for those two things,

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
the Morning Dew Rebellion
will keep happening

107
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,320
and more people will suffer misfortunes.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
Yes.

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Xing

110
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,160
was once prosperous.

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,600
Now, why is it in decline?

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
The emperor is useless

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,960
while the eunuchs have absolute power.

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
Officials are competing for power.

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,680
It's hard to establish a nation,

116
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,400
and even harder to maintain it.

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
So,

118
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,280
when Qiu Ziliang and his faction

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,880
are not eliminated

120
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
and people's morale are still low,

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
I don't want Qi Yan to die.

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
I want him to live

123
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,000
and see our hard work

124
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,320
and even work together with us

125
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,320
to change the situation step by step.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,360
We'll fight together.

127
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,360
Let's go.

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,600
Why isn't she here yet?

129
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Why do you just arrive?

130
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
I want to speak with His Majesty alone.

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,760
All right.

132
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,320
His Majesty didn't summon you.

133
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,040

134
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160

I have something to ask you.

210
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,520
You told me

211
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,840
that Prince Guang did all of this.

212
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,760
He pretended to be Right Minister

213
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,600
and controlled Chess of Generals Camp.

214
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,160
He was the one

215
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,840
who wanted to kill you and Qiu Ziliang

216
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,320
through Han Yue.

217
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,080
He was the one who worked together
with Qiu Yanzhi

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,000
to make Qiu Ziliang
meditate in isolation.

219
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,640
I can't believe all of these things.

220
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,000
That was why we put on an act

221
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
in front of Yanzhi.

222
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,680
I pretended to be on the verge of death,

223
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
so that you

224
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,960
can test what Uncle is really thinking.

225
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,920
Yes.

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,200
The answer is just as I expected.

227
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,080
He doesn't plan to become emperor.

228
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,440
He just wants to help you
become stable in your position

229
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
and to eliminate the eunuch's faction.

230
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Everything

231
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,320
is just

232
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
the one-sided ambition of Aunt.

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,400
So, Your Majesty...

234
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,280
Since we can put on an act,

235
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,800
who knows if he's acting too?

236
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,440
Your Majesty.

237
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,960
What are you planning to do?

238
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,120
Go into the dark from the light.

239
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,280
In this chess game,

240
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm the third party.

241
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
What are you looking at?

242
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
Who exactly is she?

243
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,080
What does that have to do with you?

244
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,160
I told you many times.

245
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

246
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,760
Don't look at what you shouldn't.

247
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,080
It's useless anyway.

248
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,120
Go.

249
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Go.

250
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,079
Why are you...

251
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,560
Greetings, Ms. Yanzhi.

252
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
How is His Majesty's condition?

253
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,800
He's recovering.

254
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,119
There's hope for him now.

255
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,000
He's a devoted man.

256
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,520
That's good too.

257
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,600
If Ruoling

258
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,080
can really move on from this,

259
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,480
she'll feel happier too.

260
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,000
What's the matter?

261
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
You want to ask me something?

262
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Not really.

263
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Ms. Yanzhi.

264
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
You're so nice to Yu'er.

265
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Compared to Qiu...

266
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
You're different

267
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,560
from Official Qiu.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,880
Eunuch Cheng.

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes.

270
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
You're a good person.

271
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,000
A good person

272
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
will receive good karma.

273
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,360
Are you wearing the soft armor?

274
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Yes.

275
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,680
Your Majesty.

276
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,080
Everything's ready.

277
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,520
Very good.

278
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
It's time for us to attack.

279
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,360
Yes.

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
It's not good to torment
Prince Guang this way,

281
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,520
isn't it?

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We're just giving him a taste
of his own medicine.

283
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Besides,

284
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,880
once a person gets into a character
for too long,

285
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,840
he'll even fool himself.

286
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,720
So,

287
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,720
in order to see him
for who he really is,

288
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,440
we must let him remove his mask first.

289
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,080
Am I right, Yu'er?

290
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:17,000
(Chess of Generals Camp)

291
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,440
Chess Overseer.

292
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,520
What's the matter?

293
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,760
Official Qiu

294
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,280
commanded me to give this to you.

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,320
When did Father find out?

296
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,360
(Chess of Generals Camp)

297
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
You mean, about His Majesty's
critical condition?

298
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,920
The palace immediately

299
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,200
sent news, of course.

300
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Even if Official Qiu
is on an isolated meditation,

301
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
he's still very concerned

302
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,800
about you and His Majesty.

303
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,280
All right.

304
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,320
I still need to go back
and protect Official Qiu.

305
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,000
Please get ready

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,280
for what's written here.

307
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,500
(Chess of Generals Camp)

308
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,240
Wasn't the news sealed in the palace?

309
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,480
Who sent news

310
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
to Official Qiu?

311
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,500
(Enter the palace and marry Qi Yan
as a concubine within three days)

312
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Official Qiu wants you
to enter the palace

313
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
and marry Qi Yan as a consort
within three days.

314
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,840
Why?

315
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,200
Why did he suddenly

316
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,120
give such an order?

317
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
Qi Yan almost died.

318
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,200
Qiu Ziliang is afraid
that it might happen again.

319
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
But if Qi Yan dies,

320
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Prince Guang is still around, isn't he?

321
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Isn't Official Qiu planning

322
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
to hostage Prince Guang
and make him emperor?

323
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
It seems like

324
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,080
he has changed his mind now.

325
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,080
He wants you to become

326
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,000
the second female emperor.

327
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,080
I don't know.

328
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm very scared now.

329
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,040
Qi Yan harmed himself this time,

330
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,800
and it caused great chaos.

331
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm afraid Qiu Ziliang

332
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,880
found out certain things.

333
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,960
That's impossible.

334
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
That's impossible.

335
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
Right Chariot is still there.

336
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,240
Even if something happened
to Official Qiu,

337
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,800
he'll surely inform us at once.

338
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,720
Could it be

339
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,440
that Right Chariot betrayed us,

340
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,520
or

341
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Official Qiu is hiding it

342
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,280
from him as well?

343
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,720
Anything is possible.

344
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,880
Aside from you,

345
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
I don't trust anyone.

346
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
Qiu Ziliang's move

347
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,760
may be too abrupt,

348
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,920
but it's the same

349
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,880
as my previous thoughts.

350
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
It's doable.

351
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,360
You're really going to marry Qi Yan?

352
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,520
Three days.

353
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,040
Once the edict is out,

354
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,000
I can't change it.

355
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,520
You're really willing

356
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,360
to go into a marriage

357
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
without any love?

358
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,120
Xiu.

359
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,840
Xiu.

360
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,560
If I forget my intention
because of personal relationships,

361
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,160
how can I face the Wang clan?

362
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
But Qing...

363
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,360
So don't keep reminding me,

364
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,400
advising me,

365
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,400
and shaking my determination.

366
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,120
What I need is support.

367
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
And in this world,

368
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,760
the only one who can give me that

369
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,320
is you.

370
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,840
Yes,

371
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
Chess Overseer.

372
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
Something happened
in Qiu Ziliang's side?

373
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,000
Two hours ago,

374
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,080
he brought out

375
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,560
an imperial edict for Left Chariot

376
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,080
to bring to the palace.

377
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,800
It's an imperial edict
to appoint a consort.

378
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,240
After three days,

379
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,760
Qiu Yanzhi will enter the palace

380
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,280
and receive the title of Consort Shu.

381
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,670
(Prison)

382
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Let me out!

383
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Thirteen!

384
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Thirteen, you're a bastard!

385
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm your sister!

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,760
Let me out!

387
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,160
Thirteen!

388
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,400
You jerk!

389
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,680
Thirteen!

390
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
You want to come out?

391
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,840
Answer three questions,

392
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
and I'll let you out.

393
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
What questions?

394
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,800
First.

395
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,720
Is Cheng Ruoyu Wang Ruoling?

396
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,080
Second.

397
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,160
Is His Highness Prince Guang
the Right Minister?

398
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,840
Third.

399
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
What is the relationship
between Yanzhi, Wang Ruoling,

400
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,960
and Prince Guang?

401
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,160
Why are you leaving?

402
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,920
Can't you stay a few more days?

403
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
His Majesty is still unwell.

404
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
You can leave

405
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
after he recovers.

406
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,840
I think he has already recovered.

407
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
He can even get married now.

408
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,680
Look at what you're saying.

409
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,280
Isn't Qiu Ziliang...

410
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Isn't Official Qiu
forcing him to do that?

411
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,680
Let her leave.

412
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Your Majesty.

413
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Let her leave!

414
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,680
If you want to leave,

415
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,440
where will you go?

416
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Where should we find you?

417
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,880
Can I give you a suggestion?

418
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,760
Xumuyuan in Sanyuan County.

419
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,000
Your Majesty!

420
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
What you're saying...

421
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
What you're saying makes me feel...

422
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
What is that place?

423
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,240
That's the tomb built for His Majesty.

424
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,040
Your Majesty.

425
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,080
You may all go.

426
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,200
I won't die yet.

427
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,560
I'm still getting married.

428
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,280
What are you looking at?

429
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
Go!

430
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,600
Wang Yang was good to me.

431
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,560
After the Wang family was eliminated,

432
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,360
I thought

433
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,720
that I should do something.

434
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,360
For father,

435
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
brother,

436
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,440
and also myself.

437
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,560
If Qiu Ziliang

438
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,320
is the cause of all of these things,

439
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,480
then

440
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll kill him.

441
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
In the end,

442
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
my sister betrayed me,

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,800
and Qiu Ziliang is still alive.

444
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,800
I can't even protect

445
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
Wang Yang's granddaughters.

446
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,680
It's all in vain.

447
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,280
Everything's in vain.

448
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,280
In the end,

449
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,080
everything's in vain indeed.

450
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,200
Your Majesty.

451
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,320
What happened?

452
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
Things are going smoothly
on Gao Ping's side.

453
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,640
Everything's going according to plan.

454
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,080
Then you can tell Yanzhi

455
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,200
about what's going on with Gao Ping.

456
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Tell her?

457
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,360
I really want to know

458
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,480
why she kept wanting

459
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,360
to save Yu'er.

460
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,840
There must be

461
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
a reason for her

462
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,600
to protect Yu'er

463
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
even at the risk
of becoming Qiu Ziliang's enemy.

464
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,280
Could she really be...

465
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Who?

466
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,440
Wang Ruoqing.

467
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,440
Does Yu'er know?

468
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,600
This is just my guess.

469
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,200
Even if we confirm it,

470
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,520
we can't tell Yu'er.

471
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,880
Otherwise, she won't

472
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,720
leave Heng'an.

473
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,720
Right.

474
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,200
If she stays here,

475
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
you can't go all out.

476
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,960
This is a life-or-death fight.

477
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,520
If we win,

478
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,280
everybody's happy.

479
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,040
But if we lose,

480
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
we'll see each other in Xumuyuan.

481
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,320
Yes.

482
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,240
Your Majesty.

483
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,680
I'll go ahead.

484
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,800
Take care.

485
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,400
This male servant

486
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
said that he came to deliver news

487
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
based on His Majesty's order.

488
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm not a male servant.

489
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,280
You are.

490
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,970
(Virtuous and prestigious)

491
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
In the past six months,

492
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
I've sent someone
to watch Gao Ping secretly.

493
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,400
On a rainy night three months ago,

494
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,080
Gao Ping brought a mysterious person.

495
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,520
This person moved strangely

496
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,200
and has great martial arts skill.

497
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
I never found out who he is.

498
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
He left about half a month ago.

499
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Two hours ago,

500
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,640
he returned.

501
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,960
And this time,

502
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,400
he brought another person.

503
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,840
That person is Cheng Xi.

504
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,960
When did you find out
that she's missing?

505
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
She was still here at dinner time.

506
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,440
She's been missing
for at most four hours.

507
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,120
The person who came
has good martial arts skill.

508
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
Where is Shi?

509
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,080
In Violet Bureau.

510
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,480
Madam Jade is watching her.

511
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,360
Logically,

512
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
Madam Cheng

513
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,760
doesn't have anyone she can utilize.

514
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,080
Also,

515
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,120
how can he take her away

516
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
from Chess of Generals Camp

517
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
without anyone knowing?

518
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,840
He works for Qiu Ziliang.

519
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,960
He didn't stay with Cheng Xi for long

520
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,440
before noticing
that we were watching him,

521
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
so he escaped.

522
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,560
That person has a problem
with his right leg.

523
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,239
It's Left Chariot.

524
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,480
So

525
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,719
Cheng Ruoyu is Wang Ruoling indeed.

526
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,679
Am I right?

527
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,040
I knew it.

528
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,800
Based on Qiu Ziliang's personality,

529
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
how can he meditate in isolation
for four months?

530
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,040
It turns out that he's hiding
in the dark

531
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,920
and waiting for us to go into chaos.

532
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,440
Ling Ling.

533
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,880
Ling Ling is here.

534
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,360
His Majesty said

535
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,520
that the one most in danger now

536
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,600
is Ms. Cheng Ruoyu.

537
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,720
Qiu Ziliang

538
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,160
might already know

539
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,800
her identity.

540
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,840
Xiu.

541
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,800
You two leave first.

542
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Yes.

543
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,360
Follow me.

544
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,840
You're here.

545
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,760
Yes.

546
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
I came uninvited

547
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,400
to tell you something.

548
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,720
Are you here to congratulate me?

549
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,600
I heard

550
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,760
that Qiu Ziliang is forcing you
to marry His Majesty.

551
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,080
Forcing me?

552
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,240
Don't be silly.

553
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,560
I want nothing more than that.

554
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,240
What's the matter?

555
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,560
Are you jealous of me?

556
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,400
It's fine if you are.

557
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,160
I won't laugh at you.

558
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,800
Silly girl.

559
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
You're drunk.

560
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,080
Yes.

561
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,280
I am.

562
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,200
It's good to be drunk.

563
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
My worries are forgotten.

564
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
I dare to do anything I want.

565
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,280
And I dare to say anything I want.

566
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Then

567
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,200
do you have anything to say to me?

568
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Don't worry.

569
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,200
I'll take good care of His Majesty.

570
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,720
Without you,

571
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,080
Qi Yan and I will love each other

572
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,360
and grow old together.

573
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,840
Stop drinking.

574
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Go.

575
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,200
Yanzhi.

576
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,880
Go.

577
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Get as far away as you can.

578
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
In this lifetime,

579
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,200
I don't want to see you again.

580
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,600
Yanzhi.

581
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,800
Didn't you hear me?

582
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
I told you to get lost!

583
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll get going then.

584
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,000
(I'm sorry, Ruoling.)

585
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,080
(Qiu Ziliang and I)

586
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,240
(will have an intense battle soon.)

587
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,320
(It's hard to know if I'll survive.)

588
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,800
(You're the only bloodline
the Wang family has left.)

589
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,680
(No matter what happens,)

590
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,680
(I must protect you.)

591
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,680
(So)

592
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
(leave this place now.)

593
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Ruoling.

594
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,600
Ruoling?

595
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,720
Ruoling.

596
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,720
Ruoling.

597
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,480
Ruoling.

598
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,280
Ruoling.

599
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,320
Ruo...

600
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,080
Guards!

601
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Guards!

602
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,680
Ling Ling.

603
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,040
Ling Ling.

604
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Ling Ling.

605
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,040
Your Majesty.

606
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,840
Are you really getting married?

607
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,960
What about Ms. Li?

608
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,520
Actually, you want to ask

609
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,880
what about Yu'er, don't you?

610
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,880
Your Majesty.

611
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
How can I hope for that?

612
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:44,026
Huaizhi.

613
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,680
Yes.

614
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,600
It's fine.

615
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,440
(Huaizhi.)

616
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,520
(Someday, I hope)

617
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,680
(that I can do as you wish.)

618
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
Go and make arrangements.

619
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
I want to see Uncle.

620
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,240
Yes.

621
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,900
(Duke Chu's goddaughter Qiu Yanzhi is
virtuous, prudent, diligent, and gentle)

622
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,300
(Yanzhi will enter the palace
and be given the title of Consort Shu)

623
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,470
(This is the imperial command)

624
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,080
How is she?

625
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
The external wounds are fine.

626
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,680
It seems like her brain
suffered a blow.

627
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,480
She might remember the past.

628
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,600
You mean

629
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,760
her memories are back?

630
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,080
Based on the situation,

631
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
she hasn't recovered
her memories yet.

632
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,280
If this happens a few more times,

633
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,040
her condition isn't optimistic.

634
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,520
She should take care of herself.

635
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,520
What are you planning to do?

636
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,000
You still won't tell her who you are?

637
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,960
Cheng Xi is in Qiu Ziliang's hands now.

638
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,320
Qiu Ziliang might know

639
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,320
that Ling Ling is my sister.

640
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,960
He won't let go

641
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,920
of such a thing against me.

642
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,320
That's why Ling Ling
must leave immediately.

643
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,520
If I tell her who I am,

644
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,120
do you think

645
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,400
that she'll leave

646
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
based on her personality?

647
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,160
This always happens.

648
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,320
The timing isn't right.

649
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,680
Before,

650
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,240
I didn't dare to tell her who I am.

651
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,440
Now,

652
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,800
I can't.

653
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,160
Then I'll go and make
preparations first.

654
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,840
I've already sent people

655
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
to watch things on Official Qiu's side.

656
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,320
Things are still quiet for now.

657
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,080
