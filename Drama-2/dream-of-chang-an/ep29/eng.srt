14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,700
(Chess of Generals Camp)

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,760
You said

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
that Right Minister
saved you in advance.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
What does that mean?

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm not sure either.

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
I can't figure him out.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,479
This is the first time

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
that I have felt...

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,520
so helpless about anyone.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
I don't know what he wants to do.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
And I don't know
what to do with him either.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,360
I keep telling myself

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
that I can't believe him.

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
But in my heart,

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
I do.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,920
What did he say?

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,720
He said

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
that everything he's doing

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
is to eliminate the eunuch's faction,

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,640
and make Xing prosper again.

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
You don't believe it,

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,160
right?

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
I don't believe that there's
anyone like that

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,040
in this world.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
But I've met someone like that.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
When a citizen was sick before,

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
(Chess Ancestor Shennong)
Shennong started tasting hundreds of herbs

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,160
to check their effects

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,480
and distinguish their roles in medicine.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
Even if I can't compare to Emperor Yan,

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,200
I must still be loyal.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
It's precisely because I've met
someone like him

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,000
that I can't help but believe him.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
What is Qiu Ziliang doing?

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,480
He's gone.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
He's gone?

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,720
General.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
How is the situation outside?

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,280
Aside from you and Jiang Ding,

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
other Central Command
Assistant Generals are all dead.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,640
It's a trick!

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,440
General.

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,400
If Eunuch Qiu falls,

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
what should you do?

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
If he doesn't fall, I'll die too!

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,160
This won't do.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
It's too dangerous in Heng'an.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,760
Prepare a steed and money for me.

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
I must leave this place.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes.

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
What about Physician Shen?

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,840
He already committed suicide
by taking poison.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,920
What a shame.

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,960
How's Jiang Ding?

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
He's ambitious.

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,680
And his son is in my hands.

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,960
He'll keep his mouth shut.

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,200
Even if he confesses,

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
he'll only mention me.

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
He definitely won't drag you down.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
The only problem now

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,920
is Yuan Xing.

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,240
He's not dead?

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,960
No.

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,760
But he won't be able to wake up either.

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,400
What if he does?

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
I replaced

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,560
all the servants

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,320
around Yuan Xing.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,960
They can make a move at any time.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
In ten days, Misha and the Zhenwu Army

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,880
will meet up.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,960
After ten days,

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
Qi Yan's crisis

88
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,400
will be over.

89
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Uncle.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
Can we still connect Yu'er's bones?

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,880
Yes.

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,120
Really?

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
Right Advisor was lenient with her.

94
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,200
Your Majesty.

95
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,360
Is your wound infected again?

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,880
Your Majesty.

97
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm fine.

98
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,760
Why do you both

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,720
worry people so much?

100
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,320
All right.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll stop.

102
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,480
Anyway, you won't listen

103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,440
to me either.

104
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,960
No.

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
We'll surely focus
on recovering this time.

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
That's great.

107
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Your Majesty.

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,400
I bid my leave.

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,720
Thank you, Uncle.

110
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Focus on recovering.

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Take your medicines on time.

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
You're hungry?

113
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
Are you going to give me
something delicious to eat?

114
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,240
Of course.

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,920
I told Huaizhi

116
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
to prepare cherry pastry for you.

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,000
How did you know

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
that I like cherry pastry?

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,000
How can I not know?

120
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,280
Didn't I tell you earlier?

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,960
I told Huaizhi to prepare it for you.

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
Why did you ask Uncle about that?

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
I asked him

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,720
how he met you back then,

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,400
and how did you suddenly become

126
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840
his niece.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,640
He said

128
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
that when he saw you,

129
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
you were eating pastry

130
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,360
like a starving ghost.

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
He thought that you'd be easy to feed.

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
That's not true.

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm picky with food.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
I won't eat the cherry pastry

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,520
if it's not

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,640
from General Han Yue's house.

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,040
Yu'er.

138
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,960
You've eaten the cherry pastry

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
from Han Yue's house?

140
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,080
I also don't know

141
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
why I said that.

142
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
When I saw Han Yue,

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
I didn't remember the pastry.

144
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,960
Why did I say that?

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,880
Why?

146
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,040
I...

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,280
Yu'er.

148
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,120
That's not important.

149
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
That's not important at all.

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,240
Your identity isn't important either.

151
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,400
What's important then?

152
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,400
You.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Stop overthinking things.

154
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,880
Get some sleep.

155
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,760
Glose your eyes.

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,880
Be good. Listen to me.

157
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Bad news.

158
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
Official Qiu is back.

159
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,840
He appointed Nine
as the new Right Chariot.

160
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,640
Father, you didn't come home all night.

161
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,960
I was very worried.

162
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm fine.

163
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,520
Come here first.

164
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,360
Listen to Right Chariot's report.

165
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes.

166
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,840
In the name

167
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,080
of picking up Princess Misha,

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
the Zhenwu Army is coming here fiercely.

169
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,880
Those in the border checkpoints
didn't dare to stop them.

170
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,560
This is a letter I stole

171
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,480
from their military camp.

172
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,160
You went to the Zhenwu military camp?

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
I was originally

174
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
stationed in Yunzhou.

175
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,840
(Chess of Generals Camp, New Right Chariot)
I came back after stealing the letter.

176
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,620
(Qi Yan keeps harming Princess Misha.
Mobilize troops to save her. Cheng Xi)

177
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,760
Cheng Xi is so bold.

178
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
I can't believe
that she's secretly colluding

179
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,760
with Zhenwu.

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,600
If Cheng Ruoyu didn't make a fuss,

181
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
we wouldn't have found out.

182
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
Left Advisor.

183
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,400
You still haven't found Cheng Xi?

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
Father.

185
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Yesterday, Cheng Xi

186
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,560
kidnapped me and took me to a place
around the Yuzhen Hall area.

187
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
Right Minister
and Left Advisor went there.

188
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
Even if they were able to save me,

189
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
unfortunately, Cheng Xi got away.

190
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Please give me three more days.

191
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
We'll surely capture Cheng Xi.

192
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,800
No.

193
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
You have another mission.

194
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
I heard that Central Commander Yuan
is in a coma.

195
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,720
I especially found

196
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,760
a local divine healer to treat him.

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
He checked
Central Commander Yuan earlier.

198
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
He said that he could be saved.

199
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,640
Your Majesty.

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,320
Duke Chu is sick,

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,320
and he's on leave.

202
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,200
He didn't come.

203
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,240
Your Majesty.

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
Yesterday, Shencai Army
Central Commander Yuan Xing

205
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
and Shi Yuan had an internal conflict.

206
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
During their fight,

207
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
four assistant generals were killed.

208
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Yuan Xing himself is seriously injured
and in a coma.

209
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Now, the Shencai Army is in a panic.

210
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,800
We need to appoint
new central commanders.

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
I've already made a list.

212
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Please take a look.

213
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Your Majesty.

214
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,660
(The proposal of Shencai Army's
new  Central Commanders)

215
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,440
Your Majesty.

216
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Duke Chu manages the Shencai Army.

217
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
In appointing new central commanders,

218
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,640
shouldn't we

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
consult him?

220
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,060
(Memorial to the Throne)

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,880
Duke Chu indulged his subordinates

222
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,480
and failed to supervise them well,

223
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
causing the imperial court to lose

224
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,720
six talented generals today.

225
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
From now on,

226
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
he's no longer
the Shencai Army General-in-chief.

227
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,560
Han Ding will replace him.

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
As for the new central commanders,

229
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
let's follow this list.

230
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,360
You're dismissed.

231
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,240
Your Majesty.

232
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,240
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

233
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
The divine healer said
that Central Commander Yuan

234
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,080
is not in a coma

235
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,480
because Shi Yuan wounded him.

236
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
It's because someone forcefully

237
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,680
hit his Fengchi acupuncture point

238
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
through his Neiguan acupuncture point
before that.

239
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
It's very strange
to kill someone this way.

240
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Unless

241
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
his objective is to cover it up.

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
There are very few

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,000
who can

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
do this secretly

245
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,120
with everyone watching.

246
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
In Chess of Generals Camp,

247
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,360
only two people can do that.

248
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
Left and Right Advisors.

249
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,280
Right Advisor was beside me back then.

250
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,960
Of course that's impossible.

251
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Left Advisor.

252
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
Was it you?

253
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,640
Will hitting the Fengchi acupuncture
point via the Neiguan one

254
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,880
really work in making someone

255
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
instantly fall into a coma?

256
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,960
We need to try it.

257
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,640
(Qi Ang.)

258
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,040
(Teacher.)

259
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,520
(Did you see that?)

260
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
(I did it.)

261
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,160
(First step.)

262
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
(Take his military authority.)

263
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
(Second step.)

264
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,760
(Eliminate his comrades.)

265
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,800
You may go.

266
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

267
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Are you hungry?

268
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,920
You want breakfast?

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Nothing's here.

270
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
There's no breakfast?

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
You're making me hungry too.

272
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,360
Your Majesty.

273
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,920
Your Majesty.

274
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
If you're hungry,

275
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,840
guess what this is.

276
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
It smells very refreshing.

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,320
It should be a kind of leaf.

278
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,920
You have a great sense of smell.

279
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,120
It's pagoda leaves.

280
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Cold pagoda noodles?

281
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,680
You ate your favorite yesterday.

282
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,040
Today, try my favorite.

283
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,960
Your favorite is cold pagoda noodles?

284
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,760
Why haven't I seen you

285
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,920
eat it before?

286
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,720
Because...

287
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,359
Because when I was little,

288
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,280
I loved running away from home.

289
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,359
One time, Qi Ang caught me,

290
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
and he asked me three questions.

291
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
What were they?

292
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,280
Do you have people?

293
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,640
Do you have authority?

294
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,360
Do you have money?

295
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,240
Back then,

296
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,640
I didn't know

297
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,200
what they meant indeed.

298
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,560
I only realized

299
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,520
after growing up

300
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
that in doing anything,

301
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,240
you must rely on those three things.

302
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,040
What happened afterwards?

303
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,520
Afterwards,

304
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
since I made a mistake,

305
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,440
I admitted my mistake.

306
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Then Qi Ang

307
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,200
commanded people to cut off
the pagoda tree

308
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,760
and bring it back to the palace.

309
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,240
He personally used the leaves

310
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
to make noodles for me.

311
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
And he said three things again.

312
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
What are they?

313
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,800
Do you regret it?

314
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,000
Does it hurt?

315
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Are you happy?

316
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,760
"Are you happy?"

317
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
If you know

318
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
that you've made a mistake,

319
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,040
and you regret it,

320
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,840
you can start over.

321
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,080
Since Qi Ang died,

322
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,240
I never ate

323
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,600
cold pagoda noodles again.

324
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
The late emperor must really love you.

325
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,400
I was the one he loved the most.

326
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Regarding the late emperor and I...

327
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,320
Before

328
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,600
that happened,

329
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,920
I already acknowledged Qiu Ziliang
as my godfather.

330
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,200
That's not important.

331
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,080
It's not important at all.

332
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
What's important then?

333
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Happiness.

334
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,440
Happiness.

335
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
(Library of Historical Records)

336
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,960
Everyone!

337
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
His Majesty has orders

338
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,600
to search the city and capture
these two criminals.

339
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,800
(Conspirator Cheng Xi. Perpetrator, Shi Yuan)
If you have any reliable news,

340
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,840
you'll be rewarded with 100,000 tael.

341
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,000
100,000 tael?

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,040
- That's a lot of money!
- That's a lot!

343
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,280
Everyone!

344
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
Listen carefully.

345
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,280
His Majesty has orders

346
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,600
to search the city and capture
these two criminals.

347
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,040
He's not awake yet.

348
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,120
They won't allow anyone to see him.

349
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,680
Did you find out Shi Yuan's background?

350
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,480
Not yet.

351
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,120
Check Right Chariot too.

352
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,920
I suspect that he has other motives

353
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
in coming back this time.

354
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,920
Yes.

355
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,960
You're going

356
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
to give me babies.

357
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
Why do you still feel embarrassed?

358
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,080
All right.

359
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
You're seriously injured,

360
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,200
and you can't move.

361
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Stay here,

362
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
so that I can take good care of you.

363
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I can go back to Violet Bureau.

364
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,640
But we haven't

365
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
found Cheng Xi yet.

366
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,680
What if she returns?

367
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,800
Don't think too much.

368
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
There's surely a way to resolve this.

369
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,840
You can't sleep?

370
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,800
You're thinking about your aunt?

371
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,680
Your Majesty.

372
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
After eight days,

373
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
will it really be over?

374
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,400
The precondition

375
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,040
is for everything to go well.

376
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,880
But I'm afraid

377
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,400
that it won't go so smoothly.

378
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
With you here,

379
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm not scared of anything.

380
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
No matter what happens,

381
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,240
I'm not alone.

382
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,400
You're with me.

383
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,440
Your Majesty, watch out!

384
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,600
Your Majesty!

385
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,160
Your Majesty!

386
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
Protect His Majesty!

387
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
Guards! Protect His Majesty!

388
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,440
Your Majesty.

389
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,760
Your Majesty.

390
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,360
Guards!

391
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,440
Your Majesty!

392
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,240
Your Majesty.

393
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,800
Guards!

394
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,920
Your Majesty.

395
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Your Majesty!

396
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,120
Your Majesty.

397
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,360
Your Majesty.

398
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,120
What happened, Your Majesty?

399
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Seal the palace gates!

400
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,200
No one can go out.

401
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,040
Go.

402
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,640
Yes.

403
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,600
Did something happen?

404
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,120
Your Majesty.

405
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,760
Your Majesty!

406
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,560
Your Majesty!

407
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,360
Your Majesty.

408
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Bad news, sir!

409
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,000
Sir!

410
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,320
Sir, bad news!

411
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,880
A lot of men in black are outside!

412
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,080
Shi Yuan has been captured.

413
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,800
Where is he?

414
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,560
In the palace.

415
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,280
He was captured when attempting
to assassinate Qi Yan.

416
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
Qi Yan is seriously injured.

417
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,280
Official Qiu entered
the palace in advance.

418
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,280
How are you feeling?

419
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,880
Are you all right?

420
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,440
Father.

421
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,920
Sir.

422
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm afraid that His Majesty's injury...

423
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm afraid...

424
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,960
What?

425
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm afraid that he won't last long.

426
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,280
He won't last long?

427
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
How long then?

428
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,360
At most, one month.

429
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,400
At the minimum, these few days.

430
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
What are you talking about?

431
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,160
How many days?

432
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,760
Slap yourself.

433
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,800
- Slap yourself!
- Your Majesty.

434
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
How many days?

435
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll slap you!

436
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,880
I'll slap you!

437
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,320
Eunuch Cheng.

438
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,040
Don't be anxious.

439
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,200
You may all go.

440
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,440
Yes.

441
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,040
Scram!

442
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,920
Get away!

443
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,840
What do I need you all for?

444
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,960
To give you rewards?

445
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,120
What do I need you for?

446
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,960
You just enter the palace
when you want to.

447
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,640
You just attempt an assassination
when you want to.

448
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
I'll kick you to death.

449
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,840
I'll kick you to death!

450
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Bah!

451
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
Yuan Xing was jealous of my promotion,

452
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,040
and he tried to frame me.

453
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,520
His Majesty wants to arrest me

454
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,440
without distinguishing between
what's right and wrong!

455
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Instead of dying
due to a false accusation,

456
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
I should just take a chance!

457
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
I'll fight with you!

458
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,120
I'll kill you!

459
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,640
I'll kill you!

460
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,320
I'll kick you to death!

461
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Eunuch Cheng.

462
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,080
You can kill him

463
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,120
after listening to what happened.

464
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,840
Central Commander Shi.

465
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
Tell us everything

466
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,160
that happened

467
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
that day.

468
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,520
Yes, sir.

469
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,920
That day,

470
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,280
I invited friends from the military
for drinks.

471
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,400
Yuan Xing didn't want to come.

472
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,200
Forget that he wasn't coming.

473
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,040
He even told others not to come.

474
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,760
Madam Cheng is already
safely out of the city.

475
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,480
Shi Yuan entered the palace
to assassinate His Majesty

476
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,120
and got captured.

477
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
His Majesty is very seriously injured.

478
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,280
I'm afraid...

479
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,840
And I just found out

480
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,960
that Shi Yuan has

481
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,080
an unknown talent.

482
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,120
He has sharp eyes and ears

483
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,000
and great memory.

484
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm afraid that Yan Xiu...

485
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Qiu Ziliang might be suspecting

486
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,160
Yanzhi and Yan Xiu.

487
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,240
What should we do?

488
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,680
After I injured Yuan Xing,

489
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I returned to the banquet hall

490
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,280
and saw that my comrades are all dead.

491
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,440
That was what happened.

492
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,720
That day, you said

493
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
that Yuan Xing had a servant with him

494
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
who took the lead a few times

495
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,800
in the fight.

496
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,680
Yes.

497
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,160
I got physical with them

498
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,360
because that guy provoked me.

499
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,040
Do you still remember
what he looked like?

500
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,040
Yes.

501
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,840
If I see him again,

502
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,520
I'll surely recognize him.

503
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,960
What's the matter?

504
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,720
That person...

505
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,920
That person looked like

506
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,080
Official Yan a bit.

507
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,800
However,

508
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,760
that guy has a beard.

509
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,040
I get it now.

510
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
Since you're saying

511
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,160
that he looked like Left Advisor,

512
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
let him put on a beard

513
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,480
and see.

514
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,160
Then

515
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,680
you can capture the person
based on what he looked like.

516
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,160
(His Majesty is on the verge
of life and death.)

517
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
(Yet Qiu Ziliang is just busy
with the investigation.)

518
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,080
(This won't do.)

519
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,480
(I have to find a way to end this soon.)

520
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,440
Official Shi.

521
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,000
Does he look like that person?

522
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,600
That's it.

523
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,560
He's the one!

524
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,800
That's right.

525
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
It's Yan Xiu.

526
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,320
I bought him off.

527
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,920
Punish him!

528
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,360
Central Commander Shi.

529
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
Look carefully.

530
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,520
Are you sure?

531
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,680
They look exactly alike.

532
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,160
I can't be wrong.

533
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,160
Even if they look exactly alike,

534
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,960
he might not necessarily
be Left Advisor.

535
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,360
You mean

536
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,280
that I'm intentionally
framing Official Yan?

537
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Father.

538
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,520
Please give me some time.

539
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Sure.

540
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,680
Follow me.

541
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,280
Come in.

542
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,200
Official Shi.

543
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,520
Among these four people,

544
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,840
which one was

545
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
the guard with a beard?

546
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,680
Well...

547
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,000
Well...

548
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,840
What's the matter?

549
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You can't recognize them now?

550
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,520
Didn't you say

551
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
that if you see him again,

552
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,200
you can surely recognize him?

553
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,200
Left Advisor has no feud with you.

554
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,360
Why do you want to harm him?

555
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
No.

556
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Speak.

557
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,520
Let them speak.

558
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,120
I remember that person's voice.

559
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,159
Once they speak,

560
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
I can tell.

561
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,880
Turn around, all of you.

562
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,520
What should they say?

563
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,159
At that time, that man yelled,

564
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,320
"How dare you hurt our General!

565
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Brothers, attack!"

566
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,560
Right.

567
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,800
Say it.

568
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,159
How dare you hurt our General!

569
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Brothers, attack!

570
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,560
How dare you hurt our General!

571
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,679
Brothers, attack!

572
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,400
How dare you hurt our General!

573
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,320
Brothers, attack!

574
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,159
The third one.

575
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,199
The third one's voice sounds like him.

576
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,320
Third person, turn around.

577
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,520
Fourth person, say it.

578
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,000
How dare you hurt our General!

579
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,360
Brothers, attack!

580
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,720
No.

581
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,760
The fourth person sounds like him.

582
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Sir, the fourth person sounds like him.

583
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,440
Fourth person, turn around.

584
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
Official Shi.

585
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,920
These two

586
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,400
were the ones you just identified.

587
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,360
Between the third and fourth one,

588
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,000
which one is it?

589
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,040
Father.

590
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,520
Basing it on the looks and voices

591
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,880
isn't enough to confirm this.

592
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm afraid that someone is intentionally
trying to frame Left Advisor,

593
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,000
so that you'd suspect him.

594
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,880
Sir.

595
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,320
When the incident happened,

596
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,920
I was practicing martial arts
in the camp.

597
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,640
The soldiers were all witnesses.

598
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,040
Please investigate clearly.

599
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,040
The soldiers

600
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,200
are all under your command.

601
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,640
Of course they'll be your witnesses!

602
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,240
Well...

603
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,160
Shut up!

604
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Central Commander Shi.

605
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Sir.

606
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,720
Were the beauty
and the gold from Cheng Xi

607
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
nice?

608
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,560
Sir.

609
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,560
No.

610
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
That's not true, Sir.

611
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
Your concubine already confessed.

612
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Cheng Xi was the one who gave her
to you, wasn't she?

613
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,240
In the past three years,

614
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,200
every year,

615
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,320
you received a box of gold.

616
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,000
Am I right?

617
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,960
I don't know anything about this, sir.

618
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,440
Sir, spare me!

619
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,520
Sir. You said...

620
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,200
You said that I could
make up for my crime

621
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
as long as I enter the palace
and assassinate His Majesty.

622
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,880
Sir.

623
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,840
You must be a man of your word!

624
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,400
Sir!

625
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,320
Sir!

626
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Sir!

627
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,640
Sir, spare me!

628
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,720
Sir!

629
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,160
Sir.

630
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,200
Central Commander Yuan is awake.

631
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,280
Yes.

632
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,520
His Majesty is stricken
with misfortunes.

633
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,600
He just got the military authority.

634
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,440
Yet he just enjoyed it
for a short time.

635
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,200
You tried everything.

636
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,520
In the end,

637
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,080
it's still up to me.

638
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,200
Guards!

639
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

640
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
Watch His Majesty well.

641
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,440
Without my permission,

642
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
no one can go near him.

643
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

644
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,680
What are you doing?

645
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,240
Your Majesty.

646
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,560
How bold! What are you doing?

647
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,200
- Uncle.
- Your Majesty!

648
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,880
- Uncle!
- Your Majesty!

649
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
- Your Majesty!
- Uncle.

650
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,720
Your Majesty!

651
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,600
Your Majesty.

652
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
We've been through

653
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,920
so much already.

654
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,760
We must hang on in this last hurdle.

655
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,120
Wake up.

656
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,200
You must wake up.

657
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
(Duke Chu's Residence)

658
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,360
Did you block Li Deyun already?

659
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,120
We've already sent soldiers

660
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,040
to trap him in the Study Room.

661
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,200
So,

662
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,920
even if he has 100,000 Shencai Army,

663
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,520
what's the use?

664
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,840
At the crucial moment, it's better

665
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,880
to let someone make a move secretly

666
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,200
to turn the situation around.

667
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,160
Father.

668
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,560
The Zhenwu Army is near.

669
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,240
If His Majesty dies now,

670
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,320
we'll be in big trouble.

671
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,760
So what if he dies?

672
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,640
Just seal the news.

673
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,560
Besides,

674
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
with the Crown Prince in our hands,

675
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,760
what are you afraid of?

676
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,240
Hang Shi Yuan's head outside.

677
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,120
Say that he assassinated His Majesty

678
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,560
and made him seriously injured
and difficult to heal.

679
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,000
Everything will depend on his fate.

680
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,800
Yes.

681
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,680
Your Majesty.

682
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,800
You're awake.

683
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,480
Did Qiu Ziliang

684
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,440
give you a hard time?

685
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,280
No.

686
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,880
But Uncle was captured.

687
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,560
Without Han Ding here,

688
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,360
I'm afraid that Li Deyun

689
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,280
won't be enough

690
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,720
to deal with Qiu Ziliang.

691
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,800
I

692
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,320
might really not survive this.

693
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,160
No.

694
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,680
We survived

695
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,080
so many times already.

696
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
We can surely get through this.

697
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,280
It's true.

698
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,880
I was careless,

699
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,400
and Qiu Ziliang was able
to overturn the situation.

700
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,560
It was my fault.

701
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,720
If you didn't try to save me,

702
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,720
you wouldn't get stabbed.

703
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,360
It was my fault.

704
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,080
Why are you crying?

705
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,960
It's nothing.

706
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,440
You helped me get

707
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,680
the Shencai Army's military authority,

708
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,560
and you're willing to die for me.

709
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,040
I got stabbed on your behalf.

710
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,320
We're even now.

711
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,200
How can my life

712
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,880
compare to yours?

713
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
It's fine even if I die.

714
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,120
If you die,

715
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,040
what will happen to Xing?

716
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,760
If that happens,

717
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,360
it's fate.

718
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,360
I did my best.

719
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,360
I believe that Qi Ang

720
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
and Teacher

721
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,560
wouldn't blame me too much.

722
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,440
Before I die,

723
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,320
there's something important

724
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,240
that I must do.

725
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,200
Guards.

726
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,560
Guards!

727
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,200
Yes.

728
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,040
It's you?

729
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,840
This is good too.

730
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,040
Go beside my table.

731
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,600
I'll dictate it,

732
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,040
and you write it.

733
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,440
Yes.

734
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,640
"Cheng Ruoyu

735
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,600
is well-mannered,

736
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,360
clever, and virtuous.

737
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,880
I like her very much.

738
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,120
She's appointed the title of Beauty

739
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
and given a thousand arces of farmland.

740
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,360
If something happens to me,

741
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,320
she's allowed

742
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,840
to return to her hometown and remarry.

743
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
