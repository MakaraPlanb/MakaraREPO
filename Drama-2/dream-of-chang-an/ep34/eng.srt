(I'm afraid I will be in trouble)

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,320
(if I don't go
on a retreat and meditate.)

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
(But with the current situation,)

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,040
(there's no way for me)

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
(to meditate in peace.)

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,960
(Who is the one)

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
(behind this mutiny?)

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
(What is their goal?)

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,800
(Who is behind this?)

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,920
(No matter who you are,)

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,880
(I will surely)

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,800
(find you.)

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
I have something to say.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I don't know if I should tell you.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Speak.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,880
In my opinion,

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
when both sides are equal,

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
strategies are important.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
But if it's a one-sided fight,

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,400
we may lay waste to them immediately.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,040
To Official Qiu,

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
today's mutiny

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
and other tricks we have against him

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
are nothing.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,720
Actually,

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
it was the same for

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,080
the Morning Dew Rebellion.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
There were plenty of soldiers
lying in waiting for him.

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,000
In the end,

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
no one was able to defeat him.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,880
Are you saying that we need to
disable Qiu Ziliang's power

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,040
before we can defeat him?

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,280
It would've been great if I wasn't

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,960
struck by the arrow back then.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,680
I didn't expect us

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
to lose because of this.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,240
It's because of my incompetence.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Although I know martial arts,

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,520
I haven't made great progress.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,040
Even now,

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm still a mediocre martial artist.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,920
Yan Xiu,

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,920
who is the most talented

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,120
martial artist you've ever met?

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,280
The most talented martial artist?

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,360
Who is it?

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Little Fish.

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,960
This is bad.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,680
Her martial arts?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,560
Wait.

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,640
Little Fish's martial arts
have been restored.

66
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm sure Eunuch Qiu
will pursue her because of this.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Someone!

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,880
Someone!

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,080
Someone!

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,000
Let me out!

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
I have something to say!

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Someone!

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Someone!

74
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Someone!

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,640
Someone!

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,600
Is anyone out there?

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
I don't know what Commander's Seal
you are talking about.

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,880
Duke Chu, although
you're an important official,

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,840
you can't just ignore the law

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,880
and malign me for something

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
that I've never done.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,120
Tell me.

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,920
Which spies of yours

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
are serving me right now?

85
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
You went through brutal torture.

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,880
Yet you've fully recovered
within two months.

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Right Advisor,

88
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,760
don't tell me you went easy on her?

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,400
I don't dare to do so.

90
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
Is that so?

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,240
If so,

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
tell me then.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
How did your crushed bones

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,600
manage to grow back by themselves?

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,160
Just ignore her.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
She was looking for her death.

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
Just like what you said.

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,760
A bad move.

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,880
You're right.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,480
Her life and death

101
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
have nothing to do with me.

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
You should use this time

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,200
to come up with a way

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
to obtain Shencai Army's command.

105
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,240
Yanzhi,

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
don't hesitate.

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,160
Don't be soft-hearted.

108
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Don't interfere,

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
and don't save her.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,880
Why are you here?

111
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,200
Under the Grand Empress Dowager's order,

112
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm here to send His Majesty
some oranges.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Official Qiu has given us instructions.

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
Without his permission,

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
no one is allowed

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
to send anything to him.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,840
Return now.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,920
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,200
(This is great.)

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840
(Seems like)

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,480
(Li Deyun has obtained
the Commander's Seal.)

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
(Next,)

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,880
(it's Yu'er's turn.)

124
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,580
(Chess Ancestor Shennong)

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
What about Li Deyun?

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,200
There are no discoveries for now.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Keep a close eye on Li Zening.

128
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Understood.

129
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
It's fine if you don't want to speak.

130
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
We can stay here all day.

131
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
I told you I took the medicine.

132
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
You didn't believe me.

133
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,600
I told you I was talented
at martial arts.

134
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
You didn't believe me either.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,680
What would you like me to say?

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,320
Do you want me

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
to tell you that someone broke my limbs

138
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
on purpose

139
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
in order to make me healthy?

140
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,840
Who was the one who had betrayed me?

141
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,040
It's her.

142
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,440
I don't dare to do so.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
It's him.

144
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,600
I don't dare to do so.

145
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,720
It's him.

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't dare to do so.

147
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
It's them!

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
We don't dare to do so.

149
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,920
You're just a eunuch.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,880
The people have never been
satisfied with your rule.

151
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
Do you really think

152
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,880
that your followers are loyal to you?

153
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,800
Today,

154
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,880
if you don't tell me the truth,

155
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,960
I will make you suffer a fate
worse than death.

156
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Sir,

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
His Majesty is dying.

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,240
Right Advisor.

159
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Stay here.

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Keep an eye on her.

162
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,919
Yes, sir.

163
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,440
Did Qiu Ziliang enter the palace?

164
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Where are you going?

165
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,960
To save someone.

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
What?

167
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
Didn't you say you won't meddle with

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,840
Little Fish's affair anymore?

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Ever since I made that decision,

170
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
my heart felt uneasy.

171
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,560
Now,

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
I can finally have some relief.

173
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
Sorry.

174
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
Sorry for implicating you.

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
Your savior is here.

176
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Are you okay?

177
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,880
I'm fine.

178
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,360
This is just the start.

179
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
When Father returns,

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,880
you'll suffer even more.

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Isn't that the reason

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
you're here to save me?

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,040
You're really confident in yourself.

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,280
What makes you think that
I will save you?

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Because

186
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
you want to be the empress.

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
I don't need you to be the empress.

188
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,400
And

189
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
without a rival like you,

190
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Qi Yan will be able
to accept me more easily.

191
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
That's why I'm going to tell you
the same thing.

192
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,560
I won't save you unless you work for me.

193
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,880
You know that's impossible.

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,880
Yu'er,

195
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,840
promise me.

196
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,920
This way,

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Qi Yan will be able to win,

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,400
and you may survive.

199
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,480
And I

200
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
will have a valid reason to save you.

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
If you promise me this,

202
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,840
you may still get to
be together with Qi Yan in the future.

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
There's no need for you

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
to reject your only way
out of this mess.

205
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,120
I will never lie to you.

206
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Although you're Qiu Ziliang's daughter,

207
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
I know you're not a crook.

208
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,440
Although you've committed

209
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,760
a lot of mistakes because of him,

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,280
I know

211
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,640
that you're kind at heart.

212
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't know what's your goal,

213
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
but you have saved

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,160
His Majesty time and time again.

215
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,440
That is the truth.

216
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Yanzhi,

217
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,800
I already treated you
as my friend long ago.

218
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,640
I will never lie to you.

219
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,400
Is Qi Yan that good of a person?

220
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,560
Him?

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,720
He's a bad person.

222
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
He's extremely arrogant.

223
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,800
He's not tactful enough.

224
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
And he harbours

225
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,680
ambitions that are out of his league.

226
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,280
He has been trying his best to act like

227
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,240
an incompetent ruler

228
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,720
with a eunuch as his father.

229
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,120
But he's unable

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
to deal with someone courteously
without sincerity.

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
A person like him

232
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,840
is the worst.

233
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,600
But he's the kind of person

234
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,480
I want to protect the most.

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
Even if I have to face
numerous obstacles

236
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
and ordeals because of him,

237
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,160
I wish to walk in the same path as him.

238
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
I, Cheng Ruoyu,

239
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
will never abandon His Majesty.

240
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,920
Yanzhi,

241
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,160
If that's the case,

243
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
only death awaits.

244
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,400
You will die.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
He will die as well.

246
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,400
I

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
have never regretted my decision.

248
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,920
(Grandfather,)

249
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,520
(Cheng Ruoyu is just like you.)

250
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,200
(Is it because)

251
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
(her personality is the same as yours?)

252
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,240
(Is that why)

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,960
(I can't bear)

254
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,400
(to abandon a person like her?)

255
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,120
Later, Xiu will release you.

256
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
You better come up with a way

257
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,400
to cure your hand.

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
So, you...

259
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,520
We are friends,

260
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
am I right?

261
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Yes.

262
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
We are friends.

263
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,960
Sir,

264
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
we found out

265
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,200
who had been helping Cheng Ruoyu

266
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,320
all along.

267
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
Sir, you were right.

268
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
I understand.

269
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
You may leave.

270
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,960
Yes, sir.

271
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,680
(I've saved her.)

272
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,120
(So, why do I still feel uneasy?)

273
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,240
(Strange.)

274
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
If Qiu Ziliang realised

275
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
that Cheng Ruoyu was able to recover
at a rapid pace

276
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
after the brutal torture,

277
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm sure he will be suspicious
of Right Advisor.

278
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,280
And with his paranoid personality,

279
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
he won't let her off.

280
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
But he still ordered Right Advisor
to keep an eye on her?

281
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,800
This is bad.

282
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,080
I fell for his plot.

283
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,720
I need to notify Xiu immediately.

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Why are you...

285
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Where did you go?

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,800
I've been looking for you.

287
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,760
Father.

288
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,920
Father, why are you here

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
at this hour of the night?

290
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,240
Don't tell me

291
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
you don't know what's going on?

292
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,280
Xiu,

293
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
what do you mean by this?

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
Why did you bring
Cheng Ruoyu back with you?

295
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
Chess Oversees, please forgive me.

296
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
I was bribed by Little Fish.

297
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,160
She wanted me to bring her to the palace

298
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,800
to see His Majesty one last time.

299
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
And Official Qiu caught me red-handed.

300
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
I was bewitched

301
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,520
as I was planning to accept her bribe.

302
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,079
Sir, Chess Overseer, please punish me.

303
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,720
This is interesting.

304
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,640
She was stripped of her position.
Now, she's just an ordinary person.

305
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
What can she provide you with?

306
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I would like

307
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,840
to hear about it.

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,480
It's the secret arts of
the Violet Bureau.

309
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,600
Little Fish's martial arts
have improved tremendously.

310
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
She was able to recover at a rapid pace

311
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,200
even after experiencing brutal torture.

312
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,520
I have made no progress

313
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,560
in martial arts for a long time.

314
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,480
That's why I asked her about her secret.

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,480
She told me

316
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,760
that as long as I let her

317
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,080
see His Majesty one last time,

318
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
she'll teach me the secret arts.

319
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,440
Sir, Chess Overseer, please punish me.

320
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,800
Sir, please forgive me!

321
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
Yanzhi,

322
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
do you believe in

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,880
the Left Advisor's words?

324
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,640
Father,

325
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
Left Advisor must've made such a mistake

326
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
because his mind
was befuddled temporarily.

327
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,720
You have a point.

328
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,000
If secret arts like that do exist,

329
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,480
I would've been attracted by her offer.

330
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
But

331
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,000
he has betrayed his organisation

332
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,440
and he tried to oppose us in private.

333
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,920
What do you think
his punishment should be?

334
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,720
To be executed without mercy.

335
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,880
What are you waiting for?

336
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
Do it.

337
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
He's your subordinate.

338
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,680
You will do it yourself.

339
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
I'm able to die
at the hands of the Chess Overseer.

340
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,040
I, Yan Xiu,

341
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
have no regrets in life.

342
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Great job.

343
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,120
Qiu Ziliang,

344
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
I've bribed every single one

345
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,240
of your soldiers.

346
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,440
Why don't you kill all of them?

347
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,960
It'll make me happier.

348
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,560
Little Fish, shut up.

349
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,120
Father,

350
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,240
Xiu has been following you
for many years.

351
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,320
He has rendered great merits.

352
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
Father, please let him off

353
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
on account of what he has done for us.

354
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
Every soldier in
the Chess of Generals Camp

355
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,360
with a rank higher than Pawn

356
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,000
has rendered great merits
for the organisation.

357
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
All of them have risked their lives
for the organisation.

358
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,800
If I do let him off,

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
not only will my authority
be questioned,

360
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,760
your authority
will be questioned as well.

361
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
Xiu is different from others.

362
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
He saved me before.

363
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,680
Father,

364
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,560
I beg you.

365
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Please let him atone for his crimes.

366
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,320
As the Chess Overseer,

367
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,400
you're being soft-hearted right now.

368
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,840
This isn't like you at all.

369
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,680
Since that's the case,

370
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,240
you may rise.

371
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,920
I will give him another chance.

372
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,200
But

373
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,040
evil-doer

374
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,720
must not be forgiven.

375
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,760
Yanzhi,

376
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,440
end her life.

377
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,440
What?

378
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,200
Don't tell me you can't
bear to kill her as well?

379
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,760
It's not that.

380
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,200
I have another use for her.

381
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
I don't need her.

382
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,480
But

383
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
Qi Yan isn't dead yet.

384
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,720
Father, you can use her
to restrict Qi Yan.

385
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
Qi Yan

386
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,200
is completely under my control!

387
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
This Little Fish.

388
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,000
She always spoils my plan.

389
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,880
Between the Left Advisor and her,

390
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,800
you can only choose one of them.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,680
Yes, Father.

392
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,640
Father,

393
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,920
please allow me to retrieve my ring.

394
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,840
I will wait for you.

395
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,640
(Virtuous and prestigious)

396
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,400
(Calm down.)

397
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,200
(Calm down.)

398
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,160
(The more critical the situation is,)

399
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
(the more I need to calm down.)

400
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,400
(What should I do?)

401
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
(I can't just abandon Xiu.)

402
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,480
(But Yu'er...)

403
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,400
(Don't tell me I need)

404
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,440
(to kill her to protect myself?)

405
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,240
(I have no choice.)

406
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,880
(This is the only way.)

407
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,680
(If I don't kill her,)

408
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,520
(not only will Xiu die,)

409
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,280
(Qiu Ziliang will start
to suspect me as well.)

410
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
(Qiu Ziliang was testing me out.)

411
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,160
(He's doing this on purpose.)

412
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,680
(This is the only way.)

413
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,000
(I'm sorry.)

414
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,640
This is too painful.

415
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,960
This is too bitter.

416
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,720
This will cause her a terrible death.

417
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't wish to kill anyone.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,160
I don't want to kill anyone.

419
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,120
I don't want to kill Cheng Ruoyu!

420
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,680
I can't continue with my act anymore.

421
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
Eight years.

422
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,400
I've endured this for eight years

423
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,800
before I come to where I am.

424
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Am I going to give up right now?

425
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,520
No.

426
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
I mustn't give up.

427
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm the last surviving kin
of the Wang family.

428
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,680
I mustn't give up!

429
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Cheng Ruoyu,

430
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
sorry about this.

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,240
If we meet each other in the underworld,

432
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,840
I will let you do
whatever you want to me.

433
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,520
(Today,)

434
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
(you and I,)

435
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,560
(one of us will die.)

436
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,280
Someone.

437
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,320
Yes, sir.

438
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
Go and check on Yanzhi.

439
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Find out why she's taking so long.

440
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yes, sir.

441
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,320
I have something to tell you.

442
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
You can tell me next time.

443
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,560
You mustn't kill Yu'er.

444
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,000
If she doesn't die,

445
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,720
Xiu will die.

446
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,240
I can't afford to lose Xiu

447
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,600
because of Yu'er.

448
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
Yanzhi!

449
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,400
Let go of me.

450
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,000
Let go!

451
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
Let go of me!

452
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
Listen,

453
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,720
you must never kill Yu'er.

454
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,080
I have no other choice.

455
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
You do have a choice.

456
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
Don't you understand?

457
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,240
Qiu Ziliang wasn't suspicious of Xiu.

458
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,680
He was suspicious of me!

459
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,240
He knew that I was the one
who had released Yu'er.

460
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,480
That's why he wants me
to kill her personally,

461
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
so that I can stop resisting

462
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,920
and serve him

463
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,280
with all my heart.

464
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,040
That's his true goal.

465
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,160
I know that.

466
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,480
If Cheng Ruoyu doesn't die,

467
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
that means I have to die.

468
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,160
Don't you care about my life?

469
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,600
It's precisely
because I care for your life

470
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,160
that I'm stopping you from killing her.

471
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,120
In this world,

472
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,280
you can kill anyone you like,

473
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,840
including me.

474
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,320
But you must

475
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,960
never kill Yu'er.

476
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,120
Give me a reason.

477
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,960
If you don't give me a reason,

478
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,800
she will die today.

479
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,000
She's Wang Ruoling.

480
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,320
What did you say?

481
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,560
Cheng Ruoyu

482
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,080
is your younger sister,

483
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,560
Wang Ruoling.

484
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,920
This is impossible.

485
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,320
This is impossible.

486
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Ruoling is dead.

487
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
You're lying to me.

488
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,080
It's impossible for Cheng Ruoyu
to be Ruoling.

489
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,000
That's impossible!

490
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I've been hiding this secret

491
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,880
for many years.

492
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,760
(Chess Ancestor Shennong)

493
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,080
Your Highness,

494
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,840
it's Wang Ruoling.

495
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,600
She's alive.

496
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,640
You weren't around

497
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
when I found her.

498
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
Moreover, Yu'er

499
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,840
was barely alive back then.

500
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
I needed to save her.

501
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,120
That's why I stopped searching for you
temporarily.

502
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
Bring her back to treat her.

503
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,320
Her condition only got better
after half a year.

504
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
She also lost all of her memories

505
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,240
because of that incident.

506
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,520
In order to conceal her identity,

507
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
I let Cheng Xi took her in.

508
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,280
She changed her name to Cheng Ruoyu

509
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,440
and brought her into the Violet Bureau.

510
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,920
But I didn't expect

511
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,720
Cheng Xi

512
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,320
to lead her to His Majesty's side.

513
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,280
Chess Overseer, please hurry.

514
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,800
Official Qiu is running out of patience.

515
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,240
Why are you only telling me this by now?

516
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,080
Why are you only telling me this by now?

517
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,840
Yu'er and His Majesty

518
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
are close with each other.

519
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
If I let Yu'er know that

520
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
His Majesty was the one

521
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,640
who shot you two

522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
and your grandfather, I'm afraid...

523
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
So, this is what Cheng Xi meant

524
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,160
by the heartbreaking truth.

525
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,840
Chess Overseer, please hurry.

526
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
What should I do?

527
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,960
What should I do?

528
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,680
Do you still wish to kill her?

529
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,520
She's my younger sister!

530
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
I would rather die

531
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,360
than to hurt her!

532
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,160
That's right.

533
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,480
I can die on behalf of her.

534
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,360
Let go of me.

535
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,360
I need to save Ruoling.

536
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,160
Yanzhi!

537
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,000
Listen to me.

538
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,920
How are you going to save her?

539
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,200
Look at you. You're full of tears.

540
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,160
You look distracted.

541
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,000
How are you going to save her
from Qiu Ziliang's clutch?

542
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,000
There's no need to save her.

543
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,840
You need to kill her.

544
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,639
Father, I was suffering from a relapse.

545
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
That's why I was late.

546
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,320
Father, please forgive me.

547
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,120
Have you taken your medicine?

548
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,159
I have.

549
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm fine now.

550
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,880
You may begin then.

551
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,600
This is great.

552
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,720
It doesn't hurt at all.

553
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,880
Yanzhi,

554
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
promise me one thing.

555
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,120
What is it?

556
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,600
Bring my body back to the palace.

557
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
I want to see His Majesty...

and you've created
plenty of trouble for us.

Cheng Ruoyu is dead.

581

Father, please examine her body.

582
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
She deserves this fate!

583
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,320
Father,

584
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,920
what should we do with her body then?

585
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,160
Do we send it to Qi Yan?

586
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,760
Send it to Qi Yan?

587
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,920
Why should we do so?

588
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Dump her into the mass grave.

589
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,760
Reporting in!

590
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,040
Sir!

591
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,840
Speak.

592
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,800
This is bad.

593
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
We've received news from the palace.

594
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,600
His Majesty

595
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,800
won't be able to live for long.

596
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
His Majesty's wound is worsening.

597
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,080
He's losing a huge amount of blood.

598
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,560
Even the imperial physicians
can't do anything about it.

599
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
Sir.

600
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,720
Go.

601
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Bring Prince Guang here.

602
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes, sir.

603
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,560
Father, you plan to help
Prince Guang ascend the throne?

604
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,880
I thought

605
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
you always hated him?

606
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,480
Time has changed.

607
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,000
We'll put him within
the Chess of Generals Camp for now.

608
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,520
Yes, Father.

609
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,040
Yanzhi,

610
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,760
come here.

611
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,160
Closer.

612
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,520
You're the person closest to me.

613
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,520
That means

614
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,280
you're only able to harm me

615
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
because I gave you the right to do so.

616
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,640
Do not disappoint me.

617
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,040
Yes, Father.

618
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,440
The rest of you,

619
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,040
brew the medicine
according to this prescription.

620
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,080
His Majesty may barely survive
if he drinks it.

621
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,000
If His Majesty doesn't drink it,

622
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,000
he will die.

623
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,680
Hurry.

624
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,360
Yes, sir.

625
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,880
Your Majesty.

626
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,160
Your Majesty.

627
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,760
Sir,

628
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
we need to make plans

629
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,160
regarding the next crown prince sooner.

630
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,320
Do you want me to select another
disobedient crown prince

631
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,400
so that he can distract me

632
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
while the rest of you can continue
to gain profit

633
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
from the situation,

634
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,440
am I right?

635
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,080
All of you are something else.

636
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,400
How dare you guys
steal the special military pay

637
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,640
that I've rewarded to them?

638
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Sir, we are innocent!

639
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,520
No matter how brave we are,

640
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,040
we will never have the guts
to disobey you.

641
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,000
Scram!

642
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,640
Never appear in front of me again!

643
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,440
Scram!

644
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,760
Come back.

645
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,400
Seal off this place.

646
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,560
Do not let anyone know
what's happening inside.

647
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,880
Yes, sir.
