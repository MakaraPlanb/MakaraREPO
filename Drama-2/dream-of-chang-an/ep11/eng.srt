- Yes.
- Yes.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,480
What are you up to again?

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,920
You saved me again.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,200
Remember to repay me.

19
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,160
Yes.

20
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,320
(Xia Ziyuan.)

21
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Madam.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,280
What happened?

23
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Yu'er is back.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Those from Yuzhen Hall

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
also left safely

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
and changed their route to Jinyang.

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,840
They're preparing to blend

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
into Princess Ninghe's entourage

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,880
and return to Heng'an.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,480
That's a good idea.

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
However,

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
will Qiu Ziliang let Princess Ninghe

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
come back alive?

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,200
If Ninghe dies,

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,080
everyone around her

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,520
might sentenced to death
because they didn't

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,120
protect her well.

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Right.

39
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
We must still find a way

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,440
to keep Princess Ninghe alive.

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
If we have no other choice,

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,960
we can only let Qiu Yanzhi know

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,080
that the mastermind behind Zheng Wu

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,760
is Ninghe.

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,080
This way,

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,440
won't Qiu Ziliang

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,840
hate Princess Ninghe more?

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
If Qiu Ziliang hates someone,

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,800
that person can live longer.

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
30 soldiers arrived in Jinyang.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
According to your instructions,

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
they prepared to capture Ninghe
and bring her back to the capital.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
But after they entered the relay station,

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
they never came out again.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,880
There was no trace of a fight

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,680
and no corpses.

57
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,560
Without the guards

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,800
in the relay station knowing,

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
the 30 soldiers

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,520
just disappeared.

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,120
Did you investigate?

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Using theft as an excuse,

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,960
I asked the government office there
to perform a search.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
They didn't find anyone.

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,080
Also,

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,960
we even tested the regional governor
of Zhenwu.

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,360
we noticed that they have
good martial arts skills.

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Especially Princess Misha.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
She's a martial arts expert.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
It's not strange for a regional governor
to know martial arts.

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
But it's not that simple

72
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,640
for a princess to be
a martial arts expert.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
This is Zu Qi.

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
He's good in imitation.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
Demonstrate to us

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
the three moves you used

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,600
to test Princess Misha back then.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes.

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,640
Go and investigate

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
Ninghe's relationship with her

81
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,840
before she got married.

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Yu'er.

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,360
Apply it once a day.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
After seven consecutive days,

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
the wound should be healed.

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
Your Highness doesn't have
any ready-made medicines?

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,760
Duke Chu prohibits me
from touching herbs again.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Why?

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I think

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,880
he wants me

91
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
to focus on being an idle prince.

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,360
He interferes so much.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
Don't worry, Your Highness.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Someday,

95
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,240
we won't

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
be threatened by that man again.

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920
Yuan Du

98
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
told me all about what you did.

99
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Well done.

100
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,800
By the way,

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,880
I forgot to thank you

103
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
for the sachet you gave me.

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
However,

105
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,920
Qiu Yanzhi took it.

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
You met Yanzhi?

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,480
She asked me

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,200
what Zuo Ma gave me.

109
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
She looked very anxious.

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,400
But I really don't know

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240
what it is.

112
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,360
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

114
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,400
Han Yue

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,880
was the late emperor's Left
General-in-Chief of the Jinwu Guards

116
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
when he was still alive.

117
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,840
In the earlier years,

118
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
he once became Ninghe's personal guard.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
Misha's using the martial arts

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
that he practiced?

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,360
Yes.

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
All signs indicate

123
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,440
that the mastermind

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,600
behind Zheng Wu

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,200
and the assassins

126
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
is Ninghe.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
Her motive and capability

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
match your speculations.

129
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
I can't forgive her.

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,200
Especially

131
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
since she even passed on
General Han's martial arts

132
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,360
to an outsider.

133
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Fine.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
If she wants to come home,

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
capture her and bring her back.

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,400
Let her see

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
how many stupid things
she has done.

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
But Official Qiu wants her dead.

139
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
If Father finds out about these things,

140
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
he won't want her to die.

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
He'll want her to wish
that she were dead.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
Your Majesty wants

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,640
to ask me something?

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,400
Is it regarding the sachet?

145
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
How can you know

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,040
the way to break Yuzhen's formation?

147
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,000
And how did you know

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
that Madam Jade has a throat disease?

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
Miss.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Can you

151
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,400
answer these questions for me?

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
Ms. Ziyuan.

153
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,919
Do you know me?

154
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
In Hall Leader's room,

155
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,640
there was a portrait of you,

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
so I know you.

157
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,159
Why did she paint my portrait?

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,680
Four years ago,

159
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,760
after you saved her life,

160
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
she has always been grateful to you

161
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,160
and admired you.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,560
It turns out that you saved
Madam Jade before.

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Four years ago,

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
when Madam Jade temporarily stayed
at Cai's Wine Shop,

165
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
she was almost raped,

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,760
and her throat was slit.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
Ordinary doctors couldn't treat her,

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,360
so Cheng Xi brought her to me.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
Even if the wound healed,

170
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,640
her vocal chords can't be restored.

171
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,840
I was distrustful.

172
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,880
Please don't take it to heart.

173
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Your Majesty.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,520
Uncle.

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Rise.

176
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,320
Actually,

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
I've long known

178
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
about Yuzhen Hall,

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,920
yet I never told you about it.

180
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
I feel very guilty.

181
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
It's all because I promised
the late emperor

182
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,120
that I won't tell anyone about it.

183
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,280
That's why...

184
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,600
I know that you had your reasons.

185
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,640
I only feel gratitude towards you.

186
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,640
Your Highness.

187
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,600
Regarding the last sachet

188
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
that you gave me,

189
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,080
"Two Children's Debate",

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
does it mean

191
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
that I must bring
the recalcitrant person

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
back to HIs Majesty?

193
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
Did I understand it correctly?

195
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
"Two Children's Debate".

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,880
Even sages don't know certain things.

197
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,680
I couldn't think of anything else.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,520
I wanted you to explore on your own.

199
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,600
It seems like

200
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,760
she did well.

201
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,600
Why are you laughing?

202
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,960
Your Highness.

203
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,360
Your Majesty.

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Your Highness.

205
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,920
Qiu Ziliang is urgently mobilizing

206
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
3,000 troops from the Shengcai Army

207
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,000
to go to Jinyang
and pick Princess Ninghe up.

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
Prior to this, Qiu Yanzhi

209
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,680
once sent a portion of the troops

210
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,440
to Jinyang.

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,880
What's strange

212
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,880
is that after the soldiers went inside
the relay station,

213
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
they disappeared.

214
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,400
The Chess of Generals Camp's soldiers

215
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,800
have good martial arts skills.

216
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
How can they disappear for no reason?

217
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
It seemed to be Zhengwu's
regional governors' doing.

218
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
Their martial arts skills

219
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,600
are so good

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,760
that they can kill those soldiers

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
without anyone knowing?

222
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,440
They might not have necessarily used
martial arts.

223
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,200
A pot of rosa rubus

224
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
can do the trick too.

225
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,360
Aunt Ninghe has that plant?

226
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,160
Rosa rubus is very hard to grow,

227
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,240
not to mention

228
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
that Zhenwu is a desolate
and cold place.

229
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,240
It will die once it leaves the soil.

230
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,440
Your Highness.

231
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,920
Where's the one in your room?

232
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,080
It's with Qiu Yanzhi.

233
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Of course Qiu Yanzhi

234
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,720
won't use it

235
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
against her own soldiers.

236
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
So the problem

237
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,560
lies

238
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
in Zhengwu's regional governors.

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
I find it strange

240
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
that Qiu Ziliang

241
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,720
sent the Shencai to pick her up.

242
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
If he wants Ninghe to die,

243
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
he doesn't need to make such a ruckus.

244
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
Perhaps he already knows

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
that the 300 people from Yuzhen Hall

246
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
will take the opportunity
to return to the capital.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
That's a possibility.

248
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,200
Another possibility

249
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
is that he doesn't want anything
to happen to Ninghe.

250
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,440
How is that possible?

251
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
All he wants

252
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,160
is for Princess Ninghe to die.

253
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,720
Cheng Xi would like to request
His Highness Prince Guang's audience.

254
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
I acted on my own.

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
Your Majesty, please punish me.

256
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
You said

257
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,840
that you intentionally
leaked out information

258
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
about Madam Hong to the Chess
of Generals Camp?

259
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I heard that Qiu Yanzhi

260
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
sent people to investigate Ninghe,

261
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,880
so I planted

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,040
related evidence.

263
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Why did you do that?

264
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,080
Your Majesty.

265
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,440
Princess Ninghe has evil intentions
towards you.

266
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
She's coming back this time
to seek revenge.

267
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
That's why you made a move first

268
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
to let Qiu Ziliang deal with her.

269
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
I did it to protect you

270
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,240
and also to let

271
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
Yuzhen Hall's 300 members

272
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,080
come back smoothly

273
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,280
to assist you.

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,880
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

275
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
Very good.

276
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Cheng Xi.

277
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,040
You're great.

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,760
You made a mistake.

279
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,360
Your Majesty.

280
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,720
You were only thinking

281
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
about how to protect Yuzhen Hall.

282
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,280
Did you ever consider
what will happen to Ninghe?

283
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,840
She was supposed to die.

284
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,400
Now, Qiu Ziliang

285
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,160
won't kill her

286
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
and will keep her alive instead.

287
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,040
He'll keep her alive
to experience torment?

288
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
She deserves it.

289
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
She's my sister.

290
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,440
She's also His Majesty's aunt.

291
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,160
Cheng Xi.

292
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm afraid that His Majesty

293
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,240
won't let you work for him again.

294
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,040
Your Majesty.

295
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,440
I'm seeking punishment on Aunt's behalf.

296
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,200
Even if Aunt did it for Your Majesty

297
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,640
and Violet Bureau's sakes,

298
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,440
she was wrong.

299
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,480
Aren't you siding with your relative
instead of reason then?

300
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes.

301
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,280
That's why I'm willing to be punished
on Aunt's behalf.

302
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,000
However, Your Majesty,

303
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Princess' life is in danger now.

304
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Can we discuss this

305
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
after I save her?

306
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,760
You want to save her?

307
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,400
You're the one who wants to save her,

308
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,200
don't you?

309
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,440
Your Majesty.

310
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,360
We have 300 people now.

311
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
The Zhengwu regional governors
have great martial arts skills.

312
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,360
The Chess of Generals Camp
can't do anything to them.

313
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,280
The Shencai Army

314
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,680
must still obey imperial decrees
on the surface.

315
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,360
The current situation is beneficial

316
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
to us.

317
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,560
But I don't want to save Ninghe either.

318
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
She's wicked,

319
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,840
and she's forcing me

320
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,560
and Qiu Ziliang to kill each other.

321
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,080
Returning to the capital

322
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,080
is just

323
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,600
a part of her plan.

324
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Then we must save her all the more

325
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,480
and crush her conspiracy.

326
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,760
Why do you trust me so much?

327
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,280
Perhaps I'm a bad person.

328
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,080
I'm guilty.

329
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,960
I probably deserve to be assassinated

330
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,480
and to be taken revenge against,

331
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,680
Your Majesty.

332
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
I don't know

333
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,480
who you were before.

334
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
But to me,

335
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
who you are now is a good person.

336
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm definitely not a good person.

337
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,160
However,

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,200
I definitely won't let you regret

339
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,560
following me.

340
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Since you became Chess Overseer,

341
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,640
you never served me again.

342
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
I'm unfilial.

343
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,440
I'll often visit you in the future.

344
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,600
I

345
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,160
lent you the Shencai Army

346
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,120
hoping that you can
make good use of them.

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Don't worry, Father.

348
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
I definitely won't repeat

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
the mistake I made with Yuzhen Hall.

350
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Are you sure that Ninghe

351
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,680
is the mastermind behind all of these?

352
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Yes.

353
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,840
Especially regarding Yuzhen Hall.

354
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,120
She misled all of us.

355
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,120
Sir.

356
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,360
The sword found in Yuzhen Hall

357
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,840
was a stocked item

358
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
for Zhennan regional governor
Qi Qing's rebellion

359
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,240
30 years ago.

360
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,160
But it was never used.

361
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,720
It just remained there.

362
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,520
What about the Bagua mechanism?

363
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,520
Is it the same?

364
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,800
Yes.

365
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
The black iron used by the mechanism

366
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,760
is the same as the sword.

367
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,880
That means

368
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,280
Yuzhen Hall actually belonged
to Qi Qing?

369
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,200
That's right.

370
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
Qi Qing has been dead for 30 years.

371
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,360
No one was there anymore.

372
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
If it's really Violet Bureau's turf,

373
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
there's no reason for Qi Yan

374
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,080
and Cheng Ruoyu not to know about it.

375
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,560
Later on, we followed the clues

376
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,800
and went to Mount Qi.

377
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,200
There,

378
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,680
we met Cheng Ruoyu, who was also there

379
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
to investigate this matter.

380
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,760
All clues are pointing to Ninghe.

381
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
And the blowfish poison

382
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,760
on Zheng Wu's needle

383
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,160
also announced Ninghe's intention.

384
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
She wants to seek revenge
for the late emperor.

385
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,320
She wants revenge?

386
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,960
Great.

387
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,640
It's been 15 years.

388
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,840
I haven't done anything to her.

389
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
As for her,

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,880
she's making moves against me.

391
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,840
When will she arrive?

392
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,160
If everything goes as planned,

393
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,160
after three days.

394
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,360
It seems like

395
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,280
we must entertain

396
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
this old friend well.

397
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,400
What's this?

398
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,440
Isn't this yours?

399
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,040
When I went to Mount Qi before,

400
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,360
it was in this bag.

401
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,720
I never left anything

402
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,760
in this bag.

403
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,760
Was this what Qiu Yanzhi

404
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,440
wanted me to give to her?

405
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,640
But nothing is written here.

406
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,880
Stop it.

407
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,480
You've been used.

408
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,920
What do you mean?

409
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Internal conflict
in the Chess of Generals Camp.

410
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,640
Zuo Ma planted this to frame you,

411
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,320
and Qiu Yanzhi chased after you.

412
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,640
The real thing

413
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
is in their hands.

414
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,920
My goodness.

415
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
They all

416
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
treat me as a foolish person
they can blame.

417
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,280
Why are you laughing?

418
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Are you afraid of going against

419
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,320
an incredible enemy like Qiu Yanzhi now?

420
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,240
Afraid?

421
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,080
That word doesn't exist

422
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
in my dictionary.

423
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
However,

424
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
Qiu Yanzhi really gives me

425
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
a strange feeling.

426
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,960
If you say that she's a good person,

427
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,240
she did many bad things.

428
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
But if you say that she's a bad person,

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
in secret, she repeatedly...

430
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,040
She helped us.

431
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,360
What is she after?

432
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,360
If you want to know,

433
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,520
continue the plan to sow discord
among the enemy.

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,520
Give her what you have.

435
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,560
What if she doesn't believe me?

436
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
She will.

437
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,440
Cheng Ruoyu.

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,920
As long as you're willing,

439
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,480
everyone in this world

440
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
will trust you.

441
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Me too.

442
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,640
I hope that you have

443
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,800
a good enough reason

444
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
to let me forgive you

445
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
for repeatedly sneaking
into Chess of Generals Camp.

446
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,080
If I were you,

447
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,640
I'd blame myself

448
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,320
for the lax security

449
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,960
in Chess of Generals Camp.

450
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,440
This person

451
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,520
kept following your horse carriage.

452
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,560
I don't know how long
he had been eavesdropping.

453
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,720
It seems like not only does
the Chess of Generals Camp

454
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,120
have lax security,

455
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,600
the people are not united too.

456
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,200
You went to Mount Qi

457
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,680
just for that

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
and even fought with me?

459
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,280
Qiu Yanzhi.

460
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
It seems like you're not that smart too.

461
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,200
What do you want to exchange it for?

462
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,640
Qiu Yanzhi has a suspicious nature.

463
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,360
She's almost exactly the same

464
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,400
as her godfather Qiu Ziliang.

465
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,040
What should I do then?

466
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,280
Instead of thinking

467
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,800
about making up a lie

468
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,640
to let her believe you,

469
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,000
just tell her your condition.

470
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,600
Yuzhen Hall.

471
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,960
Only Yuzhen Hall?

472
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,880
You don't want Ninghe?

473
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Regarding Princess Ninghe,

474
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,520
I don't think you can call the shots.

475
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,560
But for the 300 warriors of sacrifice

476
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,160
of Yuzhen Hall,

477
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,720
I think you can

478
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,280
help me hide it from your father.

479
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Why do you think

480
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,200
that I'll agree?

481
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,840
Never mind if you won't.

482
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,120
You can have that and the man.

483
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,800
I'll go ahead.

484
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,040
All right.

485
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,000
You're agreeing so quickly?

486
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,400
Even if you don't ask me,

487
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
I'll also let them return.

488
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,240
Aren't you afraid?

489
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,240
300 people

490
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
is nothing to me.

491
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,240
Besides,

492
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,360
it's boring if the opponent

493
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,560
is not good when battling.

494
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
You're such a strange person.

495
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,600
I'll treat that as a compliment.

496
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,080
What are you doing?

497
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
With tea instead of wine,

498
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,440
let's celebrate
for collaborating officially.

499
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Aren't you afraid that it's poisoned?

500
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,480
If it is,

501
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll kill you.

502
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,760
Blowfish?

503
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,600
Who asked you to poison me?

504
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,480
Tell me.

505
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,600
(Perhaps her secret)

506
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
(is hidden here.)

507
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I still can't figure out

508
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,600
why you're helping Qi Yan.

509
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
Official Qiu doesn't like him

510
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
and wants to replace him.

511
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,800
Because no one else is more suitable
than him.

512
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,400
What?

513
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,760
I want to become queen.

514
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,000
Prince Guang is too pedantic.

515
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,440
Prince An is too weak.

516
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Besides,

517
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,800
if I become queen,

518
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,440
Qi Yan will keep getting sick.

519
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,200
Then

520
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
you can be like the female emperor

521
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,400
and manage state affairs on his behalf.

522
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,360
Amazing.

523
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
Then it won't matter

524
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,760
if Qi Yan is obedient or not.

525
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,360
Those royal prices in the backyard

526
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,320
can also be discarded.

527
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,080
By the way,

528
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
I think Zuo Ma found out

529
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,800
your identity.

530
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
What do you plan to do with him?

531
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,160
At most, he'll only find out
that my identity is fake.

532
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,280
He'll never find out who I am.

533
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,800
But we still can't let him live.

534
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,520
However, if we just kill him,

535
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
Father will surely ask the reason.

536
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Lock him up first.

537
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,800
Let's see after we think
of a fool-proof plan.

538
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,360
All right.

539
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
Get some rest.

540
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,600
We still have to welcome

541
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,440
Princess Ninghe tomorrow.

542
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,640
All right.

543
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,120
(No.)

544
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,440
(It's easy to kill her,)

545
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,280
(but once she dies,)

546
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
(without any real proof,)

547
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,840
(Eunuch Qiu will surely become furious,)

548
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,920
(and I'd be buried with her.)

549
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,320
Aunt.

550
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,080
Your Majesty.

551
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,800
What's the matter?

552
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,320
Did you have a nightmare?

553
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,960
Your Majesty.

554
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,520
If you're really worried

555
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,680
about Princess Ninghe,

556
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
send me to save her.

557
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Qiu Ziliang won't kill her.

558
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,840
I just want her

559
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,960
to stay in Hanliang Hall

560
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,080
and sound her out

561
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,680
if she's the real third party

562
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,800
or perhaps

563
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
lure the real third party out.

564
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,440
You mean...

565
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
This matter is very fishy,

566
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,360
there must be another story behind it.

567
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,640
Osmanthus cake from Liquan Pavilion?

568
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
It seems that you've had
a good discussion

569
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,480
with Qiu Yanzhi.

570
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,320
You were even in the mood
to buy osmanthus cake.

571
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,280
No.

572
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,600
I just happened to pass by.

573
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,800
When I went there,

574
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,560
only one piece was left.

575
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Your Majesty.

576
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,360
Here.

577
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
Have a bite.

578
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
After eating this,

579
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
your mood will lighten up.

580
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,840
Osmanthus cakes from other places

581
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,440
look nice

582
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
and intricate.

583
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,960
Only the ones from this place are...

584
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,520
It still tastes local and sweet.

585
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,960
Why do you keep smiling in a silly way?

586
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm smiling

587
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,600
because I think

588
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,760
that you're like this osmanthus cake.

589
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,040
It turns out

590
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
that to you,

591
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
this is how I look like?

592
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm saying

593
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
that you're like this place's
osmanthus cake

594
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
because

595
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
even if it doesn't

596
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,280
look very likable,

597
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,640
there are a lot of ingredients

598
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
and the flavor is rich,

599
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
especially the human touch.

600
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,880
It's just like how you are

601
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,200
to Princess Ninghe.

602
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,600
Even if she repeatedly wanted
to harm you,

603
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
you still

604
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
treat her like family.

605
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,440
Your Majesty.

606
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
I think that this version of you

607
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,000
is the best.

608
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,600
You're hungry?

609
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,400
No.

610
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,639
No?

611
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,719
Take it.

612
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,239
Eat it.

613
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,920
Are you feeling shy?

614
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,360
Your Majesty.

615
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,120
Come here.

616
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,520
Cheng Ruoyu.

617
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,440
What do you want to do again?

618
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,240
Come here.

619
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,240
Without my permission,

620
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,840
who allowed you to go into my bed?

621
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,640
It's not the first time.

622
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,640
It's not the first time?

623
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,000
Then how many times
do you want to do it?

624
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,560
Your Majesty.

625
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,400
Are you scared to come here?

626
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,520
Listen.

627
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,600
Lower your voice.

628
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm scared?

629
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,760
This is my bed.

630
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,280
Why would I be scared?

631
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,840
What will you do?

632
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,480
Massage me?

633
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Do you know how to do that?

634
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,800
Your Majesty.

635
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,960
I often had nightmares too.

636
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,680
After waking up from a nightmare,

637
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,280
I had the same symptoms as you.

638
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,800
My entire body was tense.

639
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,120
My head aches and I couldn't sleep.

640
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
When that happens,

641
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
Aunt would often

642
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,240
massage me this way

643
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,720
to let me relax.

644
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,880
That's why Cheng Xi is so dear to you?

645
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,360
Before,

646
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,040
I didn't remember anything,

647
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,520
and I didn't know how to do anything.

648
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,360
I would only cry.

649
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Aunt took care of me day and night.

650
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
Without her,

651
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,320
I wouldn't be here.

652
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,640
That's why you're siding
with your relative instead of reason?

653
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,120
Your Majesty.

654
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,360
I know that Aunt made a mistake.

655
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm not willing to give up on her.

656
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,680
But as your Sword Bearer,

657
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,880
I won't allow anyone

658
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
to harm you all the more,

659
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,840
including Aunt.

660
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,880
You're not old,

661
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,320
but you think a lot.

662
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Do you feel better?

663
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,760
Yes.

664
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,840
Go up more.

665
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,280
Your Majesty.

666
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,160
I have urgent matters to report.

667
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,520
Hurry.

668
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Your Majesty.

669
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,680
Ziyuan from Yuzhen Hall reported

670
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,680
that last night,

671
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
they were ambushed at Jingzhou.

672
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,560
Princess Ninghe is wounded
and unconscious.

673
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,440
She even said

674
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
that the Jingzhou governor

675
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,680
is investigating her entourage.

676
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,680
I'm afraid...

677
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm afraid that our people
will get exposed.

678
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
Yanzhi promised me

679
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
not to touch my people.

680
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,120
Who sent

681
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
the assassins then?

682
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,640
I'll personally go to Jingzhou.

683
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,800
Your Majesty.

684
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,480
You can't.

685
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,160
We're not sure about the situation yet.

686
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
If you go,

687
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,160
then you'll be putting yourself
in danger.

688
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Your Majesty.

689
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Let me go there.

690
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,320
The imperial court needs the emperor.

691
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,360
You can't leave the palace.

692
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
Let me go on your behalf

693
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
and check what's going on in Jingzhou.

694
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,520
How do you feel?

695
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
What is that?

696
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,440
Rosa rubus.

697
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
I picked up the smashed plant

698
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
and made it into a scented candle.

699
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,320
That's what you're smelling now.

700
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,360
The rosa rubus will die
once it leaves the soil.

701
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,480
You're quite competent.

702
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,640
What's the matter?

703
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Didn't you find out

704
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,160
who I am?

705
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,480
Of course you can't find out.

706
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,760
Because my identity

707
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,840
is authentic.

708
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,120
You wench.

709
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,320
Aside from making up your identity.

710
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,840
you and Prince Guang

711
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
even collaborated to kill You Ma.

712
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,440
You Ma killed himself.

713
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,320
Is that so?

714
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,560
Then I'll give you a chance.

715
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,440
With your conscience as guide,

716
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,200
can you say that again

717
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,360
with You Ma looking down at you
from above?

718
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
What's the matter?

719
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,800
You don't dare to?

720
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,280
You Ma died because he was useless.

721
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,160
What did that have to do with me?

722
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,840
You...

723
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,720
He was mesmerized...

724
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
He was mesmerized with the plant
and got poisoned

725
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,440
without knowing it.

726
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,360
He never got anything on Prince Guang
after watching him for eight years.

727
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,880
I felt disdain for such a useless man

728
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
when he was alive.

729
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,920
Why would I be scared of him
after he's dead?

730
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
I feel the same way about you.

731
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,880
Do you think

732
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,800
that I won't dare to kill you?

733
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
If Official Qiu didn't care about you,

734
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
you'd still be working

735
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,720
in the brothel.

736
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,080
Qiu Yanzhi.

737
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,120
You injured my hand.

738
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
How can you

739
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,040
not pay for it a bit?

740
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,040
But don't worry.

741
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,360
I'll surely be very gentle.

742
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,360
I'll surely be very gentle.
