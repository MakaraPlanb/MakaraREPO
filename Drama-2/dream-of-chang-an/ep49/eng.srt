=Episode 49=

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,280
I've summoned everyone again

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
because I have something important
to announce.

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
This is the legendary posthumous edict,

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,600
written by the late emperor himself

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,160
after the Morning Dew Rebellion.

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
All these years,

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,160
it has been sealed within a painting.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,759
And now,

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
it has finally seen the light of day again.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
This posthumous edict

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
is the real one.

25
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
But

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,440
there's more to it than meeting the eye.

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
That is why

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
I've summoned everyone here.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,640
I need to explain

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,880
the secret behind the posthumous edict.

32
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,120
(Thirteenth Uncle, Prince Guang)

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,570
(My fifth younger brother, Prince Yi)

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,480
This...

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,120
What's going on?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
How is this possible?

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,680
The posthumous edict

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,080
was written using special ink.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
The ink will never disappear.

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
Only four words

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
will disappear
once they touch water.

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
Uncle, you have treated me with
such kindness and virtue.

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
But the late emperor and I used you.

44
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,440
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,080
Back then, before the start
of the Morning Dew Rebellion,

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
the late emperor was afraid
that the plan might fail.

47
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,160
That's why he met me in private.

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
He wanted me to imitate Goujian.

49
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
He wanted me to acknowledge
Qiu Ziliang as my father

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
and inherit the throne.

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
Since the late emperor
wanted to protect me,

52
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,880
he had to let another person

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,480
be the centre of

54
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,880
Qiu Ziliang's attention and hatred.

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
That's why

56
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
he chose Prince Guang.

57
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
So that's the case.

58
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
I was wondering why the late emperor

59
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
would pass the throne to me

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
when he didn't even like me.

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
After the Morning Dew Rebellion failed,

62
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,640
Qiu Ziliang

63
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
didn't kill my brother.

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,960
Instead, he put him under house arrest.

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
And Brother

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,000
had urged me

67
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
to proceed

68
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
with the plan.

69
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
Uncle,

70
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,480
you were always on a mountain retreat.

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
That's how you were able
to escape the disaster.

72
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,560
So, were you the one behind it?

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes.

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,120
I

75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,400
didn't completely agree

76
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,280
with the late emperor's plan.

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,920
I wasn't willing to let you suffer
on my behalf.

78
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,840
That's why I ordered my men
to spread the news.

79
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,880
I told them to say that you have to
distance yourself from wars and conflict

80
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,760
because you were instructed by a saint
to do so.

81
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,520
Using that to my advantage,
I did live in seclusion.

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
Qiu Ziliang

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,240
did stop hunting for me after that.

84
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,480
So, we saved each other.

85
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Indeed.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
If I were blinded by greed

87
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,400
and inherited the throne
using the posthumous edict,

88
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
I'm afraid I would be
the laughing stock of the world

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
once

90
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,600
the truth has been revealed.

91
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
Uncle, that won't happen.

92
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
People often say that
humans are unpredictable.

93
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,960
But Uncle,

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,520
you only became who you are

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
by overcoming such ordeals.

96
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Today,

97
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,280
I summoned all of you here

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,480
to witness this ceremony.

99
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,040
I

100
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,600
will select Prince Guang
as the Crown Prince.

101
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,920
Your Majesty.

102
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,800
Uncle,

103
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,440
you deserved everything.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,040
I will humbly accept your edict.

105
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Long live Your Majesty.

107
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,880
Your Majesty,

108
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
the new generals of the Shencai Army

109
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
have assumed command.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,040
Before this, Li Zening

111
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
was bewitched by Left Minister's
Peach Blossom Jade Bangle

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and committed a grave mistake.

113
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,280
Official Li wrote a letter personally

114
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,640
to beg leniency for her sake.

115
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Your Majesty, please take a look.

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
I understand.

117
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,440
You may leave.

118
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,760
Your Majesty,

120
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
I thought Han Ding...

121
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,360
Speak.

122
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
Wasn't Han Ding a traitor?

123
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,280
The Left Minister tried to bribe him.

124
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
I told him to outwit them
with their tricks.

125
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,840
So,

126
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,480
Your Majesty,

127
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,040
when you wrote
a retirement letter for Uncle Huaizhi

128
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,640
and sent me away,

129
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,000
were all of those part of your plan?

130
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,320
I

131
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,000
was just afraid that
I would die suddenly

132
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,040
like my brother.

133
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,360
If that happens,

134
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
I

135
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
don't want you

136
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,960
to stay by my side

137
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
and laugh at me.

138
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Nonsense.

139
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,760
You mustn't curse yourself,

140
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,520
understood?

141
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
The sons of the Qi Family,

142
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,040
it's either they are too young,
or they are mediocre.

143
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
After much thought,

144
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,160
I figured out that Uncle

145
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,840
was the only one
who could accomplish this task.

146
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,480
And

147
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,520
he stood up to my test.

148
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
That's why

149
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,560
I came up with that idea.

150
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,800
That's not it.

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,560
Actually,

152
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
I had that idea in my mind long ago.

153
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
I just didn't dare to think about it.

154
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,280
I didn't dare to hope.

155
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
But now,

156
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
I finally have the chance to do so.

157
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,320
Your Majesty, you mean...

158
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,840
Yu'er,

159
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,280
we can finally be together.

160
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
I wish to spend the rest of my life

161
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,920
with you.

162
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,040
You have suffered so much

163
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
because of me.

164
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,280
I

165
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
will remember
what you did for me forever.

166
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Now,

167
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,240
we can

168
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,560
finally be together.

169
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
We can lead the lives we want.

170
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,300
(Yijia Gambling Den)

171
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,540
(Zuiyue Wine Store)

172
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,680
What day is today?

173
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Your Highness,

174
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,560
today is the 15th.

175
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,680
It's the Lantern Festival.

176
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Your Majesty,

177
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
let me borrow her for a moment.

178
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,400
(Yan's Textile)
Where are you bringing me?

179
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,640
What's wrong?

180
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
His Majesty summoned me during the day.

181
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,000
He thanked me for my assistance.

182
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,720
He asked me about my requests.

183
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
So, what are your requests?

184
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
My requests?

185
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,600
First,

186
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,240
I want a panacea

187
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,840
so that my looks can be restored.

188
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,040
Second,

189
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,600
I wish to travel around the Four Seas,

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,720
I wish for a husband.

193
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,040
No.

194
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,080
You can't take His Majesty away from me.

195
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,720
No one wants your emperor.

196
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,319
Third,

197
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,839
I wish for a husband,

198
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,760
a strong and healthy husband.

199
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,280
Look at His Majesty.

200
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,200
In just one year,

201
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,359
from a strong warrior,

202
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
he ended up in that state.

203
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,040
Only a silly girl like you

204
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,120
cares about him.

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,240
Since young,

206
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,520
I have always admired the prosperous
state of the Xing empire.

(Zuiyue Wine Store)

208
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,000
I've seen the dances and singing
during times of peace.

209
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,640
I've seen

210
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
the flames of war as well.

211
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Although it's a pity

212
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,080
that I wasn't able to witness
a peaceful world,

213
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,920
I know that countless loyal officials

214
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
and brave warriors had
sacrificed their lives

215
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,680
to produce such a splendid scene.

216
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,600
I have

217
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
no regret in life now.

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Yu'er,

219
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
thank you.

220
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,160
Yu'er,

221
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
I'll return home tomorrow.

222
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,400
Take care.

223
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,520

225
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,640
Your Majesty,

226
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,080
the jujube cake I bought just now

227
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,880
was delicious.

228
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,640
There's

229
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,400
an osmanthus cake stall in the front.

230
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
Their cakes are delicious as well.

231
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
You should eat more then.

232
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Let us buy more of them.

233
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,000
Even if they're delicious,

234
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
we can't buy too many of them.

235
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
We can visit this place

236
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,080
during next year's Lantern Festival.

237
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,640
By the way,

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,200
I think Han Ding has his hands full.

239
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
I've trained him for a long time.

240
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,800
This is the time for him
to prove his usefulness to me.

241
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
Just let him hold them.

242
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,120
I

243
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,160
wish to see the results of his training.

244
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,960
I thought you loved the cakes?

245
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,120
Although I do love them,

246
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
I can't consume them any more.

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Where's the source of the poison?

314

in every prescription

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800

Your Majesty,

322
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
you must stop consuming this medicine.

323
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Although this potent medicine

324
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
is effective,

325
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,280
your body won't be able to
withstand its repercussion.

326
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,080
I understand.

327
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,720
But if I don't consume it,

328
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
and if I only consume the Carefree Pill,

329
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,000
just like its namesake,

330
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
I will not worry about anything.

Your Majesty,

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
although fighting poison with poison

335
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
may help you clear your mind,

336
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,320
it has grave repercussions for the body.

337
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,040
- You will only live for a few months.
- Enough.

338
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
Divine healer, heed my edict.

339
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,520
I order you to
prescribe the same medicine.

340
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,200
And

342
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,240
you must not let anyone know about this.

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Until now,

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,120
besides the medicinal soup,

345
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,360
His Majesty has consumed
39 Ning Shen Pills.

346
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,720
Although the poison
has spread to his lungs,

347
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,120
it has extended
His Majesty's life as well.

348
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,960
Why?

349
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Why did you do so?

350
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
For the Xing empire.

351
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,640
For a worthy death.

352
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,920
You must think carefully.

353
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
If His Majesty dies

354
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,360
after consuming the pill,

355
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,640
you will be a regicide.

356
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,360
His Majesty,

357
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm sure he will wake up.

358
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,760
Your Majesty!

359
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,720
Your Majesty!

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,800
You're awake.

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Stop crying.

363
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,560
You look better when you smile.

364
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,600
Ever since you entered the palace,

365
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,960
you have smiled less and less.

366
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,040
Throughout my life,

367
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,920
because of Teacher's will,

368
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,040
because of my brother's wish,

369
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,640
and because of the fate
of the Xing empire,

370
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,440
I devote myself.

371
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
I will die soon.

372
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,200
I don't know

373
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,960
if I am a good emperor.

374
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,800
You're a good emperor.

375
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,280
Now, the people are living in peace.

376
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
Their happiness knows no bound.

377
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,120
The state of the Xing empire
is prosperous.

378
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,600
Everyone is praising you.

379
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,760
You did a great job.

380
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,760
But I'm really tired.

381
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
I have to calculate every step I make.

382
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,600
I don't dare to commit
the slightest mistake.

383
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
If the afterlife does exist,

384
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,320
in my next life,

385
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,920
I hope I can live for my sake.

386
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,920
I wish to be a commoner.

387
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,760
I wish to stay by your side
for the rest of my life.

388
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
It will happen.

389
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,920
That day will surely arrive.

390
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
In our next lives,

391
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,080
we will be together.

392
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,920
But Yu'er,

393
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,400
I may not be able to survive for long.

394
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,520
I know.

395
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,600
I know you don't want

396
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,800
to be imprisoned within the palace.

397
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,800
So...

398
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,160
So, I will order Han Ding

399
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,160
to send you out of the palace.

400
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,400
Going on safari is my favourite hobby.

401
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
There are plenty of scenery

402
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
which I haven't seen yet.

403
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,600
Promise me.

404
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,320
You need to be happy
for the rest of your life.

405
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Go...

406
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,560
Go and explore the vast world
on my behalf.

407
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Go and observe
the stars and moon on my behalf.

408
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,840
I promise.

409
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,640
I promise.

410
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
I promise!

411
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,560
I promise.

412
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,200
Uncle.

413
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,520
Hold me up.

414
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Uncle, have a seat.

415
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,240
I

416
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,640
will die soon.

417
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Fortunately, the eunuch's faction
has been vanquished.

418
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,680
There are many things
waiting to be done.

419
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
Prince Guang, heed my edict.

420
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,960
My uncle Prince Guang
is a man of great wisdom and vision.

421
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,040
He has experienced hardship.

422
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,800
He carries to become a wise ruler.

423
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,520
I shall pass my throne to Prince Guang.

424
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,680
With the duty bestowed upon
by the seven ancestral shrines

425
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,800
and the duty entrusted by the world,

426
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
this edict shall be carried out
by the administration.

427
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,960
Your Majesty, I will

428
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
humbly accept your edict.

429
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,400
Uncle,

430
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,520
please rise.

431
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,320
Your Majesty.

432
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,960

(On the 23rd of lunar March,)

458
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,400
(Qi Yan passed away
within Changming Palace.)

459
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,120
(His posthumous title was Shizong,)

460
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,800
(and his body was buried within
the Chang Mausoleum.)

461
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,440
(Prince Guang, Qi Chen,
inherited the throne,)

462
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
(changing the reign title to Pingzhong.)

463
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,240
His Majesty has arrived.

464
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,760
Madam Jade is to receive
the imperial edict.

465
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,920
Gods in heaven and earth.

466
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,520
Spirit of the sword.

467
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,200
My heart is like a sword,

468
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,960
suppressing the wicked
and eliminating evil.

469
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,720
My sword is like my heart,

470
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
protecting the nation
and being loyal to the emperor.

471
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:28,910
(Little Yu'er's Biang Biang Noodle Shop)

472
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,480
Please.

473
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,280
Shopkeeper,

474
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,240
give me another bowl of noodles.

475
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,960
Right away.

476
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,280
Here are your noodles.

477
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,040
Sir, please.

478
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,720
Come.

479
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,600
- We fortunately catch the opportunity.
- Here are your noodles.

480
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,760
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

481
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,720
Enjoy your meal.

482
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,240
If the late emperor

483
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,440
didn't cancel the
Menyin official selection system

484
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
and introduced
the imperial examination system,

485
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,560
poor people like us

486
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,920
will never be able to make a name
for ourselves.

487
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,600
You're right.

488
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,640
Let's enjoy our noodles first.

489
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,360
Of course we only dare to sell our goods

490
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
when the nation is at peace.

491
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,520
No one dares to go out

492
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,400
during wartime.

493
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,320

Shopkeeper,

497
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,560
get me the bill.

498
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,800
Coming.

499
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,920
How much?

500
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,640
Four bowls? That will be ten wen.

501
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,120
All right.

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,000
