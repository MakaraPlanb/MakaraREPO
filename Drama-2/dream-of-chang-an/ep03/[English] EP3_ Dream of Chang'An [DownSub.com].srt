Your Majesty,

17
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
are you okay?

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,200
I am fine.

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,560
Qiu Yanzhi,

20
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,360
do you really have nothing to do
with the assassination attempts

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600
for the past few days?

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,240
I was planning to ask you
the same thing.

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
What do you mean by that?

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
How did the assassins

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
find out that we were leaving
the palace today?

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,320
They even knew that we were
coming to this wine store today.

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
You're suspecting me?

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,200
Why are you suspecting me then?

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,840
You!

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,440
Let us return to the palace.

31
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,540
(Violet Bureau)

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
What?

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Someone tried to
assassinate His Majesty?

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Aunt,

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,360
can you neutralise

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,080
the poison for me?

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,200
If not, I can't do anything

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
because of how lethargic I feel.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,120
Thank you, Aunt.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,480
Your poison will be neutralised
after you take this for three days.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
I need to take this for three days?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,920
If it isn't necessary,

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,960
you shouldn't leave the palace
for the next few days.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,800
Aunt,

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,240
that Qiu Yanzhi said
she wasn't related to the assassination.

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,960
Do you believe in her?

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
You must never

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,320
believe in Qiu Yanzhi's words.

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,800
That's right.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
I don't believe her either.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,920
It's highly likely

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,480
that she was the one
behind the assassination attempt.

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,680
She did so in order to
gain His Majesty's trust.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,920
Heng'an City is filled with her spies.

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm sure no one dares

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
to assassinate His Majesty

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,800
and make the Chess of Generals Camp
their scapegoat.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,520
So,

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm sure Qiu Yanzhi is behind this.

60
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,880
I'm sure the Violet Bureau

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,120
was the one behind the act

62
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
in order to gain Qi Yan's trust.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Although the Violet Bureau
is the bodyguard of the emperor,

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,320
Qi Yan only managed to ascend the throne

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
by betraying the late emperor.

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
To Cheng Xi,

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,160
who was loyal to the late emperor,

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Qi Yan is an enemy.

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,440
Cheng Xi

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,760
had assigned the title of Sword Bearer
to her own niece.

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
She staged the assassination attempts

72
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,200
in order to let Cheng Ruoyu and Qi Yan

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,320
face the danger together

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,320
and strengthen their bond.

75
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,240
I don't want any assumptions.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
I want solid proof.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,840
Can't you even find one piece of clue?

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,000
We've interrogated

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
everyone on the streets.

80
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
All of them said

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,520
the assassins fled into an alley.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
But that alley was a dead end.

83
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,400
No one can hide in there.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
And it only has one exit.

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
And, regarding their attire and weapons,

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
after our investigation,

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
we found out that they belonged to
the Shencai Army.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
If Eunuch Qiu hears about this,

89
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm sure he'll be enraged.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Father still doesn't know about it?

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,240
You would've been in trouble

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,240
if he knew about it.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,760
Violet Bureau isn't the one
behind the assassination attempt.

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,680
Cheng Ruoyu has lost
all of her martial arts.

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,400
Even if they want to stage a play,

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,200
they won't do it at this exact moment.

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,800
If not,

98
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,520
their ploy will be exposed easily.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,560
That's right.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,400
That old fox, Cheng Xi,

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,120
won't be this careless.

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,400
So,

103
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
the mastermind is trying to
drive a wedge between us.

104
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
He plans to do something big.

105
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
What do you mean?

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
What day is today?

107
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
9th of the second lunar month.

108
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,640
Father's birthday,

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,880
which is on the 15th of
the second lunar month,

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
will be arriving soon.

111
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,920
Your Majesty,

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,680
Duke Chu has stated

113
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,120
that we don't need to
hold a grand celebration

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
for his 59th birthday.

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,280
Your Majesty, Duke Chu said

116
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,640
(Eunuch, Gao Ping)
he will be content if he can drink together

117
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,680
with you and some of
the closer court officials.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
And,

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
Duke Chu said

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,440
that he is getting older,

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
and he doesn't feel as energetic.

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,120
He wishes

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
to see a performance
prepared by the youngsters.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
He hoped that the ladies from
the Violet Bureau

125
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,400
could prepare
a Sword Dance performance for him.

126
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Eunuch Gao,

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,640
we from the Violet Bureau
are bodyguards of the emperor.

128
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,800
If he wishes to see a performance,

129
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
he should find songstresses and dancers.

130
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,560
Sword Bearer, what are you saying?

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Back then, Madam Gongsun was a big shot.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,520
Even so, she still had to perform
in front of His Majesty

133
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
during the Thousand Maple Festival.

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
That's a different story.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,400
The Thousand Maple Festival
celebrates the birthday of an emperor.

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,640
How could you compare it
with the birthday of a slave?

137
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Huaizhi.

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

139
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,680
Haven't you taught your niece
how to speak nicely yet?

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,320
Yu'er.

141
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
Tell Godfather

142
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,920
that I've received his message.

143
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
I will prepare
a great performance for him

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
in order not to disappoint him.

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,080
This must be your idea.

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,280
My father

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
had arranged Gao Ping

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
to stay beside His Majesty.

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,520
Every word

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that you had said

152
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,920
will be reported to my father

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
without fail.

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,320
Of course I'm not afraid of him

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,120
when I dare to say them out.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
I know you're not afraid of him.

157
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
But why don't you ask your uncle

158
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,680
if he's afraid of him or not?

159
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
What about your aunt?

160
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
What about His Majesty?

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
(So as a prey,)

162
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,680
(do you know what to do?)

163
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
When I'm weak,

164
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,320
I should hide.

165
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,840
When the hunter is exhausted,

166
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
I will strike.

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
If I were you,

168
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I would tell Madam Cheng

169
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,120
to prepare for the performance,

170
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
so that

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
the performance can satisfy my father
during his birthday

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
and let His Majesty rest at ease.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
Your Majesty,

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
I will notify Aunt immediately.

175
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,240
All right.

176
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,480
I will make the necessary preparations.

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
You should return for now.

178
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,080
Aunt,

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
don't you have any other way?

180
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
Must we really dance for that eunuch?

181
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
As long as Qiu Ziliang has control

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,720
over the Shencai Army,

183
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
we will have no other choice.

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,440
When will I

185
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
recover my strength?

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,520
You need two more days.

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I can't stand

188
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,720
such a humiliating life anymore.

189
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I wonder how His Majesty

190
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
is enduring it.

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,400
He doesn't want to die.

192
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,840
That's why he can only endure it.

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,160
But he's the emperor.

194
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,400
He's the emperor of the Xing empire.

195
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,080
How could he let
an eunuch rule his country?

196
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
What about the generals in Shencai Army?

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
What about the court officials
in the court?

198
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,160
My goodness.

199
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,840
They're well-educated?

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
That is it?

201
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Isn't there anyone who will stand out

202
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
and fight against the injustice?

203
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
Those who stood out

204
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
and fought against

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,160
the injustice,

206
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
all died.

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
They died during
the Morning Dew Rebellion.

208
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,870
(Hanyuan Hall)

209
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
(Your Highness, now, you need)

210
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
(to take on the path of a sinner.)

211
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,440
(No one will understand you.)

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,840
(You will become
the people's object of scorn.)

213
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
(Even your closest kin)

214
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,880
(will be disappointed in you.)

215
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,800
(However,)

216
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,040
(your suffering has its purpose to it.)

217
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,880
(If you don't endure the suffering,)

218
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
(you won't be able
to achieve your wish.)

219
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
(You need to endure.)

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680
(You need to endure
much more than anyone else.)

221
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,680
(Hanyuan Hall)

222
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
(When you think
you're at the brink of your limit,)

223
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,280
(think about two words.)

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
(Morning Dew.)

225
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,280
(Think about His Majesty,)

226
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,240
(Heng'an)
(think about Han Yue,)

227
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
(think about)

228
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,440
(Heng'an City, filled with blood.)

229
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,440
(Think about your late subjects.)

230
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,640
(Think about the price we paid)

231
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,240
(in exchange for your peace.)

232
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,800
(Your Highness,)

233
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
(you're our last hope.)

234
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,040
(Violet Bureau)

235
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,560
Aunt,

236
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
have you come up with another way?

237
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,480
Give them my instructions

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
and tell them to practise for the dance.

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,680
Why don't we use this chance

240
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
to kill Qiu Ziliang?

241
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,400
What?

242
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,560
During the dance,

243
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,360
I'll kill him

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,160
when he lets down his guard.

245
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,240
I'll turn his birthday
into his death anniversary.

246
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Only by killing him

247
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
will we be able

248
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
to get rid of him

249
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
and his ploys once and for all.

250
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
You want to kill him?

251
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
What about you?

252
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,760
With my death,

253
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
I will bring peace to Chang'an.

254
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,440
It's worth it.

255
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Shut up!

256
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,600
I've spent a lot of effort in saving you

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
and raising you up.

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
Now, you want me to
let you sacrifice yourself?

259
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
Aunt, calm down.

260
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm just trying to avenge you.

261
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,320
I don't need you to avenge me!

262
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
You better forget about that.

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
You're not allowed to
even think about it!

264
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,880
Go and practise your dance.

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Return the antidote to me.
I'll take it back.

266
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
Return it to me!

267
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,680
This...

268
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
What's wrong?

269
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,760
What's wrong?

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
You think it's that easy

271
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,840
for you to kill Qiu Ziliang?

272
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Since he dares to visit
the Violet Bureau,

273
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm sure he has prepared himself
for the worst case scenario.

274
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,200
You'll only sacrifice your life

275
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
in vain

276
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
and give Qiu Ziliang

277
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,840
an opportunity to get rid
of the Violet Bureau.

278
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,280
I understand.

279
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,760
You're still as foolish as always.

280
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,040
Get downstairs and practise your dance!

281
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Go now.

282
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,560
Madam,

283
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
please calm down.

284
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,000
It was hard for me

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,880
to nurture her

286
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,560
and hide her identity until now.

287
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,240
But now, she's trying to sacrifice
her life, just like what Jing Ke has done.

288
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,600
Yu'er will surely understand your effort

289
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,760
if she didn't lose her memories.

290
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,600
If killing Qiu Ziliang

291
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
were that easy,

292
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,960
I wouldn't have failed

293
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
and hurt myself in the past.

294
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,400
If we want to get rid of Qiu Ziliang,

295
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
we can only depend on the emperor.

296
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
And, to inspire His Majesty

297
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
and ignite his determination,

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,640
we can only...

299
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Don't shoot!

300
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't!

301
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't!

302
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't!

303
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
My dreams

304
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,400
are getting more and more ridiculous.

305
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,240
Why would I dream of
His Majesty trying to kill me?

306
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,600
His Majesty was with
Qiu Ziliang as well.

307
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
This Duke Chu is something.

308
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
He insists on holding
his birthday celebration

309
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
at the Violet Bureau.

310
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,800
We have to withstand the cold
because of...

311
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,920
His Majesty has arrived.

312
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
Kneel!

313
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,080
Long live Your Majesty.

314
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,280
Rise.

315
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

316
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,440
Let's enter the hall.

317
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,680
Duke Chu has arrived.

318
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,350
(Violet Bureau)

319
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
I was feeling unwell.

320
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,760
That's why I was late.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

322
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,360
Godfather, you came just in time.

323
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,280
Please.

324
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,120
Where is Prince Guang?

325
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,960
Eunuch Qiu,

326
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,000
Prince Guang is feeling unwell.

327
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,960
Therefore, he isn't able to come.

328
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
He has sent his men

329
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
to deliver birthday gifts
to your residence.

330
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
This is such a pity.

331
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,760
Godfather, the court officials and I
are here to celebrate your birthday.

332
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,280
I guess that's enough.

333
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Madam Cheng,

334
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,200
today, I hope I can
witness something new.

335
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
I hope the renowned Sword Dance

336
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,920
of the Violet Bureau can impress me.

337
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Please begin.

338
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,680
This Little Fish

339
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,440
may seem like she's good at dancing,

340
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
but it's just a lacklustre performance.

341
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,320
She lacks the strength
to dance properly.

342
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,960
This girl is born with natural beauty

343
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
and she moves like a fairy.

344
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
She has great talents.

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,160
It's a pity...

346
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
It's a pity that she belongs to
the Violet Bureau.

347
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,040
It all falls on you now.

348
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,040
It all depends on

349
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
when you'll take over the Violet Bureau.

350
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, Father.

351
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,520
(Now,)

352
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,280
(you want me to
let you sacrifice yourself?)

353
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Wu!

354
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,360
Wu!

355
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,680
Guards!

356
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,800
Are you okay?

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm wearing a breastplate underneath.

358
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm fine.

359
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Wu!

360
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,240
Why?

361
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,120
Why?

362
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,680
Tell us!

363
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,640
Who exactly are you?

364
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,120
Why are you trying to assassinate
Eunuch Qiu?

365
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,640
Tell us!

366
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Who sent you here?

367
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,480
It's His Majesty.

368
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,760
Wu!

369
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,840
What are you saying?

370
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,120
How could it be His Majesty?

371
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,360
What nonsense are you spouting?

372
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,320
Wu!

373
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,440
Wu!

374
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
Yu'er.

375
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,120
Your Majesty,

377
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,960
Eunuch Qiu,

378
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,280
I was unaware

379
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
of her plan.

380
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
Please leave the investigation to me.

381
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
I will get to the bottom of this.

382
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
Leave it to you?

383
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
Don't tell me you want to silence them?

384
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,920
I will never cover up for the culprit.

385
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,680
Your Majesty, please trust me.

386
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,080
Godfather, what do you say?

387
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,040
Let's leave this to the Chess Overseer.

388
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,000
Understood.

389
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,440
Your Majesty,

390
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,560
please allow me to
join the investigation.

391
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,480
Wu belongs to the Violet Bureau.

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,120
Today, she has committed a crime

393
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,800
and pushed the blame towards you,
Your Majesty.

394
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
This is a serious matter.

395
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
In order to prove our innocence,

396
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,680
in order to maintain the law,

397
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
Your Majesty,

398
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,880
Duke Chu,

399
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
please allow me to
join the investigation.

400
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,520
Fine.

401
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,280
So,

402
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
Chess Overseer and Sword Bearer,
please do your best

403
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,200
in investigating the case.

404
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,040
Yu'er!

405
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,520
Yu'er!

406
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,200
Yu'er!

407
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,720
Yu'er!

408
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,560
Your Majesty,

409
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,960
Madam Cheng is here.

410
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,400
I've failed my duty.

411
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,760
Your Majesty, please punish me.

412
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,800
The assassin's name

413
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
was Guan Wu.

414
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,400
It's been eight years since she first
joined the Violet Bureau.

415
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
She has always been honest and loyal.

416
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,520
To be honest,

417
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
I would never expect her
to be an assassin.

418
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,760
Is the Sword Bearer doing okay?

419
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,040
Yu'er is still in a coma.

420
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
It's an old ailment of hers.

421
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
It's nothing major.

422
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,520
We can speak

423
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
after she wakes up from her coma.

424
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
But Your Majesty,

425
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,000
I hope...

426
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,600
Madam Cheng,

427
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
you can't do anything about it.

428
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,240
You should go back.

429
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,700
(Violet Bureau)

431
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,040
Yu'er!

432
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,640
Yu'er!

433
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,080
Yu'er!

434
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,880
It's getting late.

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
We can continue the interrogation
tomorrow, okay?

436
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Yu'er!

437
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,960
You just regained consciousness.

438
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,480
And the wound on your hand
has barely recovered.

439
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,120
You...

440
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,960
I must see Wu.

441
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,560
I need to clarify the truth with her.

442
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,000
Yu'er!

443
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,400
Little Fish,

444
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,480
so you're awake?

445
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,160
Chess Overseer,

446
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,680
the assassin has lost too much blood.

447
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,480
We manage to save her life
with some medicines.

448
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
But she won't last for long.

449
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,760
How long can she stay alive?

450
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,680
At most, 24 hours.

451
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,120
That's more than enough.

452
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,880
You may leave.

453
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,880
Yes, Chess Overseer.

454
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,040
Let's end this quickly then.

455
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,000
We should torture her
as soon as possible.

456
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
You're not allowed to force her
to confess through torture.

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,800
Torture?

458
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
That's no fun at all.

459
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,240
I know plenty of ways

460
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,400
to make her talk.

461
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
I'll make sure our lovely assassin

462
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,080
tells us everything she knows.

463
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,600
For example,

464
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,600
we can procure a kind of meat,

465
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,280
slice it thin,

466
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
and roast it until it's done.

467
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,480
If she doesn't answer our questions,

468
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,080
she has to eat one slice.

469
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,040
She has to eat two slices
if she keeps quiet.

470
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,760
What kind of meat?

471
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,040
Her own meat.

472
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,880
And,

473
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,960
we can spread some honey
all over her wound.

474
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
It'll attract ants to
climb all over her body.

475
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
You're a beast.

476
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
I won't let you do so.

477
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
You don't have the right
to make the call here.

478
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Let her take this.

479
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,800
What is that?

480
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,200
Painkillers.

481
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
It can relieve her pain temporarily

482
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
so that she can answer our questions.

483
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,920
Wu.

484
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,840
Wu.

485
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,080
You must tell me the truth.

486
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,640
Only then, I can save you.

487
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,760
Kill me.

488
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,120
Kill me.

489
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,800
I beg you.

490
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,600
His Majesty has arrived!

491
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

492
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm here to observe the interrogation.

493
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,040
Proceed with your interrogation.

494
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

495
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,320
Wu,

496
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,040
if I can't figure out

497
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,880
who's the mastermind behind this,

498
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,080
Aunt

499
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,160
and everyone in the Violet Bureau

500
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,240
will be implicated.

501
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
Do you really want that to happen?

502
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,000
You and I have
known each other for years.

503
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,120
I know you aren't a person

504
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,640
who can be bribed by
wealth and benefits.

505
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,480
So there's only one possibility

506
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,240
as to why you tried to
assassinate Duke Chu.

507
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
It's because you wanted to seek revenge.

508
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,360
Am I right?

509
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,760
I wonder how Yu'er

510
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,640
is doing with the interrogation.

511
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
I thought I was a cautious person.

512
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
I didn't expect this to happen
under my watch.

513
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm in huge trouble

514
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,440
because of Guan Wu.

515
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,120
Madam,

516
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,760
why did she try to
assassinate Qiu Ziliang?

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,520
That's not important.

518
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
Qiu Ziliang has offended
all kinds of people.

519
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,480
Plenty of people are
trying to assassinate him.

520
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
The most important thing is

521
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,120
that she belongs to the Violet Bureau.

522
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,840
If they want to investigate her,

523
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,640
they'll investigate the Violet Bureau.

524
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Yu'er and Guan Wu

525
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,040
joined the bureau at the same time.

526
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,400
It's fine if they want
to investigate Guan Wu.

527
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
I just hope

528
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,040
that they won't investigate Yu'er.

529
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,200
Under Chess Overseer's order,

530
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
we're here to investigate
Guan Wu's assassination attempt.

531
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,240
Now,

532
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,120
find everything that is related

533
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,160
to Guan Wu and the entire Violet Bureau,

534
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,200
including their records, accounts,
and their household registers.

535
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,240
Find them immediately.

536
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,920
Hurry!

537
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,360
Yes, sir.

538
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
Do you have a grudge against Duke Chu?

539
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,680
Wu.

540
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Why are you here?

541
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm here to look for you.

542
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,280
What are you doing?

543
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm burning some offerings
for my father.

544
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Is today your father's
death anniversary?

545
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,320
Is it because of your father?

546
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,360
I thought that you burning offerings
for your father in secret last night

547
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,160
was strange.

548
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,040
You looked distracted

549
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,120
during daytime as well.

550
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,560
Wu,

551
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,040
if you suffer from any grievances,

552
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,120
you must tell us about it.

553
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,600
His Majesty is here.

554
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
He will uphold justice for you.

555
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,040
Where did she burn her offerings

556
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,600
last night?

557
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,680
It's a side hall

558
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,480
300 steps west of the Violet Bureau.

559
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,640
Yu'er.

560
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,560
Investigate that hall.

561
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,240
Yes, Chess Overseer.

562
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,640
Search the place.

563
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,480
Yes, sir.

564
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,670
(Grave of Zheng Lu,
father of the Zheng Family)

565
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,320
Your Majesty.

566
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,170
(Grave of Zheng Lu,
father of the Zheng Family)

567
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,760
So Zheng Lu is your father.

568
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
Zheng Lu?

569
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Zheng Lu was the traitor

570
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,320
who died eight years ago

571
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
for going against His Majesty
and Eunuch Qiu.

572
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,360
My father isn't a traitor!

573
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,640
No.

574
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,600
He's not a traitor!

575
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,880
Wu,

576
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,800
so you did this in order to
avenge your father,

577
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,480
am I right?

578
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,000
My father was innocent.

579
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,040
He wasn't a traitor.

580
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,000
My entire family was slaughtered!

581
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,760
He was innocent!

582
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Yu'er!

583
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,160
Your Majesty,

584
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,360
she has confessed to her crime.

585
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
She's the daughter of Zheng Lu.

586
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,240
She tried to assassinate Duke Chu
in order to avenge his father.

587
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
She insists that
her father was innocent.

588
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,640
Your Majesty, please re-examine the case

589
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,560
and return them their innocence.

590
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Are you done?

591
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,440
You know the best

592
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,560
whether my father was innocent or not.

593
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,720
Losers are always in the wrong.

594
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,920
I just wish for a quick death.

595
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,720
I hope

596
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,680
you can prove my father's innocence.

597
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,640
Release her.

598
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,800
Wu!

599
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,800
Wu!

600
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,000
Wu!

601
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,040
I'll grant you your wish.

602
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,800
Wu!

603
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,080
Wu!

604
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,440
Wu!

605
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,480
Wu!

606
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
Losers are always in the wrong.
You said so yourself.

607
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,960
So,

608
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
you don't have the right to
make me prove your father's innocence.

609
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
The truth has been revealed.

610
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,520
The case can be closed.

611
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,720
You two may return in peace

612
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,920
and give Duke Chu

613
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
a satisfactory explanation.

614
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,000
Your Majesty!

615
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,160
Why did you let her kill herself?

616
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,400
Why didn't you re-examine the case?

617
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,680
She's the offspring of a traitor.

618
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,440
She deserves to die.

619
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,520
She told us

620
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,320
that her father was innocent.

621
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,520
To me,

622
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,320
Zheng Lu is a traitor.

623
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,000
And,

624
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,680
she tried to assassinate

625
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,960
an important court official
in front of me.

626
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,120
No matter for what reason she did so,

627
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,480
that reason alone is enough for her
to suffer 1,000 deaths.

628
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,840
Cheng Ruoyu,

629
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,160
what's a sword?

630
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Sword is a weapon.

631
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,520
It's meant for killing.

632
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,080
As my Sword Bearer,

633
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,040
if this kind of situation happens again,

634
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,520
you should unsheathe your sword

635
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,560
and slay the assassin.

636
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,560
His Majesty will return to the palace.

637
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,000
Are you satisfied

638
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,680
with this ending?

639
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,320
Back then, the Zheng Family
was massacred.

640
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,240
How did Zheng Wu manage to escape?

641
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Who helped her to escape,

642
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,600
made a fake identity for her,

643
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,960
(Prison)
and allowed her to sneak into the palace?

644
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,520
And, she has been
hiding for numerous years.

645
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,760
Why is she trying

646
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,520
to assassinate him right now?

647
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,600
With her martial arts,

648
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm sure she knew that she would fail.

649
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,320
Why is she sacrificing her life
for nothing?

650
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
If I don't get to the bottom of this,

651
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,200
I won't...

652
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,480
be satisfied.

653
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,720
Whether Zheng Lu was innocent or not,

654
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
it was all in the past.

655
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
You and I have no right
to argue about it.

656
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,520
But we mustn't let Zheng Wu's case

657
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,880
end like this.

658
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,480
What do you plan to do?

659
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,920
I plan to investigate.

660
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,960
What are you doing?

661
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,040
I'm just doing this out of kindness.

662
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,680
I didn't expect you

663
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,200
to be good at this.

664
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
As humans,

665
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,640
we were born without a reason,

666
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,680
and we have to live like a coward.

667
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,880
Most times,
we suffer from terrible deaths.

668
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,320
That's why

669
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
I'm helping them out

670
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,080
so that they can go for reincarnation
with a beautiful face.

671
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,200
I hope that they won't
become humans in the future.

672
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,560
Is becoming a human

673
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,360
a bad thing?

674
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,360
As for that,

675
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,240
you should know that the best.

676
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,240
Wu,

677
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll bring you home now.

678
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,360
Wu!

679
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,840
I'll bring you home now!

680
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,000
(Violet Bureau)

681
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,640
What happened?

682
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,840
Wu was the daughter of Zheng Lu.

683
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,560
She has committed suicide.

684
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,400
His Majesty has closed the case.

685
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,640
She's Zheng Lu's daughter?

686
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,640
They said Zheng Lu was a traitor.

687
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,960
But Aunt,

688
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,760
I remember you told me

689
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,600
that loyal court officials

690
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,640
were the ones who died
during the Morning Dew Rebellion, right?

691
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,720
Since His Majesty has closed the case,

692
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,120
you should just leave it there.

693
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,520
It's meaningless for you

694
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,920
to continue the investigation.

695
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,920
It's not meaningless.

696
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,640
What do you plan to do?

697
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,920
Don't tell me you want to help
Zheng Lu prove his innocence?

698
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,080
I need to know who's the mastermind

699
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,840
behind Wu's assassination attempt.

700
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,960
Eight years ago,

701
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,480
when the Zheng Family was massacred,

702
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,040
Wu was only 12 years old

703
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,280
back then.

704
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
So how did she escape the massacre

705
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,640
and how did she enter the palace?

706
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,440
Records and files about her background

707
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,960
are too perfect for her situation.

708
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,400
This doesn't make sense at all.

709
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,600
What do you suspect?

710
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,520
I suspect that
someone was controlling her.

711
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,000
I suspect that someone
forced her to do so.

712
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,160
We could only close the case

713
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,680
after we found the mastermind.

714
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,360
His Majesty

715
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
is a villain.

716
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,760
100 bolts of fabric?

717
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,960
A petty person like him

718
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,080
is actually an important court official?

719
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,800
Take them down.

720
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,040
Yes, Your Majesty!

721
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,720
Hold it right there!

722
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,520
Stop!

723
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,960
Let her go.

724
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,520
Aunt,

725
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,800
Zheng Lu was maligned.

726
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,720
And the person who had maligned him

727
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,080
was none other than Duke Chu

728
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,120
and His Majesty.

729
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,480
Am I right?

730
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
After the Morning Dew Rebellion,

731
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,440
Zheng Lu, together with
several court officials,

732
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,240
tried to assassinate Qiu Ziliang.

733
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,160
But they failed to do so.

734
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,200
Qiu Ziliang was enraged because of that.

735
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,760
He massacred

736
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,080
everyone that was involved.

737
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,600
His Majesty

738
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,880
was the godson of Qiu Ziliang back then.

739
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,600
He was an important subject to him.

740
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,600
He massacred the Zheng Family
with his own hands.

741
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,480
Because of that,

742
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,400
Qiu Ziliang assisted him
to be the emperor

743
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,040
after the late emperor
passed away from sickness.

744
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,200
The person I'm protecting right now

745
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
is actually a crook like him.

746
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,920
But this has nothing to do with us.

747
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,800
The mission of the Violet Bureau

748
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,440
is to protect our emperor.

749
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,880
Now,

750
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,040
Qiu Ziliang has the largest influence
within the imperial court.

751
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,040
His Majesty was forced
to do his bidding.

752
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,760
He deserved it.

753
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,040
Yu'er,

754
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
when it comes to politics,

755
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,880
there's no right or wrong.

756
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,400
You just need to remember this.

757
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
His Majesty has the surname Qi.

758
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,240
He's the rightful heir to the throne.

759
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
He's the official emperor.

760
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,360
But he's a tyrant.

761
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,760
He was the one who forced

762
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,280
Wu to a dead corner!

763
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,000
Yu'er,

764
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,360
the Sword Bearer doesn't need to think.

765
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,040
Right or wrong

766
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,800
doesn't matter to the Sword Bearer.

767
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,080
Where the emperor points to

768
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,880
is where your sword will head to.

769
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,400
Aunt,

770
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,080
The Sword Bearer's mission

771
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,120
is to protect the emperor.

772
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,840
But I'm more than just the Sword Bearer.

773
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm Cheng Ruoyu as well.

774
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,040
Wu is my friend.

775
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,320
I want her

776
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,600
to leave this world in a beautiful way.
