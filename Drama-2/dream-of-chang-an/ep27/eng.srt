14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
I'll teach her a lesson

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
for you instead.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,760
I assure you your niece will

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,600
behave

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,960
and obey,

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
and be more sensible.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
I wouldn't dare to trouble you.

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
I should lecture her myself.

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,760
It's no big deal.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
That settles it.

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,040
Guards.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,240
Escort Madam Cheng and her ladies back.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,960
Madam Cheng.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,760
This way.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,080
Little Fish!

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Your Majesty!

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,480
Your Majesty!

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,080
Your Majesty!

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,600
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,680
It's...

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
It's Qiu Yanzhi. She...

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,760
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,600
Why are you here?

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
I have good news

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,280
and bad news.

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Which would you like to know first?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,720
The good news.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Come in.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
I thought

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
I would never see you again.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,200
It's all right now.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm here.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,560
It's over.

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm here for you.

51
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,959
What about the bad news?

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,240
Can't you tell?

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
It was Yu'er who rescued her.

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Your Majesty's loyal Sword Bearer

55
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,360
sacrificed her own life

56
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
to save Princess Misha's life.

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,280
Isn't this touching?

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Do you know...

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
that I found you interesting

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,680
when I first met you?

62
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
However,

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
you've spoiled my plan

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,640
time and time again.

65
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,640
Yet, I didn't take your life.

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,320
Do you know why?

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
It's because of loyalty.

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
It's hard to come by nowadays

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,480
here in Xing.

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
But I'm well aware

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,200
that you are loyal only to Qi Yan.

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,120
For me,

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,320
your loyalty

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
is a nuisance.

75
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,280
Now that you know,

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
then cut me to the quick.

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
Lovely.

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,400
Dying is

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,040
the easiest thing to do.

80
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,080
Taking your life

81
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
is my mercy for you.

82
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
Do you get it?

83
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Lovely girl.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,200
Tell me,

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,520
what happened between

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,840
you and Cheng Xi?

87
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,040
If Cheng Xi

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
wanted to side with me,

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,720
she would have done it.

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,200
But why is she

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,680
betraying Qi Yan right now?

92
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,200
And curiously, Qi Yan didn't punish her.

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,560
You, Cheng Xi, and Qi Yan,

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,840
the three of you,

95
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,720
must be planning something.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,640
Come on.

97
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,000
Come clean.

98
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,720
Are you playing dead?

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,040
Right Advisor.

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Yes.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
Make sure you teach her a good lesson.

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,320
Yes.

103
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Your Majesty.

104
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Your Majesty.

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Majesty, you must be cautious.

106
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
You're still recovering.

107
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
Is everything set?

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,240
Yes.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
We can't afford the slightest mistake.

110
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
I need you to get rid of

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
Shi Yuan and Yuan Xing personally.

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Very well.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,760
The field is set.

114
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
We have one chance

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
for victory.

116
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,600
In all my years here,

117
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
you're the most talented

118
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,760
martial artist I've seen.

119
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,200
But sadly,

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,480
when the Right Advisor is done
breaking all your bones,

121
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
you're as good as nothing.

122
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,640
Dismissed.

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Yes.

124
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
Do you feel pity for her?

125
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,000
No.

126
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Yu'er was arrogant

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
to go against you and thwart your plans.

128
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
She deserved to be punished.

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
However,

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
we have never

131
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
kept any secrets from you.

132
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,440
We need your wise judgment.

133
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
Whether the intention was ill or not,

134
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
some interrogations will do the trick.

135
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,960
Even now, I have yet

136
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
to earn your trust.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
In that case,

138
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
for your ease of mind,

139
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
I request

140
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,040
that you spare my life

141
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
and let me resign

142
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,800
for I have returned

143
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
Princess Misha and Prince An.

144
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
I will never step into Heng'an again.

145
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
No.

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
You're an outstanding official.

147
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,920
I could never let you leave.

148
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Get up.

149
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,280
Sir!

150
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,520
Sir! His Majesty is coming.

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,920
If you want me

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,000
to trust you,

153
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
there is only one way.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,600
You must

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
take your niece's life
right in front of Qi Yan.

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,240
Only then

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,320
will I believe

158
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
you are truly on my side

159
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
and not putting up an act

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
to help Qi Yan.

161
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,920
His Majesty arrives!

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Your Majesty.

163
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
I am not expecting this visit.

164
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,080
Why?

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,400
You should be healing
inside your palace.

166
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Wait here.

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,240
Yes.

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,480
What are you waiting for?

169
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,120
Don't you want me to trust you?

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
I've given you

171
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
the opportunity.

172
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,360
Madam Cheng.

173
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,840
Madam Cheng, no.

174
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,120
- No!
- It's either her

175
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,480
or me.

176
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,160
Your Majesty.

177
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm here.

178
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,920
It's all right now.

179
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,080
Don't speak.

180
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,960
Is Your Majesty going to defend her?

181
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,080
What has the Sword Bearer done

182
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
to deserve your wrath,

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Godfather?

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,520
It's the middle of the night.

185
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,960
She trespassed my house

186
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,400
like an assassin.

187
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
So we interrogated her.

188
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Am I right,

189
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,520
Madam Cheng?

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,520
Yes.

191
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,320
The nation has its laws.

192
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
A house needs rules.

193
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
Duke Chu merely enforced the laws.

194
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Is that so?

195
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,360
But the Sword Bearer

196
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,560
was ordered by me

197
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,040
to quell the traitors.

198
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,160
Your Majesty, do you mean

199
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,720
I am the traitor?

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,520
Don't you remember?

201
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,640
You stabbed me.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
I was lecturing Yu'er.

203
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,920
I didn't expect Your Majesty
to stand out for her.

204
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
I have since resigned

205
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,520
and left the palace.

206
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,480
I didn't agree with it.

207
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
I had permission

208
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
from Duke Chu.

209
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,760
It was informed to the six Bureaus.

210
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Indeed.

211
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
She is telling the truth.

212
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,120
Very well.

213
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
Since Duke Chu

214
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,400
has punished you,

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
then this matter is over.

216
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
I will not pursue further action.

217
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,440
Guards.

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,160
Take the Sword Bearer
back to the palace.

219
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,320
No.

220
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,120
Yu'er trespassed

221
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
into Duke Chu's house.

222
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,000
She even killed three members
of the Violet Bureau.

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
She murdered them.

224
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,560
Your Majesty

225
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,520
should not defend her.

226
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,800
Are you telling the truth?

227
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,280
Li Rong.

228
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,000
Bring in their bodies.

229
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
What are you waiting for?

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,720
Get it done now!

231
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Yes.

232
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,160
Your Majesty.

233
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
The laws make no exception
for the ruler.

234
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Cheng Ruoyu came on

235
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
behalf of Your Majesty,

236
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,680
but she could have just arrested me.

237
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
She shouldn't have killed
those innocent people.

238
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I didn't kill them.

239
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,320
You did.

240
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
I have witnesses and evidence.

241
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,200
Aunt...

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,280
I am not your aunt.

243
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,600
I told you,

244
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
you and I are no longer family.

245
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,200
Don't be afraid.

246
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm here for you.

247
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,520
Tell His Majesty

248
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,160
who killed these girls.

249
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,720
It was Cheng Ruoyu.

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,400
Your Majesty.

251
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,040
This sword

252
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,760
was taken

253
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
from their bodies.

254
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Your Majesty, the laws come first.

255
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
Your Majesty.

256
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
This case

257
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
should be handled
by the Court of Judicature

258
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,280
per the laws.

259
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Sir,

260
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
may I know

261
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,840
what is the punishment

262
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
for killing three people

263
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
according to our laws?

264
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,320
Death sentence

265
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,600
and execution.

266
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,400
Cheng Ruoyu,

267
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,120
I've prepared everything

268
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,040
on my end.

269
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
Now, it's down to you

270
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,200
to take the final action.

271
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,480
(I need the map of
Qiu Ziliang's residence,)

272
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,240
(my aunt's location,)

273
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,320
(and)

274
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,920
(your help.)

275
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Very well.

276
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,360
You must do as I say.

277
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,040
What is it?

278
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
I'll send Yan Xiu with you.

279
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,280
Draw Cheng Xi's attention

280
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
after your successful infiltration.

281
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,520
Yan Xiu will use the opening

282
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,720
to rescue Liu Misha.

283
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,800
Sure.

284
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,080
However,

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
you will face two obstacles.

286
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,200
First,

287
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,640
Cheng Xi will try to harm you.

288
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,720
Secondly,

289
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,920
Cheng Xi might spare your life,

290
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
but your action in the residence

291
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,839
will never escape Qiu Ziliang's sight.

292
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,240
So he will take your life.

293
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,599
If I can bring Princess Misha back,

294
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,880
I don't mind the risk.

295
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
Now is not the time

296
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,680
to trade your life for hers.

297
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
After you've saved her,

298
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I'll take her to Qi Yan immediately.

299
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,200
He will rush to Qiu Ziliang's house

300
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,600
to save you.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
But

302
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,160
Qiu Ziliang will never obey His Majesty.

303
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
That is why

304
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,560
I've found you

305
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,360
a lifesaver.

306
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,800
What if

307
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
the sinner was expecting a child?

308
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,560
What did you say?

309
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm expecting a child.

310
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
According to the laws,

311
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,440
a woman on death roll

312
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,920
must be executed.

313
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,440
But she is expecting a child,

314
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,040
the execution can only be carried out

315
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
100 days after she's given birth.

316
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
Isn't that right?

317
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,560
What was that?

318
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
You're pregnant?

319
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,760
Yes.

320
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Do you not believe me?

321
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,960
It's impossible.

322
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,440
This is not possible!

323
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Who is the father?

324
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,960
His Majesty.

325
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,600
How I came by

326
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
this imaginary child aside,

327
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
Qiu Ziliang would have

328
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,040
more reasons to take my life

329
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,040
because I was pregnant

330
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,720
with His Majesty's child.

331
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you want to

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,120
save His Majesty or not?

333
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,440
Do you want to stop

334
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,200
Prince An from becoming
the Crown Prince?

335
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
Of course.

336
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Sir.

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
You asked me

338
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,400
why I had a fallout with my aunt.

339
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,480
Why?

340
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I refused to tell you

341
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
because I still

342
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
held gratitude for her.

343
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,520
But I never thought

344
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,400
she would go as far as to frame me

345
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
just to have me executed.

346
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,680
For the sake of my child,

347
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
I must live.

348
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,120
I was ordered by my aunt

349
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
to approach His Majesty.

350
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
She promised me

351
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,640
she would help my son ascend
to the throne

352
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,120
if I gave birth

353
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,520
to a prince.

354
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,160
But she betrayed me

355
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,720
and took Prince An and Princess Misha

356
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,720
to you.

357
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,760
The 16th of next month

358
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
will be Prince An's

359
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,160
appointment ceremony.

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
I felt angry and slighted.

361
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,880
So I came to confront her

362
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
and a fierce battle almost broke out.

363
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
You liar!

364
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Sir.

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
Do not believe her.

366
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,360
Carry on.

367
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I never thought

368
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,680
she would trick me.

369
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
She used me

370
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,200
to alienate you and His Majesty,

371
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,280
then pretended to lead
the Violet Bureau into serving you.

372
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,360
Do you know what her motive

373
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,320
really is?

374
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,680
She wants the throne to herself.

375
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,080
I bet you haven't realized

376
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
that Liu Misha is still alive.

377
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,200
Really?

378
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,280
My aunt sent Ziyuan

379
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
to impersonate Liu Misha.

380
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
After she murdered Wang Lin,

381
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,360
she escaped with

382
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,800
the real Princess Misha.

383
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,960
She is lying.

384
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,920
Sir,

385
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
she is a liar!

386
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,440
It was a lie!

387
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,960
I can judge whether

388
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,880
she is

389
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
lying or not.

390
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,720
What happened next?

391
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
She wants the throne.

392
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
So she needs an army.

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,520
She took Liu Misha

394
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,000
and seized control of Zhenwu Army's
80,000 soldiers.

395
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,760
With the Violet Bureau
working on the inside,

396
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,240
she will use the appointment ceremony
as the opportunity

397
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,360
to kill you,

398
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
His Majesty,

399
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
and Prince An.

400
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,720
She will kill you all.

401
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
Is it true?

402
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,000
Madam Cheng.

403
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,800
Sir,

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
do you think I could pull that off?

405
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Zhenwu is far from here.

406
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,760
The Violet Bureau has around
only 100 warriors.

407
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,360
We could never pull this off.

408
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,920
Then please,

409
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,280
investigate the three mysteries.

410
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,200
First,

411
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,480
why did Prince An fall ill so suddenly?

412
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,000
Secondly,

413
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,160
is the Zhenwu Army  marching?

414
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Thirdly,

415
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,240
the appointment ceremony is at
the Danfeng Gate.

416
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
Have she already installed traps

417
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,520
beneath the stone staircase?

418
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,960
Guards.

419
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes.

420
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
Investigate immediately.

421
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,160
Yes.

422
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,920
The youngling left his home
for the general of the army.

423
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,160
He wielded his gilded sword and armor
to earn his glory.

424
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,280
Disregarding the freezing cold
that was hurting his steed,

425
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,520
he rode to battle so his nation
could have peace.

426
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,520
Grandfather.

427
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,120
Look.

428
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,440
Daybreak has come.

429
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:43,860
(Hanyuan Hall)

430
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,520
This was your scheme all along.

431
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,760
The reason you came here last night,

432
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,600
and what you did here

433
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
were for this very moment.

434
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,400
No.

435
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,040
I told you.

436
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,520
I am saving my own skin.

437
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,920
Your Majesty.

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,600
Eunuch Qiu.

439
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,920
We are investigating Prince An's condition,

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,440
and waiting for reports on Zhenwu's forces.

441
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
But under the staircase of Danfeng Gate,

442
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,120
there was

443
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
a contraption that was nearly completed.

444
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,600
It contained black powder.

445
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,040
Cheng Xi.

446
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,400
What do you have to say now?

447
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,360
Sir.

448
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
I have only one thing to say.

449
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,560
Speak.

450
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Cheng Ruoyu

451
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,480
was never pregnant.

452
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
She lied.

453
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,080
Very well.

454
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,240
Examine her body.

455
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,960
Leave.

456
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes.

457
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,680
That was too reckless.

458
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm fine.

459
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,520
I mean it.

460
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,320
Your Majesty.

461
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Are the Imperial Physicians here?

462
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
Your Majesty.

463
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,440
We've notified them.

464
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,120
Summon Cheng Huaizhi as well.

465
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,320
And

466
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,120
tell him to bring the chronicle as well.

467
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,080
Yes.

468
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,480
Your Majesty.

469
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,920
Why do you need him here?

470
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,960
My child

471
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
needs a proper background.

472
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,360
Yu'er.

473
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,080
You risked your life to help me.

474
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
I won't let you down.

475
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
No.

476
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,400
I was...

477
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,040
However,

478
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,160
are you sure

479
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,120
you can pass the examination?

480
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,000
We can go now.

481
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,000
Whom did Qiu Ziliang summon?

482
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,200
As you predicted,

483
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
he summoned three groups of people.

484
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,000
Imperial Physicians,

485
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,600
Physician Shen

486
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,680
and a reputable midwife

487
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,920
from outside the palace

488
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,920
named Cui Niang.

489
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,840
Great.

490
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll be there right away.

491
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,800
I count on you to take care
of the other tasks.

492
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,880
Very well.

493
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,520
I will keep Qiu Ziliang

494
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
in his house for 12 hours.

495
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
During that time,

496
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,360
you must get rid of Yuan Xing

497
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
and Shi Yuan.

498
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,880
Can you do it?

499
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,080
I won't let you down, Chess Overseer.

500
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
We work as one.

501
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,740
(Duke Chu's Residence)

502
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

503
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,480
Father.

504
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,600
Have you brought the chronicle with you?

505
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,360
Your Majesty.

506
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,680
Yes.

507
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,300
(The chronicle's record)

508
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,940
(The chronicle's record)

509
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,100
(The chronicle's record)

510
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,657
(Lunar May 7th, the handmaiden Cheng Ruoyu was
tending to His Majesty in Zhaohua Palace.)

511
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:55,580
(She remained in the room
for the rest of the night.)

512
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,940
(The chronicle)

513
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,080
(The chronicle)
Have a look yourself.

514
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,240
Year of Rooster,

515
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,320
Lunar May 7th,

516
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,720
the handmaiden Cheng Ruoyu

517
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,840
was tending to His Majesty
in Zhaohua Palace at night.

518
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,080
She remained in the room
for the rest of the night.

519
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Impossible.

520
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,000
Sir.

521
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,080
This is impossible!

522
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
They made this up!

523
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,880
Sir.

524
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,880
A chronicle cannot contain lies.

525
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,480
The eunuchs and handmaidens
of that shift

526
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,040
can be the witness.

527
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,280
So

528
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,040
the Sword Bearer Cheng Ruoyu

529
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
neglected her duty and seduced
the Emperor.

530
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,960
Sir.

531
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,920
During that time,

532
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,840
His Majesty already

533
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,120
stripped Cheng Ruoyu of her ranks.

534
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,560
She wasn't on duty.

535
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
So she didn't neglect her duty.

536
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,840
Brother.

537
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
What did she promise you?

538
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
(The chronicle)
How could you side with her to set me up!

539
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,780
(The chronicle)

540
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,840
Look at you.

541
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,400
What have you done?

542
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,040
I deserve punishments.

543
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
Your Majesty.

544
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,680
Duke Chu.

545
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,560
Ms. Cheng is indeed

546
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,800
in her third month of pregnancy.

547
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,720
This is not possible!

548
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,960
Sir.

549
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,600
Cheng Ruoyu has bribed

550
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,680
these Imperial Physicians!

551
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
Madam Cheng,

552
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,480
that's a serious accusation.

553
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
Madam Cheng.

554
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,080
My father always listens to
every side of the story.

555
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Come in!

556
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
Your Majesty.

557
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,160
Duke Chu.

558
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,040
This is Cui Niang, a famous midwife

559
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,760
in the city of Heng'an.

560
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,720
You know this gentleman.

561
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Physician Shen.

562
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm relieved

563
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
to see you here.

564
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,520
Please check

565
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,320
if the girl in that room

566
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
is indeed pregnant.

567
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,180
(Imperial Physician Shen)

568
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,760
They broke your bones.

569
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,280
Lady.

570
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,840
Please take this pill.

571
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,880
Water.

572
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Here.

573
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,640
Lady,

574
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,760
have some water.

575
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,280
Qiu Ziliang

576
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,679
will have the physicians
read your pulse.

577
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,520
Physician Shen will be one of them.

578
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,520
He's served Qiu Ziliang for 40 years.

579
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
Qiu Ziliang trusts him.

580
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,480
Can you buy off Physician Shen?

581
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,120
No.

582
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,880
But fortunately,

583
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,840
you know martial art.

584
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,760
Those who master martial arts
have extraordinary control

585
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,600
over their bodies.

586
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,600
Yan Xiu will show you

587
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,639
how to fake your pulse
so that it seems like

588
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,159
you're pregnant.

589
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,800
Would it work?

590
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,440
Whether it would work or not

591
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,800
depends on your mastery of martial arts.

592
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,320
I'm afraid His Majesty

593
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,840
might lose a child.

594
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,680
Chess Overseer.

595
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
That was rude of me.

596
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,760
I apologize, Your Majesty.

597
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
(This old physician)

598
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,480
(is a kind person.)

599
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
(But sadly...)

600
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,880
Your Majesty, Duke Chu.

601
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,240
The girl's pulse is smooth and flush.

602
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,320
It was as smooth as a pearl.

603
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,080
She is indeed pregnant with a child.

604
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,880
Physician Shen.

605
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,360
How could you...

606
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,400
(Did Yu'er and Qi Yan actually...)

607
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
(If that was the case,)

608
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
(it'd work in my favor.)

609
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,840
(But the timing isn't right.)

610
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,800
However,

611
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,280
judging by her pulse,

612
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
she should be

613
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,320
into the fourth month

614
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
of her pregnancy.

615
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,120
Lunar May 7th...

616
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,120
The time doesn't match.

617
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,720
It happened less than
three months from now.

618
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,760
Physician Shen,

619
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,720
are you certain?

620
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
This

621
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,120
concerns the fate of several lives.

622
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,640
The girl was severely injured.

623
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,520
It's possible that her pulse
isn't reflecting her health.

624
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,640
To make a more precise diagnosis,

625
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,040
we need to conduct a pregnancy test.

626
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,440
I'll leave it to Cui Niang.

627
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,000
My lords,

628
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,760
I am at your service.

629
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,840
Do it now.

630
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,600
If there is any mistake,

631
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,800
you know what will happen.

632
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,640
Yes.

633
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
The Chamberlain will hire

634
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,520
a midwife from the city
to conduct a pregnancy test.

635
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,080
What do we do then?

636
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,880
Don't worry.

637
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
Whoever they hire,

638
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,160
only the person I hire

639
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
will show up.

640
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,440
So I have nothing to worry about.

641
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,360
Chess Overseer.

642
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,240
Father.

643
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,640
Leave it there.

644
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
Please allow me to relieve myself.

645
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,440
Yu.

646
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,400
Did you do

647
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
as Duke Chu ordered?

648
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,080
Chess Overseer,

649
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
we didn't get the midwife.

650
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,240
What?

651
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,600
Our men were going

652
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
to intercept her on the way

653
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
and swap her out.

654
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,200
But they were too late.

655
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,240
But...

656
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,560
The midwife in the room...

657
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,520
She is the real Cui Niang.

658
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,480
Her injury is terrible.

659
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,880
I leave it to you, madam.

660
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,360
It's all right.

661
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,040
Lady.

662
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I'm sorry if I offend you.

663
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,440
- I'll start examining now.
- Very well.

664
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,160
What's so funny?

665
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,760
Don't be so tense, Madam Cheng.

666
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,240
Relax a little.

667
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,360
Our midwife is certainly

668
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,680
reliable and trustworthy.

669
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,880
Sir.

670
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Could I supervise the examination?

671
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,120
No.

672
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,880
Yu'er is severely wounded.

673
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,080
Cui Niang can't defend herself.

674
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,520
If you went in there

675
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,000
and attacked them...

676
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,120
I will not

677
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,040
harm any of them.

678
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Sir...

679
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I will not allow it.

680
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,320
Father.

681
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Please allow me to check on them.

682
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,760
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

683
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
I don't know any martial art.

684
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
I can't harm them.

685
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
Don't you worry, Madam Cheng.

686
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,200
I won't favor Cheng Ruoyu.

687
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,800
I wouldn't be so sure.

688
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,840
What?

689
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,280
Don't you trust my people?

690
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,320
I wouldn't dare.

691
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,960
Yanzhi.

692
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,680
Go in and check.

693
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Yes.
