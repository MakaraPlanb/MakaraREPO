What are you doing?

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,640
I'm just a useless person.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,160
I won't be a threat

17
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
to Qiu Yanzhi.

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Why won't you spare me?

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
Because you know

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,000
something you shouldn't.

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,520
You mean...

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
Yu'er.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,560
Aunt.

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,160
Aunt.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,680
Come on.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,760
Let's go.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
Hurry.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
- Aunt.
- I can't run anymore.

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
You go ahead.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
Why are they chasing after you?

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,240
You shouldn't know

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
so that Yanzhi won't...

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
Yanzhi won't harm me.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,840
Sit down and rest for a while then.

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Yu'er.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll only tell you one thing.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm not a good person indeed.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,720
But Qiu Yanzhi

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,800
is worse than me.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,320
You already know

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
what I want to do.

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,480
But do you know what Qiu Yanzhi

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
wants to do?

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Cheng Xi!

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,200
Yan Xiu.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,200
Aunt.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,640
What are you doing?

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
She has evil intentions towards you.

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't let her go with you.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
I can be the judge of that.

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,640
Wang Ruoling.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
Don't let her fool you.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
I'll go with you.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,200
Spare her.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,040
Aunt.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm already a useless person.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm just living an ignoble existence.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
But you're different.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,120
Yan Xiu, I'm begging you.

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Spare her.

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Let her go.

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,640
Aunt.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
None of you can leave.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,400
Yu'er.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Go.

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,360
Ruoling!

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
Aunt.

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,640
Aunt.

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,080
Aunt.

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Aunt.

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,840
Well...

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Aunt.

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Aunt.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,640
Yan Xiu.

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,040
Why?

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
She did it herself.

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,800
Why

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
won't you let me go?

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,000
I've already left.

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm not a threat to you anymore!

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
Why do you have

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
to keep forcing me?

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,480
I...

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Aunt.

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,000
Aunt.

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
Save her first.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,320
Aunt.

88
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Take the medicine first.

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Yu'er.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
Don't trust him.

91
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
He and Qiu Yanzhi...

92
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
Don't talk first.

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
I know.

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Take the medicine first.

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
Listen to me.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,080
Yu'er.

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,440
I didn't know

99
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
that Qiu Yanzhi would kill Li Rong.

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,200
If I knew

101
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,400
I wouldn't have sent her.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
I know.

103
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,640
I wrote another copy on the silk cloth

104
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,280
just in case.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,880
All right.

106
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,960
Take the medicine first all right?

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
Yu'er.

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,560
Listen to me.

109
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,080
Actually...

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,800
Actually you're really like me.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
We were both born
into prestigious families

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,080
and were pampered and loved.

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,480
However, everything changed in one day.

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Our entire clan was killed.

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
But you and I are different.

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
I made

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,680
treacherous plans.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,320
Even...

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
Even my own brother

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
wouldn't help me.

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
But you're different.

122
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
You're kind-hearted

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
and magnanimous.

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
You're like another version of me.

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,160
Aunt.

126
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Hatred didn't consume your conscience.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,480
Aunt.

128
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,200
Yu'er.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
You must live well.

130
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
You have to live well.

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Qiu Yanzhi has a big conspiracy.

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
She even

133
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,480
mesmerized my brother

134
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,240
to help her ascend to the throne.

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
That was why he betrayed me.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
believe her.

138
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,320
Never believe her.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Aunt.

140
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,000
Aunt.

141
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Aunt!

142
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,560
I'm sorry Aunt.

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Aunt.

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,240
No.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
She's dead?

146
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Yes.

147
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,640
Nice Cheng Xi.

148
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
She's Cheng Xi indeed.

149
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
She used her life

150
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,080
to sow discord among the Wang sisters.

151
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
I respect her.

152
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
Since she's so good

153
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,760
I must do well too.

154
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,480
Yanzhi.

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,919
Just wait.

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,480
I'll let you know

157
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,040
what heart-wrenching
anguish really feels like.

Aunt.

my identity,

160
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,800
purposely sent me

to His Majesty's side,

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,120
did so many bad things,

163
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
lied to me,

164
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
and hid things from me,

165
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,200
now

166
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,320

195
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Once this imperial edict is out,

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
many people in the military

197
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,480
will surely feel unhappy.

198
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
Only if they're unhappy

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,960
can we get an opportunity
to take advantage.

200
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,560
You mean...

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,320
In the past three years,

202
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,760
eunuchs took most of the military pay
and provisions.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Qiu Ziliang also can't prove
his innocence.

204
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,240
And the way he forcibly suppressed
the soldiers before

205
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,600
also caused a lot of fear

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,680
and dissatisfaction among them.

207
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
It's been accumulating for so long.

208
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,680
It's time to explode.

209
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
How?

210
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
They'll direct their anger at me.

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
Only if they do that

212
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,000
can I bring back the soldier's morale

213
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,160
and rebuild imperial power.

214
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,080
And just like you said

215
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,120
in this game

216
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,520
I must openly play

217
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
with Qiu Ziliang.

218
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,880
(Danfeng Gate)
Return our pay and provisions!

219
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
- Return our pay and provisions!
- Return our pay and provisions!

220
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,640
How dare you take
our pay and provisions!

221
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,520
- Return our pay and provisions!
- Return our pay and provisions!

222
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,000
How dare you take
our pay and provisions!

223
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,920
Return the money to us!

224
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,470
(Danfeng Gate)

225
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,800
Sir.

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,960
Do you know

227
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,640
what's going on there?

228
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,680
The Chancellor wants to reduce
military pay and provisions.

229
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
The soldiers are protesting

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
and arguing in front of the gate.

231
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
Nowadays

232
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,280
soldiers

233
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
are so bold.

234
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,320
They're even daring to ask the emperor
for an explanation.

235
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,000
- Return our pay and provisions!
- Return our pay and provisions!

236
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
- Return our pay and provisions!
- Return our pay and provisions!

237
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,760
- Return our pay and provisions!
- Return our pay and provisions!

238
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,560
(Han Ding.)

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,840
(What's going on?)

240
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,240
(This won't do.)

241
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
(I must return to the palace at once.)

242
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,440
Your Majesty.

243
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,240
I bring what you wanted.

244
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
Consort Shu.

245
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,760
Check it out.

246
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Yes.

247
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
I deserve to die.

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,080
Huaizhi.

249
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Capture it.

250
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,360
Why?

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,560
Why is there a cat?

252
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,160
It's for Grand Empress Dowager
to relieve her tiredness.

253
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,240
Don't move.

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,680
Stay still.

255
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,620
(Command Token)

256
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Report to Eunuch

257
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,600
that Cheng Ruoyu is back.

258
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,240
Yes.

259
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,480
The show is about to start.

260
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,600
You're afraid of cats?

261
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,520
A person's appearance might change.

262
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,000
Her personality

263
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
and voice might change.

264
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,400
But the innate physique

265
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
she was born with

266
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
cannot be changed at all.

267
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,320
When you see cats

268
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
you'll itch all over.

269
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
And you'll get rashes if you touch it,

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,880
right?

271
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
Wang Ruoqing.

272
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Come on.

273
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
I'll help you up.

274
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,120
Your Majesty.

275
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Ruoling.

276
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,920
Why are you back?

277
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,600
You can't be here.

278
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Didn't...

279
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
Didn't Xiu find you?

280
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,480
Aunt is dead.

281
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
He died from Yan Xiu's sword.

282
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
I didn't tell Xiu to kill her.

283
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
Ruoyu there must be a misunderstanding.

284
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,040
Then tell me.

285
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,480
What is the misunderstanding?

286
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,480
No matter what it is

287
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
I can explain.

288
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
We can't talk here.

289
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Let's go somewhere else.

290
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,960
Chess Overseer you're prophetic.

291
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,280
She fell into the trap herself indeed.

292
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,640
You little cat.

293
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,480
It was so hard to capture you.

294
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm exhausted.

295
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,720
When we're back...

296
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,640
This is bad.

297
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,440
I should have guessed.

298
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,720
You kept calling him

299
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,080
Uncle Han Yue.

300
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Yet you sold him out to Qiu Ziliang.

301
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,440
You said that you wanted
to help me and His Majesty.

302
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Yet you just want to become queen.

303
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,359
Today

304
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm going to kill you on Aunt's behalf.

305
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,640
Ruoyu.

306
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,359
Your Majesty.

307
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,119
I can't believe
that you're protecting her.

308
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Guards!

309
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
This is bad.

310
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,960
This is a rebellion.

311
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Where are the Jinwu Guards?

312
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Where are the Jinwu Guards?

313
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,800
This is a rebellion.

314
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
This is a rebellion!

315
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Where are the Jinwu Guards?

316
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Where are the Jinwu Guards?

317
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Stop!

318
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,120
This girl barged into the palace

319
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
to assassinate Consort Shu.

320
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,800
She's unforgivable!

321
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,440
Let Consort Shu go.

322
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
We haven't captured the assassin.

323
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,560
I don't dare to disregard
Her Highness's

324
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,960
and your safety.

325
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,040
Capture her.

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,360
Who dares to do that?

327
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Who dares to do that?

328
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,480
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness!

329
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,000
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness!

330
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness!

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness!

332
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,480
Protect His Majesty and Her Highness!

333
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
Get Chess Overseer treated.

334
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Let's go.

335
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,400
Your Majesty.

336
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
You may all go.

337
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

338
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,080
Hurry.

339
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,920
Yu'er.

340
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,280
Don't point your sword

341
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,080
at Yanzhi again.

342
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,880
Because...

343
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Because she's...

344
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,480
Who exactly is she?

345
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,600
Who exactly is she?

346
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,320
(She's Wang Ruoqing)

347
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,720
(your elder sister.)

348
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,560
Your Majesty.

349
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
You still

350
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,160
don't trust me,

351
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,840
right?

352
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
Yu'er.

353
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
In this world

354
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,040
you're the one I trust the most.

355
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
Be calm in thinking about things.

356
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,800
Regarding Yanzhi,

357
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,840
after I investigate clearly,

358
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
I'll surely tell you everything.

359
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,520
But you can't stay here for long.

360
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
You must leave immediately.

361
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,640
Huaizhi.

362
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,360
Huaizhi.

363
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
Yes.

364
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Take Yu'er away from here.

365
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,800
Yes.

366
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Trust me.

367
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,440
(I see.)

368
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,520
(He wants the sisters)

369
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,160
(to kill each other.)

370
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
(Qiu Ziliang)

371
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,160
(may have made this move,)

372
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
(but you must be
the mastermind behind it,)

373
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,920
(Uncle.)

374
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Uncle.

375
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,160
Why did you do that?

376
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
What exactly do you want?

377
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,120
When is this going to end?

378
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
Qiu Ziliang is already out
of isolated meditation.

379
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
If you don't leave now,
you can't leave anymore.

380
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Qiu Ziliang is out
of isolated meditation?

381
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,400
That's why you must be extra careful.

382
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,000
Go.

383
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,040
Your plan is brilliant.

384
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Wang Ruoqing is utterly dispirited now.

385
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,600
This is just the beginning.

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,640
I've already sent people

387
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
to watch that carriage.

388
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Wang Ruoling's every move

389
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
is under our control.

390
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
What should we do next?

391
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Continue

392
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,440
the heart-wrenching battle

393
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,840
until death.

394
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,040
What if Chess Overseer
can't take it anymore

395
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,760
and tells her

396
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,920
that they're sisters?

397
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,520
Don't forget.

398
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,800
When we were about to kill
Han Yue back then,

399
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,480
Yanzhi also pretended
to be Wang Ruoqing.

400
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,320
You can't tell a lot of lies indeed.

401
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,080
Otherwise when you speak the truth

402
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
no one would believe you.

403
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,320
Yes.

404
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Come.

405
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,520
Take a look.

406
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,520
Look at my pigeons.

407
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
They're all so fat.

408
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,800
By the way,

409
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,360
how are things on Li Deyun's side?

410
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,160
He'll soon find out

411
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,040
the consequences of being your enemy.

412
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,640
Thank you for your hard work.

413
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,480
I won't have any regret even if I die
serving you.

414
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
Father.

415
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
Qiu Ziliang is placing the blame on you

416
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
for reducing military pay
and provisions.

417
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,440
He's saying that you instigated
His Majesty to do it.

418
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,040
Now hundreds of soldiers

419
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,840
are causing trouble in front
of Danfeng Gate.

420
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,800
When foolish people cause a riot,

421
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,680
it's not trivial.

422
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm worried about your safety.

423
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,640
Rest at home today.

424
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,480
The official documents are all piled up.

425
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
If I don't go,

426
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
it will delay things.

427
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,000
Besides, His Majesty knows what to do.

428
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,640
Father.

429
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,240
Ning'er.

430
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,520
If something

431
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
really happens to me,

432
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
return to Lingnan.

433
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,680
Don't ever come back.

434
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Father.

435
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,080
You'll surely win.

436
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,560
Evil cannot win against good.

437
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
Don't worry.

438
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,920
Father.

439
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,250
(Brocade Shop)

440
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,280
We lost her.

441
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,480
I'll continue searching.

442
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,160
Go and report to Chess Overseer first.

443
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,440
All right.

444
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,680
Tell me.

445
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,560
What is Chess Overseer's objective?

446
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,720
Tell me!

447
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
Chess Overseer didn't tell us.

448
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,640
However,

449
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,320
I vaguely heard about a posthumous edict

450
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,520
from Left Advisor.

451
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,280
We really don't know many things.

452
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,520
Scram!

453
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,840
You may go.

454
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
Qiu Ziliang

455
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,000
already knew

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,160
your real identity.

457
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,920
Now I know as well.

458
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,160
That means

459
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,160
only Ruoling,

460
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,840
your sister,

461
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,120
still doesn't know about this now.

462
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,960
Qiu Ziliang

463
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,080
obviously wants

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,560
you two to kill each other.

465
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,200
The later you tell her,

466
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,040
the more painful it will be for Ruoling
after she finds out.

467
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
He wants to see Ruoling break down.

468
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,800
I definitely won't give him
what he wants.

469
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
Besides,

470
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
if I tell her now,

471
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,680
she wouldn't believe me anymore.

472
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,440
Your sister

473
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,960
is much calmer and wiser

474
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,000
than you think.

475
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,680
How did you know that
she wouldn't believe you?

476
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,240
I don't want her to know.

477
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,480
My hands are stained with blood.

478
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,560
It's all because

479
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
I wronged you two back then.

480
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,800
Then

481
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,680
promise me this.

482
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,160
What?

483
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,680
If Ruoling really kills me,

484
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,240
don't tell her either.

485
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
This is my last wish.

486
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,400
I hope that she'll always

487
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,040
be proud of her family.

488
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,880
The Wang clan in Heng'an

489
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,320
is firm, unyielding

490
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
and loyal.

491
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,000
There's no sinner

492
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
like me.

493
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,400
I promise.

494
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,840
You want to ask me about Yanzhi?

495
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,480
Regarding Yanzhi

496
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
I'll investigate clearly.

497
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,960
You created trouble
by Danfeng Gate today.

498
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,200
Was that according
to His Majesty's wishes?

499
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,560
No comment.

500
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,400
People were creating trouble
in Danfeng Gate.

501
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
As Chancellor, Official Li Deyun

502
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
will surely go and pacify them.

503
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,320
This matter

504
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
is related to Official Li Deyun.

505
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,920
Qiu Ziliang

506
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,600
wants to harm Official Li Deyun.

507
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,520
That's why

508
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,040
His Majesty's objective this time

509
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
is to kill Qiu Ziliang.

510
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,560
Cheng Ruoyu.

511
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,960
You're becoming like His Majesty
more and more.

512
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,800
It's just that...

513
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,840
It's just that what?

514
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,320
It's just that when Official Li
goes there,

515
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,800
Qiu Ziliang

516
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,960
will surely make a move.

517
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,960
When the time comes

518
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,400
and something happens in the chaos,

519
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
Official Li's life would be in danger.

520
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,840
I have a plan

521
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
that can keep him safe.

522
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,800
Han Ding.

523
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,360
Help me inform His Majesty

524
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,960
that I, Cheng Ruoyu,

525
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,720
will forever be his Sword Bearer.

526
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,040
You may go.

527
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,680
Yes.

528
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,200
It seems like
the divine healer's medicine

529
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,400
is useful indeed.

530
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

531
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,040
Ruoling is still soft-hearted.

532
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,120
Your Majesty.

533
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,120
Cheng Ruoyu already knew

534
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
the plan for the trouble
by Danfeng Gate.

535
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,520
She said that she had a fool-proof plan

536
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,960
to ensure that no one would get harmed.

537
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
She spoke so confidently.

538
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,640
She even told me to inform you

539
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,840
that she

540
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
would always be your Sword Bearer.

541
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,000
Cooperate with her.

542
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,920
Follow the original plan

543
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,280
and lead the soldiers to Danfeng Gate.

544
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,560
Yes.

545
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Your Majesty, there's one more thing.

546
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,440
For Chess of Generals Camp's
Golden Chess Pieces,

547
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000
aside from Left Chariot,

548
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,520
the others including Prince Guang

549
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,040
are all locked in the dungeon.

550
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,200
The soldiers are fine?

551
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
The soldiers never listen to people,
but the Seal.

552
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,280
That means

553
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,720
Qiu Ziliang has all the authority now?

554
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,960
Yes.

555
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,520
What do you think?

556
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,520
It's a big crisis.

557
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
Yet it's also a big opportunity.

558
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,960
It seems like you've also
figured it out.

559
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
For the Shencai Army
and Chess of Generals Camp,

560
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
there are no generals
in the middle level.

561
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,280
Even if Qiu Ziliang has the authority,

562
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,159
he surely can't manage them.

563
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
He'll surely send a new leader.

564
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,070
(Chess of Generals Camp)

565
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,620
(Chess of Generals Camp)

566
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,719
Qiu Ziliang didn't take it?

567
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,440
Mine was taken away.

568
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,199
Then this one is...

569
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,280
I stole Left Chariot's.

570
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,480
This is great.

571
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,880
With this token,

572
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,040
we can substitute

573
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,840
those on our side for
the Golden Chess Pieces.

577

Now,

600
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,200
you're the one managing Violet Bureau?

601
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,440
Madam Jade.

602
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,960
I want to eliminate
the eunuch's faction.

603
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Are you willing to help me?

604
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,080
My name is Wang Ruoling.

605
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,560
I'm Wang Yang's descendant.

606
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
In the Morning Dew Rebellion,

607
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,520
the entire Wang clan was eliminated.

608
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,600
Before,

609
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
I never knew anything about
this enmity of family and nation.

610
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,520
I lived muddle-headedly for many years.

611
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,680
But it's different now.

612
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,520
I want to clear my grandfather's name.

613
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,120
I need you.

614
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,880
I need the entire Violet Bureau.

615
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,640
This sword...

616
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,080
I'm Wang Ruoling.

617
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm the Sword Bearer of Violet Bureau.

618
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,200
You're willing to help me?

619
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,680
You mean

620
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,080
you want to save His Highness
Prince Guang first?

621
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,000
Madam Jade.

622
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm willing to help you.

623
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,240
Together let us eliminate
the wicked people

624
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,920
as well the evil officials
beside His Majesty.

625
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Qiu Ziliang

626
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,120
wants to choose new Golden Chess Pieces.

627
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,920
I know that this is an opportunity.

628
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,360
But on the day he chooses them,

629
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,880
Qiu Ziliang will surely
take great precautions

630
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,640
against people who'll try to save him.

631
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,400
We need to carefully plan

632
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,760
how to save Prince Guang.

633
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,360
We can't be rash.

634
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,320
It seems like
the divine healer's prescription

635
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
is effective indeed.

636
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
Your Majesty's recovering very well.

637
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,280
Too bad.

638
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,320
The medicine will be finished soon.

639
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,720
I wonder when...

640
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,320
Your Majesty.

641
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,120
What if I

642
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,840
beg Duke Chu

643
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,520
to let the divine healer come
to check you again?

644
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,800
There's no need.

645
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,760
I can manage.

646
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,920
Huaizhi.

647
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
Yes.

648
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,200
You may go.

649
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,520
Yes.

650
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,040
You may go.

651
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,080
Do you have something to say?

652
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,760
I originally wanted to tell you.

653
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,120
But in looking at you,

654
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,960
it seems like you already know.

655
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,160
This medicine is fishy.

656
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,840
I know that.

657
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,240
A strong medicine

658
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,440
seems effective,

659
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,720
but it actually makes
one's health deteriorate.

660
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,280
But I

661
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
have no other choice.

662
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,240
Other people want to become the emperor

663
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,240
for the sake of power.

664
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,960
Qi Yan.

665
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
Why do you want

666
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,120
to become emperor?

667
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,560
To carry on the Qi clan's legacy.

668
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,960
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

669
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,840
Duke Chu sent an invitation.

670
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,640
Your Majesty, Your Highness.
Please get changed.

671
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,670
(Invitation)

672
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,970
(Selection of Chess Pieces
in Chess of Generals Camp)

673
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,960
(Invitation)
Duke Chu said

674
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,160
that he wanted to choose
new chess pieces.

675
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,120
How could the former
Chess Overseer not be there?

676
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,960
And Your Majesty

677
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,560
could also go out and get some air.

678
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,240
Please hurry.

679
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,520
Madam Jade.

680
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,280
This is bad. Something happened.

681
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,360
Madam Jade!

682
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,000
Your Majesty, you are here.

683
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,360
I don't feel well.

684
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,000
I won't bow to you then.

685
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,080
Serve the tea.

(Chess of Generals Camp)

687
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,120
This tea was made too badly.

688
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,280
Since Consort Shu is here,

689
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,800
please make tea

690
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,680
