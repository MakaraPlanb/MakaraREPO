Ziyuan.

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,360
Sir.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,720
We noticed a suspicious person
by the side yard.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
- Chase after him.
- Yes.

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,400
This is bad.

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,160
It's too late.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll delay them.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,800
Take care of Princess.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,360
Hurry.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:16,880
No.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,120
You two go.

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,440
I'll delay them.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
I'll also take revenge.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Do that another day.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,400
I can't lose this opportunity.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,120
With the Princess gone,

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,600
Qiu Ziliang surely won't let this go.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,240
If he investigates,

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
the citizens will suffer again.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,360
I should just

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
end this right here.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
But...

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm not doing this to help you.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
It's just that Wang Lin must die.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,440
Ziyuan.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Cheng Ruoyu.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Someday...

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,080
If that day really comes,

42
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,680
you must clear the names

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
of the thousands of heroes

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
in the Morning Dew Rebellion.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,280
Yu'er is gone.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
I've asked the guard already.

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,880
She left the palace in the afternoon

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
and hasn't returned yet.

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,880
Send people to find her.

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Yes.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,640
What do you want?

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm here to bring you out.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Bring us out?

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
You want to help me?

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Why?

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
You'll see when you go out.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
Come with me.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,840
Sir!

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,560
Sir.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,960
The west yard is on fire too.

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Put it out.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,640
This must be a diversion.

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Sir!

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,480
Sir.

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,280
Sir.

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,280
The fire is out.

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
But we didn't catch the assassin yet.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
Continue going after him!

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,720
Yes.

71
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Don't go inside.

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
But I hear something.

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,440
When Eunuch is inside,

74
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
no one is allowed to enter.

75
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,320
But Princess is inside,

76
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
Eunuch is so bold.

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
Follow this path,

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
and you can get out.

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
You haven't told me

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,080
why you're helping me yet.

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
You'll find out in the future.

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,080
Where are you going?

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,480
It's so late,

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,960
and you're not home yet.

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
Why are you here?

86
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,640
I came to thank you.

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
There's nothing to thank me for.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,320
In order to make Qiu Ziliang trust me,

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,920
I can only give him Liu Misha.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
But if I give her to Chess
of Generals Camp,

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,120
with Qiu Yanzhi there,

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
you won't be able to get her out.

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,640
But it's different if I give her
to Wang Lin.

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
Qiu Yanzhi, who has
unfathomable motives,

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
might be able to help you.

96
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,640
Now,

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,520
return Liu Misha to me.

98
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,240
I definitely won't give Princess Misha

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,000
to you.

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,680
No.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
You will,

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,960
or His Majesty

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
will die.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Chess Overseer.

105
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,400
Cheng Xi suddenly appeared

106
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,160
at the back of Wang Lin's Residence.

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,440
We don't dare to make a move
on our own.

108
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,680
Please provide instructions.

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Cheng Xi is at the back door?

110
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes.

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,320
She's blocking Cheng Ruoyu.

112
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,000
We fell for the trick.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,000
She intentionally kept Liu Misha

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
here with Wang Lin

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,320
in order to catch us

116
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,440
when someone comes to save her.

117
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,640
What should we do then?

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
Is the person we sent reliable?

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Yes.

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,880
Good.

121
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,400
Command everyone to leave.

122
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
We didn't come here tonight,

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,600
and we didn't do anything.

124
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,440
- All right.
- Yes.

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
If Qiu Ziliang finds out

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,840
that Qi Yan

127
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,240
sent you to save Liu Misha,

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,720
based on his personality,

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
he won't hold it in
until the appointment ceremony.

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,000
And at this time,

131
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,040
His Majesty

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
got seriously injured because of you.

133
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
Any soldier

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
can kill him.

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,200
His Majesty doesn't know

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,640
that I came to save Liu Misha at all.

137
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,840
I believe that,

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,320
but will Qiu Ziliang believe it?

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,640
So give me Princess,

140
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,280
and this matter will be over.

141
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll handle things on Wang Lin's side.

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,679
I'll also

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
treat Princess well.

144
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
And you can stay

145
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,880
at His Majesty's side,

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
let him recover quickly,

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
and continue fighting
against Qiu Ziliang.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
That's three birds with one stone.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,280
Wang Lin is dead?

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,880
Yes,

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,200
together with Princess Misha.

152
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
What exactly happened?

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,120
Official Wang drank too much last night.

154
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,440
Fire broke out in the residence.

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,200
He was worried that something
will happen to Princess,

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
so he went to check.

157
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,520
Then

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,360
he played around with Princess,

159
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,040
but things got out of hand,

160
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
and fire broke out again.

161
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Then they both died in the fire.

162
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
I especially instructed him

163
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,280
to watch Liu Misha well.

164
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
But he...

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
How can two fires break out

166
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,800
for no reason?

167
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
The first time was because

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,840
the chef in the residence
wasn't careful.

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
The fire was quickly extinguished.

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,240
The... The second time...

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,880
The second time... Well...

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,680
Official Wang likes to play...

173
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
play with candle wax.

174
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
And...

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Are you sure

176
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
that Wang Lin and Liu Misha
are the ones who died?

177
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
The guard saw Official Wang go inside.

178
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,040
Back then, Princess was fine.

179
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
I actually came today

180
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,040
to ask

181
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,920
who will replace Official Wang

182
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,560
now that he's dead.

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,560
Sir.

184
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,960
What do you think of Shi Yuan?

185
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,080
He's been working for you
for many years.

186
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,680
He may not be as capable
as Official Wang,

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,680
but...

188
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,680
But he's loyal.

189
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
Let's use Shi Yuan then.

190
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,200
Yes.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Jiang Ding really

192
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
told Qiu Ziliang that?

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,360
Yes.

194
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,120
Official Qiu already agreed

195
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,400
to let Shi Yuan take over
Wang Lin's job.

196
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,960
So

197
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Cheng Xi bought Jiang Ding off?

198
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
Cheng Xi's plan

199
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
hits three birds with one stone.

200
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
With Wang Lin dead,

201
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm afraid that his replacement,
Shi Yuan,

202
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,320
also works for Cheng Xi.

203
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,600
She hit three birds with one stone.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,040
She used us

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
and Cheng Ruoyu.

206
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
Your Majesty!

207
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,400
Your Majesty.

208
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Yu'er...

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
Yu'er is back.

210
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,640
What's the matter?

211
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Madam.

212
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
Zhenwu's reply arrived.

213
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,560
This is great.

214
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
They agreed to our condition.

215
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,000
Next,

216
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
we just have to wait
for the appointment ceremony

217
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,800
on the 16th next month.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But Master Thirteen

219
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
hasn't agreed yet.

220
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,840
Thirteen had been in seclusion
for too long.

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,120
He has become silly already.

222
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
He can't call the shots in this matter.

223
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
In the end,

224
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,200
if he really disagrees, forget it.

225
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,160
I'll do it myself.

226
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Madam, you...

227
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,680
What's the matter?

228
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Can't I become

229
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,760
the second female emperor?

230
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
You're adept in both the pen
and the sword.

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
You're far better than
the female emperor back then.

232
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
If that happens, it's fate.

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,880
Rise.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,600
I can't accept it.

235
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
I really can't accept it.

236
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
I was so close.

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,000
I could have

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,560
saved Princess Misha.

239
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
But Aunt...

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,600
It was Aunt.

241
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Since she wants

242
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,680
this position so much,

243
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,080
she can take it.

244
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Your Majesty.

245
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,520
But how long can she occupy

246
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,960
this position?

247
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,800
Who's there?

248
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,000
It's me.

249
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,720
It's me.

250
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Why are you here?

251
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,160
There's no time.

252
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,280
I'll make the long story short.

253
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,360
Are you willing

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,640
to fight Cheng Xi with me?

255
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,680
What I meant is

256
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,560
to totally ruin her reputation

257
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,760
and crush her,

258
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,560
so that she can no longer make
a comeback.

259
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,480
Can you

260
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,800
do that?

261
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,800
What happened?

262
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,800
Did she agree?

263
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,560
She's still hesitating.

264
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
I knew that Little Fish

265
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,720
couldn't do it.

266
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,840
After all,

267
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,720
Cheng Xi raised her.

268
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,320
Then we must find another way.

269
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,600
I must win against Cheng Xi.

270
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,920
I can't let her ruin

271
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,840
my plan for revenge.

272
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,640
(I want you to do two things.)

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,520
First.

274
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Find out Cheng Xi's identity

275
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
from Li Rong.

276
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
Now, we already know

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
that she's a descendant
of the Qi clan.

278
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,280
But who were her parents?

279
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,560
What was her name?

280
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,160
And how did she hide her identity

281
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
and entered the palace?

282
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,960
As her confidant,

283
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Li Rong must know something.

284
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Second.

285
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,160
After finding out,

286
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,480
expose Cheng Xi

287
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
in front of Qiu Ziliang.

288
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,280
Between Qi Yan and Cheng Xi,

289
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,680
you can only choose one person.

290
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,400
You can only choose one person.

291
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,880
Cheng Xi wants Qi Yan dead.

292
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,640
And if you

293
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,080
expose Cheng Xi

294
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,720
in front of Qiu Ziliang,

295
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,760
based on Qiu Ziliang's style,

296
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,480
Cheng Xi will surely die.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
(Why)

298
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,120
(must that person be me?)

299
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Only you

300
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,080
can make it believable.

301
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
(Yu'er.)

302
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,360
(There are some things)

303
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,760
(that I can't find out,)

304
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
(but you can.)

305
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Do you still remember

306
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,480
how you left

307
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,800
Wang Lin's Residence?

308
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
That woman beside Wang Lin

309
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,160
works for you?

310
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,040
Yu'er.

311
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,000
Now, only you

312
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
can save Qi Yan,

313
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,320
me,

314
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,680
and all of us.

315
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,560
(Save Qi Yan,)

316
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
(save me.)

317
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,599
(Save Qi Yan, save me.)

318
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,960
(Save me.)

319
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,920
(Save all of us.)

320
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,319
Who are you?

321
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,160
Don't come any closer.

322
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,960
Who's there?

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,840
Don't come near me.

324
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
It's so noisy.

325
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,280
It's the middle of the night. Who...

326
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,880
Yu'er.

327
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,160
Your Majesty.

328
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Don't come any closer.

329
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
What are you doing?

330
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,760
Yu'er.

331
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,360
Your Majesty.

332
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,600
My heart is like a sword.

333
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,520
suppressing the wicked
and eliminating evil.

334
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,480
My sword is like my heart,

335
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
protecting the nation
and being loyal to the emperor.

336
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,600
Yu'er.

337
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
Your Majesty.

338
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll surely save you.

339
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
I want to save you.

340
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Yu'er.

341
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,560
I'll save you.

342
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
All right.

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
I'll wait for you to save me.

344
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,120
Do you know

345
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,520
about her headaches?

346
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,680
Your Majesty.

347
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,440
I knew

348
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
about this matter before.

349
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,680
But this is the first time that I saw

350
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,200
how serious it is.

351
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,440
How was she injured?

352
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,520
Huaizhi.

353
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
I found my niece.

354
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,080
This is my niece,

355
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,160
Yu'er.

356
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,880
Where did you find her?

357
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,000
There was famine back home.

358
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,280
My elder brother and his wife
left home with her,

359
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,360
but human traffickers

360
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,920
took her along the way.

361
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
She was seriously sick.

362
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
The human traffickers thought
that she wouldn't recover anymore,

363
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,600
so they threw her away.

364
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
Good thing Yu'er was lucky.

365
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,840
His Highness Prince Guang saved her.

366
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,400
A while ago,

367
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,560
didn't I ask for medicine
from His Highness?

368
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,160
I recognized her immediately.

369
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,400
By the way, Huaizhi,

370
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,720
can we change her surname
to Cheng as well?

371
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,400
As you know,

372
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
I have an enemy before,

373
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
and I was forced to be on the run.

374
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
I can't return home either.

375
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,800
All right.

376
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,800
It's good for her to have
the surname of Cheng.

377
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,520
This child

378
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,080
is very lucky

379
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
to have met you.

380
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,200
Yu'er.

381
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,680
Yu'er.

382
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,720
Child.

383
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,840
Child.

384
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
Her head is injured.

385
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,160
She also doesn't remember
anything in the past.

386
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,080
And she often has nightmares.

387
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,160
His Highness Prince Guang said

388
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,400
that she must continue

389
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,640
receiving treatment for some time.

390
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,040
Yu'er.

391
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,640
Don't worry.

392
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,520
From now on,

393
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,160
not only will your aunt
take care of you,

394
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
I will take good care of you too.

395
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,360
That was what Cheng Xi...

396
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,520
Now, I should call her Qi Xi now.

397
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
I had no doubts about that story.

398
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,160
All these years,

399
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,800
I didn't really talk about the past.

400
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,480
I was afraid that she'd be sad.

401
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,880
On hindsight,

402
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,440
a lot of aspects

403
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
don't fit.

404
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
It means

405
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,840
that from the very start,

406
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,240
it was only Cheng Xi

407
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,840
who claimed that Yu'er is her niece.

408
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,120
Am I right?

409
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes.

410
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,240
Summon Uncle.

411
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,920
Yes.

412
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
Uncle, what do you think?

413
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,560
When Cheng Xi went to me that day,

414
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
she saw Yu'er

415
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,520
and said that she's her niece.

416
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,480
I asked how she was sure about it.

417
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,000
She said that aside from her looks,

418
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,040
she recognized

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,480
a birth mark on her.

420
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,120
How did she know about that?

421
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Come to think of it,

422
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,760
she probably saw it beforehand.

423
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
That was why she said that.

424
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
I didn't doubt her,

425
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
and I hastily

426
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
gave Yu'er to her.

427
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,640
Your Majesty, forgive me.

428
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,920
Why are you saying that?

429
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,040
Cheng Xi has been hiding her identity
for so many years.

430
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,360
She even fooled me and Huaizhi,

431
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
let alone you.

432
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,480
No medicine can cure

433
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,800
Yu'er's illness.

434
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,800
And I don't know when she'll have

435
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,840
another attack.

436
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,200
As of now,

437
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,560
we can only let her calm down

438
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,440
and not receive

439
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,760
any external stimulation.

440
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,160
Otherwise...

441
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,360
(I was wrong back then.)

442
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,000
Your Majesty.

443
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,480
What's the situation

444
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,200
in Zhenwu and Lucong?

445
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
In Zhenwu,

446
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,360
since Princess Misha hasn't been back
for so long,

447
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,760
they're starting to be impatient.

448
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,120
In Lucong,

449
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,160
like Chen Yintai,

450
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,200
Zhang Jiang is requesting
a tally and ceremonial axe

451
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,880
but because of the lesson learned
from the previous example,

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
he doesn't dare to do anything.

453
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,120
All right.

454
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
I need you to do

455
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,240
another thing.

456
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,480
Your Majesty, please tell me.

457
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,600
Investigate

458
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,080
Yu'er's real identity

459
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,720
as well

460
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,800
as the interactions

461
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
between Uncle and Cheng Xi
all these years.

462
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Your Majesty.

463
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,520
Do you really think

464
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,880
that she...

465
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,840
It's not that I don't trust her.

466
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,920
If Yu'er isn't Cheng Ruoyu,

467
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
but someone Cheng Xi

468
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,480
intentionally placed on my side,

469
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
then there must be a special reason.

470
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,200
I

471
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
asked Uncle to take her away before.

472
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,720
Yet he encountered

473
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
obstacles repeatedly.

474
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I never believe

475
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,800
in coincidences.

476
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,320
There must be a reason.

477
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,280
Yes.

478
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,880
Go.

479
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Who are you?

480
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,840
Official Jiang.

481
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,680
Do you like this gift?

482
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,280
My... My son.

483
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,320
Jiang Ding's wife is very fierce.

484
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,680
She never had a child
after many years.

485
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,840
He has an illegitimate son

486
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
that he's been hiding from his family.

487
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,400
I captured his son,

488
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
and he confessed indeed.

489
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,240
What did Cheng Xi promise him?

490
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,040
The position
of Shencai Army General-in-Chief.

491
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,240
Between power and family,

492
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,760
family is more important indeed.

493
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,800
And I promised him

494
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,840
that after we succeed,

495
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
the General-in-Chief position
will still be his.

496
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,880
Watch him well

497
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,200
to avoid him from going back
on his decision.

498
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,240
Don't worry.

499
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,080
Is it

500
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,840
Shi Yuan's turn next?

501
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
Have you checked his background?

502
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
He only has one weakness.

503
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,640
He loves drinking.

504
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,640
That is a very good weakness.

505
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,520
Why am I here?

506
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
Where is His Majesty?

507
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,880
Why are you still here?

508
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,600
I heard already.

509
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
You're not the real niece

510
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,080
of Cheng Xi.

511
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
Now that Cheng Xi's conspiracy

512
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,480
has been exposed,

513
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,160
out of kindness,

514
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,320
His Majesty couldn't bear to kill you.

515
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
But how can you

516
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,120
stay here so shamelessly?

517
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I'm only staying here

518
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,760
to protect His Majesty.

519
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,640
Who is protecting whom?

520
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,800
Forget about

521
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,120
all the troubles that you caused

522
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,040
His Majesty before.

523
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,360
Just this time,

524
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,480
you suddenly went crazy

525
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,880
and almost killed him.

526
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,640
If you really want to help His Majesty,

527
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,960
you should go to Cheng Xi

528
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,040
and kill her,

529
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,440
then kill Qiu Ziliang,

530
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,200
and completely eliminate
His Majesty's troubles.

531
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,080
You shouldn't stay here

532
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
and drag him down

533
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
in the name of protecting him.

534
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,480
Do you want to tell me

535
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,520
that you can't kill Qiu Ziliang

536
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,400
and you can't bear to kill Cheng Xi?

537
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
You're useless.

538
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,040
That's enough.

539
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,280
Your Majesty.

540
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,600
Your Majesty.

541
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,520
From now on, without my permission,

542
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,000
don't enter my bed chambers.

543
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,040
But she can lie down

544
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
on your bed?

545
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,680
She's my Sword Bearer,

546
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
and she's seriously ill.

547
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,120
Sword Bearer?

548
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,720
Your Majesty, why are you fooling
yourself and others?

549
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,840
Don't mind her.

550
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,160
Did I really

551
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
almost kill you?

552
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,040
No.

553
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,840
You

554
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
saw me

555
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,760
and immediately stopped.

556
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,320
So

557
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,600
how can you harm me?

558
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
What's the matter? Do you feel guilty?

559
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm really fine.

560
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,600
Am I not well?

561
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,600
His Highness Prince Guang
visited you yesterday.

562
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,360
He said that you can only rest

563
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,920
to recover.

564
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
I know.

565
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,200
You're sad about your aunt.

566
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm the same.

567
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,240
No matter how hard life is,

568
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,760
it must go on, right?

569
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,200
Uncle.

570
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,520
I've had headaches before,

571
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,520
but I've never had hallucinations.

572
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
But this time,

573
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,600
I saw many people wanting to kill me.

574
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,320
All of them

575
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,000
were wearing Shencai Army attire

576
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
and looked very fierce.

577
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,400
I wanted to retaliate, so I...

578
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,320
Yu'er.

579
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,840
His Highness Prince Guang
also mentioned yesterday

580
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,080
that from now on,

581
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,240
as long as you don't receive
any external stimulation,

582
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,360
this

583
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
won't happen again.

584
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,560
Uncle.

585
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,440
Perhaps

586
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
I really should leave this place.

587
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,600
To His Majesty,

588
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
I am

589
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
a latent danger

590
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,760
and also a burden.

591
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,720
Silly girl.

592
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,440
You keep saying silly things.

593
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,000
Where can you go if you leave?

594
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,560
I sent someone to watch Cheng Xi
and Li Rong.

595
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,320
They've only been staying
in Official Qiu's residence.

596
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,160
They didn't go out.

597
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,240
In that case,

598
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,720
there's only one possibility.

599
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,840
Liu Misha is in Qiu Ziliang's residence.

600
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,480
Then I'll go and check again.

601
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,440
There's no need.

602
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,000
She wasn't there last time.

603
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,520
That was why Cheng Xi
allowed you to check.

604
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,880
Now,

605
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,400
if she's really
in Qiu Ziliang's residence,

606
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,520
they must have prepared a trap

607
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,880
for you.

608
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,720
What should we do then?

609
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
At this point,

610
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,480
Little Fish

611
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,480
is still hesitating.

612
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,520
She's so indecisive.

613
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
She's very sentimental and loyal.

614
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,040
It's a pro and also a con.

615
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,680
Let's set aside Liu Misha first.

616
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
How are things on Yuan Xing's side?

617
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,360
I bought off

618
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,320
some of his concubines and staff

619
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,280
to tell him things

620
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,080
and stimulate his dissatisfaction
towards Shi Yuan.

621
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,360
It's taking effect now.

622
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,840
They just haven't told him
enough things yet.

623
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,239
We must make him

624
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,480
want to kill him.

625
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,639
You're here.

626
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,920
I want the map
of Qiu Ziliang's residence,

627
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,400
Aunt's location,

628
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,679
and also

629
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,320
your help.

630
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,560
Qiu Ziliang thinks

631
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,840
that he's the best in martial arts.

632
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,120
That's why security isn't tight
in his residence.

633
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Based on your martial arts skill,

634
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,440
you should be able to sneak in.

635
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
But Cheng Xi

636
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,160
would arrange warriors of sacrifice
to make patrols.

637
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,560
You have to see

638
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
how you can avoid them.

639
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,000
Madam Li.

640
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,880
Yu'er?

641
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,240
Why are you here?

642
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,560
Go.

643
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,200
I want to ask you something.

644
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,880
I won't tell you anything.

645
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,720
Listen.

646
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
While no one knows that you're here yet,

647
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,000
leave.

648
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
If Madam finds out,

649
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
it will be bad.

650
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,040
Go.

651
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,920
Tell me

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,680
where Misha is.

653
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,360
I can't.

654
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Tell me.

655
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Yu'er.

656
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,000
I've been with Madam for ten years.

657
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
Aside from respecting her,

658
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,520
we're friends.

659
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,840
I won't betray her.

660
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,880
Where are you going?

661
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,280
Aunt and I

662
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,920
must have closure.

663
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,400
Now isn't the time.

664
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,880
Yu'er.

665
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,800
Listen to me.

666
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,760
Your aunt has her reasons.

667
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
Forget it if you won't help her.

668
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,760
But you must definitely

669
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
not fight with her.

670
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,200
Understand?

671
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,440
Then tell me

672
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,200
what her reason is.

673
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,360
You really want to know?

674
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,360
Why don't you ask me directly?

675
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,440
Because I know

676
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
that you won't tell me.

677
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,960
That's right.

678
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,640
Before we succeed,

679
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,360
I won't tell you anything,

680
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,480
so that you won't ruin my plans.

681
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,120
Even if you don't tell me,

682
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,520
I'll continue bothering you,

683
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,080
and I'll still ruin your plans.

684
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,280
I warned you before.

685
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,480
If you want Qi Yan to live,

686
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,120
don't do anything stupid.

687
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,920
Even if I do that,

688
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,920
His Majesty will still die.

689
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,240
Not necessarily.

690
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,200
Perhaps, for the sake

691
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,040
of being part of the same clan,

692
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
I won't totally finish him off.

693
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,960
How is that different
from killing him?

694
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,200
That's Qi Yan's destiny.

695
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,040
Yu'er.

696
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
You still want to fight?

697
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,720
Aunt.

698
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,840
You and I must have closure
sooner and later.

699
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,720
Today,

700
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,560
I came to end this matter.

701
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,840
Today,

702
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,160
His Majesty won't be able

703
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,240
to block the sword for you.

704
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
It's not your fault.

705
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,440
If you were just a maid servant,

706
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,200
you wouldn't experience these things.

707
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,160
It's because

708
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,720
you're my weakness.

709
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,560
Do you think

710
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,120
that your martial arts skill
improved a lot?

711
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,960
Compared to me,

712
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,080
you're so far off.

713
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,160
Stop fighting!

714
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
Stop fighting, Madam.

715
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,800
Yu'er is immature.

716
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
Let's just talk to her.

717
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,240
Scram!

718
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,440
Yu'er.

719
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,000
You can't treat your aunt this way.

720
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,200
Put down the sword!

721
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,280
Madam Li, stay out of this.

722
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,880
Move!

723
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,520
You...

724
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:20,880
Madam!

725
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,040
(You keep saying that you want
to protect me,)

726
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,280
(yet you don't know)

727
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,000
(that you're the one)

728
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,280
(I want to protect the most.)

729
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,480
(I don't care who you are)

730
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,480
(and what kind of motive)

731
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,640
(Cheng Xi has for you,)

732
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,320
(as long as you're away from me,)

733
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,600
(you'll be safe.)

734
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,080
Cheng Ruoyu.

735
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,560
Wake up.

736
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I have something

737
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,440
that I must tell you right away.

738
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,680
Thirteen is right.

739
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Your martial arts talent

740
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,640
is above mine indeed.

741
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,240
I originally thought
that when you grew up,

742
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,000
you'd be able to help me

743
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
after being great in martial arts.

744
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
In the end...

745
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,080
Madam.

746
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,960
Madam, bad news!

747
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,320
Your Pill Making Room is on fire!

748
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,720
You're just a diversion.

749
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,520
You brought accomplices?

750
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
Princess Misha

751
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,200
is hiding in your Pill Making Room,

752
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,760
isn't she?

753
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
Watch her well!

754
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,880
It's just as you expected.

755
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,640
We did it.

756
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,400
We'll only be successful
after taking her to Qi Yan.

757
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,000
Let's go.

758
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,640
Yes.

759
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,240
Nice, Cheng Ruoyu.

760
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,840
I taught you martial arts,

761
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,200
and you're going against me.

762
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,440
If I had known,
I should have let you die

763
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,760
from that arrow to your heart back then.

764
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,760
Madam, don't be angry.

765
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,560
Yu'er...

766
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,280
Yu'er is just...

767
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,960
Let go!

768
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,960
It's so lively here.

769
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,480
She's inside?

770
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,240
Yes.

771
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,920
Don't worry.

772
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,200
Official Qiu had heard

773
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,840
the fight

774
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,760
on Cheng Xi's side now

775
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
and went to check.

776
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Qiu Ziliang wants to know

777
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,160
what's going on,

778
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,920
and Cheng Xi can't speak the truth,

779
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,440
so she can only swallow her grievance.

780
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,360
But I'm afraid that Little Fish
won't be so lucky

781
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,560
in Official Qiu's hands.

782
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,840
That's why we must hurry.

783
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,680
It's up to Qi Yan next.

784
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,960
Tell me.

785
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
Why are you and your niece

786
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,800
fighting in the middle of the night?

787
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,520
Tell me,

788
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,360
so that I can do you justice.

789
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,000
Cheng Xi.

790
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,520
You go first.

791
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,960
I stabbed His Majesty.

792
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,520
That was why Yu'er was fighting with me.

793
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm sorry to bother you with this.

794
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,320
Is that so?

795
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes.

796
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,160
It's not a big deal.

797
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,360
But I heard

798
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,920
that you want to kill her.

799
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,720
I was just angry.

800
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,440
I didn't teach my niece well.

801
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,560
I regret it so much.

802
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,480
I'll teach her a lesson

803
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,880
on your behalf then.

804
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,640
I guarantee that she'll become

805
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,480
an obedient,

806
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,840
nice,

807
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,680
and sensible niece.
