1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,430
(What's Thicker Than Blood?)

2
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,000
(Episode 11)

3
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,640
Well,

4
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,079
when will your friend, Won Tak,
come back to Seoul?

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,679
I think it will take
two or three more days,

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
seeing how Si Hyung doesn't know
anyone down there.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,320
Oh, no.

8
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:41,359
I can clear this.
I'll put it in the recycle bin over there.

9
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:45,529
Then...

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,200
do you want to sleep over...

11
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:51,400
at my place tonight?

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
What?

13
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:57,870
No. I don't have any ulterior motive.

14
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,439
Just like the other night,

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,378
I will sleep in the living room
where the TV is.

16
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,749
And you can sleep in my bed.

17
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:08,220
I just want to be with you.

18
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:12,218
I'm serious. I won't try anything.

19
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,119
I won't even touch you.
So you don't have to worry about it.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,290
Why must I sleep over at your place
if you're not going to try anything?

21
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:23,169
- What?
- Why won't you even touch me?

22
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,829
What?

23
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,600
You must be quite conservative
in that area.

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,939
What? I didn't mean it like that.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,608
It's okay. We don't have to rush.

26
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,950
Just let me know
when you are ready and comfortable.

27
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,680
I can wait.

28
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,620
Who said I wasn't ready?

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,259
I'm totally ready.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,719
Both physically and mentally.

31
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,169
I'm totally comfortable with it.

32
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:56,469
So we don't have to wait.

33
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,070
Hold on!

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,280
I need more time.

35
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,790
Chak Hee.

36
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,749
What happened to your face?
Did something happen?

37
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,298
You live in a terrible neighborhood.

38
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,229
The cab driver
couldn't find his way.

39
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,230
What?

40
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,609
What is she doing here?

41
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,540
Are you two living together?

42
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,440
Don't be absurd.

43
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,750
She's temporarily staying upstairs
due to personal matters.

44
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,118
Which is?

45
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,720
That's none of your business.

46
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,149
What happened to you?
Did someone beat you up?

47
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,489
Can I stay here for a few days?

48
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,530
Where do you think you're going?

49
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,139
Gosh.

50
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,970
Do you have ramyeon? I'm famished.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,510
Unbelievable.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,309
You barge in here
in the middle of the night,

53
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,750
and now, you want ramyeon?

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,118
What happened to you?

55
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,119
Who did that?

56
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,780
Tell me.

57
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,009
I got in a fight with some chick
at the grocery store.

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,958
I grabbed the last grapefruit,

59
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,789
but she claimed that it was hers.

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,829
How ridiculous.

61
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,200
What?

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,259
Don't worry. I won.

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,429
I gave her a bloody nose.

64
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,999
You went grocery shopping
in that outfit?

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,239
Then did you expect me
to wear something formal?

66
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,440
Where's the grapefruit?

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,810
Well...

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,419
I gave it to her in exchange
for giving her a bloody nose.

69
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,579
I yielded.

70
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:31,950
What is all this?

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,159
Is today a special day?

72
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,099
No.

73
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,200
What?

74
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,670
Come on. What special day?

75
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,670
For me?

76
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,839
For us? I mean...

77
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,479
I mean... For me.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,479
I don't know!
I wasn't going to do anything!

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,689
Why are you here?

80
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,990
This is his house.

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,760
I was just worried.

82
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,759
About whom? Me or him?

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,789
Of course, him...

84
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,029
It's you, of course.

85
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,898
It's getting late.
Don't you think your parents will worry?

86
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,439
You should give them a call.

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,139
- Right.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

88
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:26,380
I'm going to stay here for a few days
until my wound heals.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,909
After all,
I don't want my parents to worry.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,879
I'm not sure if you should stay
at a young man's house.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,120
Your parents will be worried sick
if they find out.

92
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,620
That's none of your business.

93
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,859
I don't know
what's going on with you,

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,898
but how about you come with me
to the rooftop?

95
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,000
We're both girls.
I think that'll be better.

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,638
No, thanks.
I'm going to stay with him.

97
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,940
That's why I came here.

98
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,680
Chak Hee, get out.

99
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,620
I've put up with you enough.
Get out!

100
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,518
What? Why do I need
to sleep upstairs...

101
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,389
when this is my house?

102
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,729
Gosh. But I was so ready.

103
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,829
- Ready for what?
- My gosh.

104
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:27,070
I don't want to see your face
when I lie down.

105
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,969
So you should sleep
in the living room,

106
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,139
and I'll sleep...

107
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,339
over there.

108
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,909
Do you want to die?

109
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,689
Look. As you can see,

110
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,219
I was spoiled, growing up.

111
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:51,930
I can't sleep on this hard floor.
Okay?

112
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,560
Darn it!

113
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,969
Do you really want to die?

114
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,870
Oh, come on!

115
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,589
Sleep here?

116
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,320
What is this?

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
I smell his scent.

118
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,700
Isn't it rude to do that
on someone else's bed?

119
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,599
What's it to you?
He's not even yours.

120
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:45,908
What are you doing?

121
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,478
Didn't you just say
that it was rude to do that?

122
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,190
I have a herniated disc.

123
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,050
Gosh, she's so annoying.

124
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:57,889
Gosh.

125
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,459
For the past two days,

126
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,599
I got up on the wrong side
of the bed.

127
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,440
It was worse for me.

128
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,740
I want to grab
a stranger by the collar...

129
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,579
and get in a fight right now.

130
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,639
I want to do worse.

131
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,209
So be quiet and go to bed.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,810
I don't even want
to hear you breathing.

133
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,950
If I hear you snoring, I'll...

134
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,898
What? What will you do?

135
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,130
How can anyone sleep that quietly?

136
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:46,780
Gosh.

137
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:09,700
Do you want to die?

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Fine.

139
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,609
Goodnight.

140
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,839
This is all because of Jin Moo Hak.

141
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,930
If it wasn't your brother,
then who could it have been?

142
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:57,009
How in the world
did that wench find out?

143
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,849
I heard he was the one
who helped out...

144
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,450
with the exhibition
and the supplies.

145
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,589
Maybe they fell for each other.

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,359
In any case,

147
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,790
I won't let this slide.

148
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,129
I put in so much effort
and spent a hefty sum on this.

149
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,070
How dare he ruin my plan?

150
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:25,469
What's it to you
what happens to him?

151
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,579
You guys aren't even related!

152
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,650
What was that about?

153
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:38,520
What about Moo Hak?
What will you do to him?

154
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,560
You idiot.

155
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,060
How could you call yourself
my daughter?

156
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,530
I introduced you to Jang Tae Jin,

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,239
but you couldn't even seduce him.

158
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,469
You fell for that idiot,
so I let you be.

159
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,609
But you also failed to seduce him,
and look what you've done.

160
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,848
I enrolled you
in a prestigious school,

161
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:06,849
gave you a good job,
and helped your sales.

162
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,290
In exchange
for helping you become...

163
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,489
a decent human being,

164
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,119
you should've at least
found yourself a good man!

165
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,129
None of that was for me.

166
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,300
What?

167
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,829
You were just using me.

168
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,939
It wasn't about me.
You wanted to satisfy your clients.

169
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,499
It was all out of greed!

170
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,270
How dare you?

171
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,640
What kind of guy would like me?

172
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,979
Even my own dad mistreats me,

173
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,119
so who in the world would love me?

174
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,349
How dare you?

175
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,420
Darn it!

176
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,680
Are you really not going to work?

177
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,919
Then at least call them
that you are sick or something.

178
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,950
You can't just skip work
without any notice.

179
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:50,619
They will be worried about you.

180
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,349
It's fine. My dad got me that job.
No one will care.

181
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,660
She has it easy, doesn't she?

182
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,930
Stop it.

183
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,959
Then get up. I'll drop you off.

184
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,499
No.

185
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:04,900
Chak Hee.

186
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,239
I'm not going back now.

187
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,508
I told you I wanted to stay here
for a few days.

188
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,989
Can't you at least let me do that
after what you did to my dad?

189
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,389
(Fifty dollars)

190
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,759
Did you get that bruise
because of what I did?

191
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,690
Did your father hit you?

192
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,300
- Chak Hee.
- Moo Hak.

193
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,839
I know that my dad is awful,

194
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,039
a corrupt politician,
and a hypocrite.

195
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,140
That's all true about him.

196
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,310
I don't deny that.

197
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,950
But he is still my father.

198
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,259
Did you think about me even once?

199
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,859
Were you reminded of me
even for a moment?

200
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,509
That's how insignificant
I am to you.

201
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,879
I feel so pathetic.

202
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,250
Blood is thicker than water indeed.
She's An Sang Tae's daughter?

203
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,440
Anyway, I doubt he will
just sit back and take the hit.

204
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:50,739
I'm talking about An Sang Tae.

205
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,569
I knew what I was getting into.

206
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,209
I at least bought some time.

207
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,508
Oh, right. What happened
to Si Hyung? He disappeared?

208
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:58,810
He just disappeared.

209
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,020
He somehow knew
we were coming and vanished.

210
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,519
He left behind all of his belongings
at the lodging.

211
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:06,219
He is okay, right?

212
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,440
- Hey. Wake up.
- Hey.

213
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

214
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,379
- Come on.
- Hey.

215
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,180
- What?
- Gosh.

216
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,348
- Hey.
- Hey.

217
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:37,349
Hey. It's too early for this.

218
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:41,089
Hey. Let go of me. What is this?

219
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,489
I'm Kim Si Hyung, the oldest son
of the Cheongsong family!

220
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,030
What?

221
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,469
Who is this?

222
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,300
This is An Sang Tae.

223
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,369
I see.

224
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,410
You came here to get me out of here.

225
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,050
"A hard worker for my district,
always jolly around the year!"

226
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,979
"Vote for me, An Sang Tae!"

227
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,520
You are not in your right mind.

228
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,660
- What?
- Kim Si Hyung. You.

229
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,890
Did you know your stuff turned up?

230
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:21,399
It turned up? Where? Who found it?

231
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,930
The police are out there,
trying to catch you.

232
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,070
They are looking for you
with their eyes peeled.

233
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:29,499
Of course,

234
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,609
I don't plan on
handing you over to them.

235
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,910
Hey. Do you want to disappear
from the face of the earth...

236
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,619
quietly?

237
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,249
Or...

238
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,060
will you do what I tell you to do?

239
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,499
Expect a call by 2 p.m.

240
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,069
Get him to wash up
and be on standby.

241
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,170
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,319
What do you think?

243
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,989
With this, we can get
the public on our side.

244
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:24,029
And we'll be able to get the gallery
to shut down quickly.

245
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:28,229
There is a top priority
throughout all this.

246
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,029
It's that Da Li cannot get hurt from this.

247
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,440
Find another way.

248
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:43,110
You can see what's in front of you,
but not the whole picture.

249
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,910
To deepen a relationship
between lovers,

250
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,450
they need obstacles and hardships.

251
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,489
Use this opportunity...

252
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,390
to show her clearly...

253
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,019
how scary this world is.

254
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:59,459
And show her that the person...

255
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,100
who can protect her
in this scary world...

256
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,900
is you, Jang Tae Jin.

257
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,700
Only you.

258
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,299
Only then,

259
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,340
she will not take you for granted.

260
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,450
That arrogant wench.

261
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,920
How dare she come after me?

262
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,559
(Jokbal Night Market)

263
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,568
People's desperate wishes such as
longevity, wealth, and honor...

264
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,370
are often the subjects
of our folk paintings.

265
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,279
So depending on the subjects,
the interpretation can differ.

266
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,709
Peonies represent wealth and honor.

267
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,680
Pomegranates represent fertility
in families.

268
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,950
Then what about ducks?

269
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,959
They represent good marriages.

270
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,360
Marriages?

271
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,660
Marriages...

272
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,199
Birds in our folk art...

273
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,969
mostly represent peace
and happiness of marriages.

274
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,240
They always include a pair
of male and female birds.

275
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,739
Then...

276
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,279
does she want me to die as a bachelor?

277
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,450
All good now. Right?

278
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,069
Moo Hak is inside, right?

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
- Sir.
- Let go of me!

280
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,370
Sir.

281
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,209
Hey.

282
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,180
How could you do this to me?

283
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,509
How?

284
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,950
I... Darn it.

285
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,150
I begged you.

286
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,850
How could you stab me
in the back, you jerk?

287
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,559
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

288
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,390
You handed over the files.

289
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,430
You don't think I know that?

290
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,299
You got your secretary...

291
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,299
to check the land registers!

292
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:24,508
Is this because you lost your chance
at this green belt deal?

293
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,169
How dare you keep
playing dumb with me?

294
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,080
I should be furious with you!

295
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:32,850
Sir.

296
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,390
I told her to get me
the land registers.

297
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:39,650
So what?

298
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,189
We invested a boatload of money
into that.

299
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,319
Don't I get to look into
how things are going?

300
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,289
I handed over the files to Kim Da Li?
Who said that?

301
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,100
Why must I do that for her?

302
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,529
Don't forget who I am.

303
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
I only care about making money!

304
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,308
You are the one who drove this deal
to the drain along with our land...

305
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,468
and the construction company.

306
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:00,238
How dare you put that on me?

307
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,580
- You're not going to drop the act?
- It really wasn't you?

308
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,279
- No.
- He's lying.

309
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,850
He's the only one
who could have leaked it.

310
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,589
Assemblyman An looked into it.
But he was the only one...

311
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,989
Jang Tae Jin knew it too.

312
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,988
You two bought land behind my back.

313
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,600
And you bought
a construction company.

314
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,430
I heard everything from Jang Tae Jin.

315
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,799
Are you sure the green belt deal
was confidential?

316
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,968
Otherwise, how would
Jang Tae Jin know that?

317
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:28,999
Dad.

318
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,610
You cannot believe what he says.

319
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,440
I'm serious.

320
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:38,379
He came to our restaurant
and grabbed me by my collar.

321
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,850
What more do you need to believe me?

322
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,249
He told me to quit dreaming...

323
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,719
about that woman and the gallery.

324
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
You still think I did it?

325
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,160
And not him?

326
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,319
What's going on?

327
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,489
Dad, he's not telling the truth!

328
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,299
Jang Tae Jin
couldn't have done that.

329
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:59,670
Who's ordering An Sang Tae around?

330
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,170
- What?
- Who's the mastermind behind this?

331
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,640
You have to know that
to determine how to handle this.

332
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:10,809
That...

333
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,278
- You sure it wasn't you?
- It wasn't!

334
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,259
If it turns out to be you,
I will kick you out with nothing.

335
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,360
You will be saying goodbye
to Dondon forever.

336
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,729
Can you promise me that?

337
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,900
Do whatever you want.

338
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,650
Jin Ki Chul.

339
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,350
Yes, Father.

340
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,630
Do you really...

341
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,330
have a card in your hand?

342
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,330
Yes, of course.

343
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,140
An Sang Tae said he could
handle this soon.

344
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,110
The green belt isn't over.

345
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,049
If something goes wrong again,

346
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,719
I'll be saying goodbye to not just Dondon
but also you.

347
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,489
You'll go back to being Oh Ki Chul.

348
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,019
Understood?

349
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,160
Yes.

350
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,630
Darn it.

351
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,940
Darn it.

352
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,979
Jang Tae Jin, that jerk...

353
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,150
What the heck is he thinking?

354
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,649
How are you going to deal
with this later?

355
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,789
You should've just told the truth.

356
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,190
Find out who An Sang Tae
has been meeting with.

357
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,258
- What?
- And just in case,

358
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,299
find out whether
there is some sort of connection...

359
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
between Jang Tae Jin
and An Sang Tae.

360
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,069
Between Jang Tae Jin
and An Sang Tae?

361
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,360
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

362
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,505
The petition bulletin board
on the Blue House website...

363
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,160
That must have been Ms. Kim, right?

364
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,700
How can she reject
such a golden opportunity?

365
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,020
The land itself must cost
tens of millions of dollars.

366
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,008
Then do you want an apartment
to take place of our gallery?

367
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,509
You can always build the gallery
somewhere else.

368
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,140
Somewhere else.

369
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:44,979
Where?

370
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,500
Where do you think would be good?

371
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:51,590
Somewhere you can go
only on holidays or weekends?

372
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,988
Somewhere with
a famous restaurant nearby...

373
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:56,930
so that you can drop by
on your way to the restaurant?

374
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,028
Somewhere the subway doesn't run...

375
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:01,900
so that there are more
squirrels and birds than visitors?

376
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:06,399
I'm just saying,
from Ms. Kim's perspective,

377
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,340
that option could have been better.

378
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,669
Frankly, with that money,

379
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,509
an entire generation
wouldn't have to work.

380
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,850
Can you understand that decision?
I honestly can't.

381
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,719
That's why they say
blood is thicker than water.

382
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,019
Like father, like daughter.

383
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,920
She is just like the late Director.

384
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,090
You know...

385
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,360
she might be holding out.

386
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:33,399
Land doesn't rot.

387
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,798
The longer you hold out,
the more expensive the land gets.

388
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,870
What?

389
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:40,670
If not that,
maybe she'll marry Jang Tae Jin...

390
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,809
and build a Segi Tower?

391
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:49,409
I think Ms. Kim likes Mr. Jin
more than Jang Tae Jin.

392
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,450
Jin Sang?

393
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,019
- That Jin Sang?
- Mr. Jin.

394
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,360
Listen. During the event
with the Three Frogs Restaurant,

395
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,930
didn't you see some sort of spark
between those two?

396
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,239
You could see it in their eyes.

397
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:13,969
Their eyes...

398
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,478
How dare you?

399
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,850
Ms. Kim would suit
literally anyone else better.

400
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:26,719
Sometimes you're so funny.

401
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,450
Come on.

402
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,489
I swear they go well together.

403
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:33,458
In what way?

404
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,058
They go well together.

405
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,090
Stop.

406
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,930
Is that so?

407
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,630
Do you think I go well with Mr. Jin?

408
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,930
Well...

409
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,369
These are some ideas about
some profit-generating projects.

410
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,039
And this is my feedback on
the exhibition plan.

411
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,479
I changed the overall direction.
Please take a look.

412
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,450
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Hwang was just being funny.

413
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,850
You're not upset, are you?

414
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,548
Why would I be?

415
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:03,349
To hear that I go well
with someone so decent?

416
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,950
I think she's upset.

417
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,459
Mr. Jin is knowledgeable,
handsome, gentle.

418
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,330
He's also popular among women.

419
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,999
I'm a lot inferior, compared to him.

420
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,229
Ms. Kim.

421
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,469
Being too humble is the worst.

422
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,909
If Mr. Jin were to hear that,

423
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,910
he would call you Jin Sang.

424
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,279
- It was right there.
- Don't.

425
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,799
I can upload the recruitment ad
for the new intern today, right?

426
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,549
Of course. Please, do.

427
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,259
(Lawyer Cha)

428
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,259
Lawyer Cha.

429
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,229
(Notice of permission
to pay inheritance tax)

430
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:56,340
(Amount of tax to be paid:
285,673 dollars)

431
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,379
I proofread everything,

432
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,680
but you should read it again.

433
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,469
It's more money
than you imagined, isn't it?

434
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes.

435
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,519
You have a way of getting it?

436
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,519
I'll find one.

437
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,459
Why did you mess with
the green belt case?

438
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:18,190
That was rash.

439
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,370
This will make it even harder
to get a loan from the bank.

440
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,639
If you don't do anything,

441
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,140
it might be auctioned off.

442
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,439
- Excuse me?
- I'll look for all other options,

443
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,208
but you should also go see
the adults in your family...

444
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:35,410
and ask for help whatever it takes.

445
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,650
It's better than asking strangers.

446
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,839
(International arrivals)

447
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,450
(Thank you for being born.)

448
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,249
Write your celebrity fashion article
next time and follow me.

449
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,420
Are you Kim Hong Chun?

450
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,718
I heard your relationship
with your brother went sour enough...

451
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,258
for you not to attend his funeral.

452
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,360
What are you doing here?

453
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,999
Is it about the museum site
development rights?

454
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,370
The new director Kim Da Li
did something big this time.

455
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:38,670
No wonder she's the heiress
of the Cheongsong family.

456
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,580
The heiress of the Cheongsong family.

457
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,979
I'm Song Chang Wook
from Jeil Newspaper's Cultural Bureau.

458
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,190
I'm also well acquainted
with Kim Si Hyung.

459
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm sure you have a lot to say.

460
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,600
Feel free to speak your mind.

461
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,469
He left half an hour ago,

462
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,739
so he should be there any minute.

463
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,809
I've already called the journalists,

464
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:21,479
so the media will side with him
in no time,

465
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,819
and we can go back to our real job.

466
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,029
Who is this?

467
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:35,559
Kim Hong Chun?

468
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,179
Kim Da Li of Cheongsong Gallery...

469
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,679
(Kim Da Li of Cheongsong Gallery
is an adopted child?)

470
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,048
(Will an inheritance fight
begin for the Cheongsong family?)

471
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,049
is not a biological child...

472
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,350
of the late Kim Nak Chun.

473
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,130
She doesn't have a single drop
of Cheongsong's blood.

474
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:04,459
Kim Da Li was adopted.

475
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,559
Are you watching this video right now?

476
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,209
I knew it. Fate is on our side.

477
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,469
It never abandoned me.

478
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,080
How dare that adopted kid
get so cheeky with me?

479
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,950
You need to stop this now.

480
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,489
What do you mean, stop?

481
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,029
She needs to take a good blow now.

482
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,970
That way, she'll never dare
to get cheeky again.

483
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,999
Wait, did you know...

484
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,870
she had been adopted all along,

485
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,200
yet you helped that girl...

486
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:49,840
Don't you understand?

487
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,370
You need to stop Kim Si Hyung now!

488
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,809
- Stop the car.
- Why?

489
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:58,879
Why? We're almost there.

490
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,248
He told us to turn back.

491
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,249
What?

492
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,190
Man, what is this?

493
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,728
Tell them
to take the articles down now.

494
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:12,390
Upload another provocative article
or expose a scandal!

495
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,298
Do whatever it takes.

496
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,400
Yes, sir.

497
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,370
Where is Mr. Kim Hong Chun now?

498
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:22,939
When did he return to Korea?

499
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,340
Well, he...

500
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,049
(Tae Jin)

501
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,649
You can't find
Hamilton's "Smoke Series"...

502
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,450
even if you wanted to find them.

503
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,789
Let's pack up
all of Mr. Moon's works too.

504
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,789
All right.

505
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,498
The market isn't doing very well
so that can't be anywhere enough.

506
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,330
I need to pay the inheritance tax
and pay Mr. Jin back too.

507
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,670
Where are Mr. Shin Sang Woo's works?

508
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,440
You're selling
Mr. Shin Sang Woo's works too?

509
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,670
Over there.

510
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,440
My precious babies.

511
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,350
- Please be very cautious.
- Of course.

512
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,149
You have to be
extra careful with this one.

513
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,818
- This one.
- Please take this.

514
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,389
- Okay.
- That's it. Please be careful.

515
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,719
Yes, please don't
let it get scratched.

516
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,419
Please watch the edges.

517
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,059
The edges, please.

518
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,600
They took all of our best artworks.

519
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,469
These works are priceless.

520
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:29,039
Hey, you need to stop this now!

521
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,580
Uncle.

522
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,809
I'm not your uncle!

523
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,819
How dare a lowly girl like you...

524
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,850
try to sell off Cheongsong's assets?

525
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,259
What are you doing?
Put those back where they belong.

526
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,219
Now!

527
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:50,590
This one.

528
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,930
These are under seizure now.

529
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,729
If you take these,
it'll be considered theft.

530
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,998
I made myself clear.

531
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,068
Nothing that belongs
to Cheongsong will leave this place,

532
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:04,940
not even a pencil.

533
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,089
Ms. Song, did you know
Ms. Kim was adopted?

534
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:26,430
My gosh, how did she manage
to keep this so quiet?

535
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,230
So what will happen to us now?

536
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,579
Who should we put our faith in?

537
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,870
Good grief.

538
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,750
Can you hear anything?

539
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,680
Please! Keep it down.

540
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,890
You kicked Si Hyung out...

541
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,460
and became the director
of the gallery.

542
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,089
Does this make you feel like
you've become a part of the family?

543
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,430
Even beasts out in nature know...

544
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,330
how to be grateful
when someone saves them.

545
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,469
It hasn't been long
since my brother passed.

546
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,740
You sold off the house first,
didn't you?

547
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,039
And now you dare
to get into the storage...

548
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,839
of the gallery.

549
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,279
Where did you learn
to show such cheeky behavior?

550
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,878
Uncle, it's not like that...

551
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,988
If he took in
a lowly girl like you...

552
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,450
and brought you up to this day,

553
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:28,160
the least you can do is
behave like a decent human.

554
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,559
Everything you did overseas
wasn't anything important,

555
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,199
yet you didn't care
how sick your dad had been.

556
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,700
You let him be found dead
on that icy cold floor.

557
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,839
How do you call yourself a human?

558
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,040
This is...

559
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,180
why bloodlines are important.

560
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:52,279
This is why I was against it...

561
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,819
when he wanted to adopt you.

562
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,290
Even when we adopt a dog,

563
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,890
we make sure we find out
everything we can about it.

564
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,560
How unlucky do you have to be...

565
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,759
for your own parents to abandon you?

566
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,298
Ever since you became
a part of this family,

567
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:11,799
nothing went well for Cheongsong.

568
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,569
Right? My sister-in-law
suddenly passed away.

569
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,210
Then my loving brother and I...

570
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,879
became more distant
than two strangers.

571
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,250
And all those assets we had!

572
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,250
All we have now is this gallery.

573
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,350
Did you know...

574
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,020
my brother...

575
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:37,258
had to kneel down...

576
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,730
before Tae Jin?

577
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,869
Over his entire life,

578
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,469
that man never asked anyone for help.

579
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,450
But he did that before a man
who's young enough to be his son...

580
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,410
in front of a huge crowd.

581
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,339
He had to kneel down. He knelt!

582
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,279
It's all because
of someone useless like you.

583
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,279
I'll never forgive you.

584
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,660
If you have a speck of conscience,
you need to resign.

585
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,459
Don't bring more shame
to our family...

586
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,960
as you bring us
into the center of their gossip.

587
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,480
My gosh, I can't believe that man.

588
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,480
Is he really our director's brother?

589
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,020
People say words can kill.

590
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:37,619
How can he say that to her face?

591
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,059
This is why money is frightening.

592
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,180
Why do you think this happened?
It's because of money.

593
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,859
Do you think Ms. Kim is okay?

594
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,129
- Wait, give her a minute.
- Hello?

595
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,200
Who?

596
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,100
- Yes, right. Reporter Kang.
- Hello?

597
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
Yes, hello.

598
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,168
I'm sorry. Ms. Kim isn't here.

599
00:37:57,169 --> 00:37:59,169
- She's out of her office.
- Yes.

600
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,210
- Please call again later.
- Yes, right.

601
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,660
Tae Jin, don't do this.

602
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,799
Please look at me. I beg you.

603
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,370
Please...

604
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,669
Please...

605
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,580
Can you really do as I ask?

606
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,450
I can.

607
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,520
And you'll do anything?

608
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,750
Anything.

609
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,120
Then...

610
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,989
be reborn...

611
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:57,429
as the real daughter
of the Cheongsong family.

612
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,298
The phone is turned off.

613
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,358
Please leave a message.

614
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,830
Your call will be charged
after the beep.

615
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,540
It's me. Don't worry about anything.

616
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:38,439
I'm figuring everything out.
This will die down soon.

617
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,009
Da Li.

618
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,479
No matter what anyone says,
you're your father's daughter,

619
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,840
a member of the Cheongsong family.

620
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:46,480
I'll make it so.

621
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,379
I'll right this wrong
no matter what it takes.

622
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,470
So please don't hide
and pick up the phone.

623
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,869

625
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,898
I see.

626
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,068
(A van)

627
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:11,238
And the license plate number?

628
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,810
(A van)

629
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,939
I see.

630
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:18,410
Then could you send me
the CCTV footage right now?

631
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,819
Thank you. Goodbye.

632
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,919
That scumbag.

633
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:26,459
Where are you?

634
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,759
Did you hear?

635
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,430
- Did you?
- What is it this time?

636
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,390
The Cheongsong family...

637
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,560
is going to have
a huge inheritance feud.

638
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,299
- What?
- Did you know...

639
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,899
that Kim Da Li was adopted?

640
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,438
Gosh. She didn't look like...

641
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,439
someone from the orphanage.

642
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,779
Do people from the orphanage
need to have a mark or something?

643
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,620
Hey, I'm sorry.

644
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,449
Darn it.

645
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,450
I made a mistake.

646
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:57,890
What's so bad about that?

647
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,189
(Uncorrupted Police)

648
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,790
Pick up.

649
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,839
She's not at the gallery.

650
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
She also left her phone.

(Kim Nak Chun)

653
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,810
I didn't want to come here.

654
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,279
Because it'd feel like
I really lost you.

655
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:40,890
But I had nowhere else to go.

656
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Did you meet...

657
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,439
Mom?

658
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:02,710
- Me too!
- I'll give you two.

659
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,109
I'll give you two.

660
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,980
Gosh, there you were.

661
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,620
Here we go.

662
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,960
Hey, kid. Have a bite, will you?

663
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:19,390
You need to eat.

664
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:21,460
You haven't eaten in days.

665
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,270
You can read again in a bit.

666
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:29,969
Goodness.

667
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:37,410
You should never take her books,

668
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:38,950
or she'll go mad.

669
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,350
Are you okay?

670
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,329
- Hop in.
- See you again.

671
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,128
- Three, four.
- Hurry up.

672
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:58,370

673
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,910

- What?
- You are?

What's wrong?

676
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,939
Does the one-eyed monster scare you?

677
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,310
Should I hit him for you?

No!

00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,750
Don't do that!

680
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,919
I feel sorry for him.

682
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,430
loves him.

683
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,370
Just like me.

684
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:21,950

00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,290
All right.

687
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,109
I looked through the reviews.

688
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,479
And many of them complimented...

689
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,549
on how fresh and non-smelly
the meat was.

690
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:31,689
I think replacing
the broth regularly helped a ton.

691
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,059
Let's come up with a side dish...

692
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,259

for families who eat out.

- Okay.
- Okay.

00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,669
Gosh, I should wear a diaper
to my meetings from now on.

They talk so much.

696
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,570

697
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:52,809

the only daughter...)

701
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:11,579
(of the late Kim Nak Chun,
was adopted.)

702
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:15,459
She was adopted?

703
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,030
I knew it.

704
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:21,498
Rumor had it that...

705
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:23,869
her family rejected Jang Tae Jin.

706
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,808
But it was actually the opposite.

707
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,539
She was rejected
for having been adopted.

708
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,349
Right.

709
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,748

00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:35,249
Exactly.

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,780
Of course not. She may be adopted,
but she's still his daughter.

719
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,848
It's legally acceptable.

720
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:09,880
Of course.

721
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,590
Even though we're not related,

722
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,220
I consider Moo Hak my son.

723
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,689
I consider myself his mother.

724
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,660
Still...

725
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,970
I'm not sure if I want
my daughter-in-law to be adopted.

726
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,039
Isn't she better than Moo Hak?

727
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,509
Oh, please.

728
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,909
He never mentioned wanting
to get married,

729
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,150
so don't get ahead of yourself.

730
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,579
Darn it.

731
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,280
Hello, Mother. I was wondering...

732
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,349
if Da Li visited
the orphanage today.

733
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,189
I see.

734
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,260
Could you give me a call
if you find her?

735
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,829
Bye.

736
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:41,479
What are you doing here?

737
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,510
Is Da Li in there?

738
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,010
And why do you ask?

739
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,949
I couldn't get in touch with her...

740
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,426
ever since she left the gallery
this afternoon.

741
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,610
If she's not here, forget it.

742
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,189
Don't act like you care.

743
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,930
What did you say?

744
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,130
You dumped her all those years ago.
What are you doing here now?

745
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,446
Why? Did you realize
that there was no one like her?

746
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,639
Do you want her back now
because you dumped her?

747
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:12,309
Did you think...

748
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,479
she would welcome you
with arms open when you came back?

749
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:18,410
Don't fool yourself.

750
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,720
We'll take care of ourselves.

751
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,019
- You can just get lost.
- Stick to what you have to do.

752
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,550
I'll do what I have to do.

753
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,820
And Da Li is my business.

754
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:37,999
That jerk.

755
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,479
Should I escort you home?

756
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,450
Let's go back to the gallery
one last time.

Ms. Kim!

Ms. Kim!

762
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,189
I know that you're here.
Come on out now.

763
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,630
Ms. Kim.

764
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,349
Where is she?

765
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:37,519
Ms. Kim.

766
00:52:58,169 --> 00:52:59,510
Where is she hiding?

767
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,959
What is this?

768
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,660
I couldn't reach you today.

769
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:57,829
I get that you are angry.
But were you trying to drive me mad?

770
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,809
Chak Hee is just a friend.

771
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,780
I don't see her as a woman.

772
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,610
She just barged in
because something happened.

773
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,950
I can't tell you right now.
But I'll tell you everything later.

774
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,090
I'm not telling you
not because I'm hiding something.

775
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:22,260
It's just her privacy. I'm serious.

776
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:25,030
I swear. I am telling you the truth.

777
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,229
Did you not see the news today?

778
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,400
The news?

779
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:35,539
Oh, that. The one about inheritance.

780
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,840
You don't have to worry about that.

781
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:40,938
You are his daughter.
Your uncle has no right to claim...

782
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:42,680
the inheritance should be voided.

783
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,348
It will just take some time
and be a hassle. That's all.

784
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,320
You won't lose your inheritance.
Don't worry.

785
00:54:49,749 --> 00:54:50,950
It's not that.

786
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,289
I...

787
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,689
Was there something else?

788
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,499
I was adopted.

789
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,700
Did you not hear that?

790
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,570
I did.

791
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,669
That doesn't matter to you?

792
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,740
Should it?

793
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,979
Well, my brother isn't
biologically related either.

794
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,650
He's the son of the woman
my father is living with.

795
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,220
Well, he's still my brother.

796
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,599
But so what?
Just because you are adopted,

797
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,229
does that change who you are?

798
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,209
Did you not answer my calls
because of that?

799
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,009
Are you a kid?
What is this nonsense?

800
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,139
You got me all worried and anxious.

801
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,729
Ms. Kim.

802
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:08,559
When I was young,

803
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,630
I prayed every single day
my dad would die, not my mom.

804
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,300
Come here.

805
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,369
- Sir, how much longer must I wait?
- What?

806
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:24,249
Let's go to Mount Nam
for some fresh air after work today.

807
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,249
Watch your hands!

808
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,479
- I know you like it.
- Stop it.

809
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,819
I'll buy you a bag.
A designer handbag at that.

(Dondon Gamjatang)

811
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,360
A certain father
who is considered...

812
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,760
successful and respected
by society...

813
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,169
hits his daughter.

814
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,539
What was that about?

815
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:52,439
What about Moo Hak?
What will you do to him?

816
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,180
And a certain son...

817
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,249
changed his last name
to become a son of a rich man...

818
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:06,289
when his birth father
was alive and well.

819
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,360
I...

820
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,959
You know how hard I tried
to be Dad's real son.

821
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,598
I submitted the application for
permission to change remittance...

822
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,959
as soon as family law changed.

823
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,999
Do you think it was easy going from
Oh Ki Chul to Jin Ki Chul?

824
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,400
That...

825
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:26,010
was denying my identity.

826
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,010
And a certain daughter...

827
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,880
is risking everything she has...

828
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,919
for her late father.

829
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:41,220
Can you...

830
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:43,789
sell your father?

831
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:46,889
I get that you love money.

832
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,459
So will you sell your father?

833
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:52,599
The gallery is my father.

834
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,900
That's my father.

835
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:07,619
In our world, the relationships
with our parents...

836
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,680
are as diverse as the paintings.

837
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,490
That's my point.

838
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:22,530
Blood doesn't make our relationships
with our parents ideal and normal...

839
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:25,829
unlike our preconceptions.

840
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:34,309
Besides,

841
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:37,110
I sort of knew.

842
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:41,749
How?

843
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,519
Well,

844
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,519
I'm really sorry...

845
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,160
to say this about your late father.

846
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,499
You look nothing like your father.

847
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,469
I didn't see any resemblance at all.

848
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,070
Even if you were to take after your mom,
this just didn't add up.

849
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,910
Gosh. Come on.
You look nothing like him.

850
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,320

Wait, your crying face...

856
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,300
does resemble him a little.

This exhibition was that big of a hit?

861

- What are you doing?
- How do you call yourself a human?

862

I just...

863
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:51,309
He's just a puppet boss
of the gallery's cafe.

864
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,538
Don't you think he has someone
with great power behind him?

865
01:01:54,539 --> 01:01:55,539
I'm more than capable...

866
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,078
of turning this situation around.

867

Who do you think you are
to ruin my son's future?

I warned you, didn't I?
Wake up from your dream.

869
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,289
What can I say...

870
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:08,990
to console you?
