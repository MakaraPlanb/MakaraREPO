00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,410
(Does Everyone Become a Grown-Up?)

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,379
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,630
Goodness gracious.

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,340
Who was that?

5
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,590
What's all this?

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,080
Ms. Kim?

7
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,250
What are you...

8
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,190
My gosh, are you all right?

9
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,860
You startled me.

10
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,530
You can't walk into someone's house
without making a noise.

11
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,559
I'm sorry. The door was opened,
so I thought...

12
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,469
Anyway, what is it?

13
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,100
Why are you here?
And why is the house a mess?

14
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,239
I thought the thief came back.

15
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,410
It's all right.

16
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,079
Everything is okay now.

17
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,400
Why did the thief make a mess
without taking anything?

18
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,400
Maybe someone just pulled a prank.

19
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,828
It's hardly a prank.

20
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,930
The tenant came back,
so the thief ran off.

21
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,609
We'll get going.

22
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,009
Goodbye, then.

23
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,519
No.

24
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,759
A cat jumped at me. I mean it.

25
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,729
All right.

26
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,329
I'll make sure
I lock the doors well.

27
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,900
Bye.

28
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,239
Are you all right?

29
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Yes.

30
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:34,250
They said they would investigate,

31
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,949
but I'm not sure if it'll go well
because nothing is gone.

32
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,819
Does anybody know
that you're staying here?

33
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,479
Among the staff in the gallery, I mean.

34
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,560
Among the staff in the gallery?

35
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,100
No, no one knows.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,229
Is that so?

37
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,370
Why?

38
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,370
No, it's nothing.

39
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,609
Take another look.
See if anything went missing.

40
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,109
I don't think so...

41
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,930
Why did they make a huge effort
to go through everything?

42
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,489
What about my tenant?
Isn't he going to come?

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,299
He's on emergency duty,
so I didn't tell Won Tak.

44
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,229
I didn't want him to worry.

45
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,669
I see.

46
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,340
Then you should clean up
and come to my place.

47
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:32,869
You should eat dinner too.

48
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,369
Pack up what you need and come.

49
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,179
No, I'm fine now,
so you should go home, Mr. Jin.

50
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,579
No crazy man would
leave a woman he likes alone...

51
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,280
in a house with a broken lock.

52
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,950
You can be unbelievably selfish.

53
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,559
Don't be so stubborn
and come with me.

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,850
How did it go?

55
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,419
- It's not there.
- What?

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,819
I can't do this anymore.

57
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,960
Da Li almost caught me!

58
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,829
You said she'd be
out of the city on a meeting!

59
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,429
I'm guessing it got canceled.

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Why are you taking things this far
to get that thing?

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,499
If it looks like a stamp,
I doubt it's a lump of gold.

62
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Is it...

63
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,580
Uncle.

64
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,090
If you committed a crime,

65
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,288
you should pay for it.

66
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,489
No, Uncle.

67
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,859
I don't care what happens to me.

68
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,669
But what about the gallery?
What about my family?

69
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,910
Darn it, this is driving me insane.

70
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,780
She couldn't have thrown that away.

71
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,450
You've gone crazy.

72
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,450
Wait.

73
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,520
Why are you looking for that
in Ms. Kim's place?

74
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,719
What did you do to her?

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,090
What did I do?

76
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,929
My uncle brought this
upon his family.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,030
He shouldn't have been
that stubborn!

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,939
(Mr. Ha)

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,770
Darn it, this is driving me insane.

80
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,979
- Darn it!
- What are you doing? Pick up!

81
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,650
(Mr. Ha)

82
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,359
(Power Off)

83
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,129
Hey, do you have any money?

84
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,228
- You're a psycho.
- What?

85
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:12,629
Let me make this clear.

86
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,070
I don't know what you did,
but it has nothing to do with me.

87
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,369
Don't ever call me again.

88
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,990
If you do,
I'm going straight to the police.

89
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,879
Gong Ju. Hey!

90
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,609
Has she gone crazy?

91
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,280
Hey. You!

92
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,220
What did you just say?
You're going where?

93
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,149
I was way too nice, wasn't I?

94
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,189
Why?

95
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,919
Do you think I'm just saying that?

96
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,559
Should I go there now?

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,899
Let's find out
if they'll trust the barmaid...

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,030
or the druggie.

99
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,570
Be quiet.

100
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,600
I can't believe
he considered you his nephew.

101
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:55,869
You are...

102
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,609
less than human.

103
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,049
What do you expect from me?

104
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,390
What the heck do you expect from me?

105
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,489
Darn it.

106
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,530
You can put these on.

107
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,679
What are you doing? Come in.

108
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,580
Then please excuse me.

109
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,619
Sure.

110
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,929
Right. The repairman will come
to fix the door in the morning,

111
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,930
so don't worry.

112
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
You're not a picky eater, right?

113
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,399
No.

114
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,869
It's quite late,
so I'll cook a simple meal.

115
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,080
(Fifty dollars)

116
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,018
I have a painting in my living room too.
It's nice and big.

117
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,259
And I admire it every day.
Morning and night.

118
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,389
(Fifty dollars)

119
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,470
That's it.

120
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,600
The painting I told you about.

121
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,170
I see.

122
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,509
Sit down. The chair won't bite.

123
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,840
That's just a pot for doenjang.

124
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,609
It's not some fancy porcelain
from the past.

125
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
I don't have such things here.

126
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,109
But the wallpaper and the curtains
are top-notch.

127
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,879
Art is nothing special.

128
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,659
Then why did Cheongsong Gallery
send you a chamber pot?

129
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,350
When I asked, they said it was
a token of gratitude for the loan.

130
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
A chamber pot!

131
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Gosh.

132
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,330
- What?
- What?

133
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:39,540
It's a pot for doenjang.
I'm just worried it'll stink.

134
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,850
Gosh, that's hot.

135
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,420
Here we go.

136
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,759
Didn't you say you were going
to cook something simple?

137
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,259
It's simple.

138
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,029
I see no gujeolpan,
braised short ribs,

139
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,670
or octopus sticks.

140
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,170
Dig in before it gets cold.

141
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,139
This is because of the promise
you made to your mom, right?

142
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,378
What?

143
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,549
You said she was worried sick...

144
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,409
about leaving you behind.

145
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,279
She was worried
you'd skip your meals.

146
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,720
That's why you make sure to eat.

147
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,790
I didn't expect you
to remember that.

148
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,658
It must've been so difficult...

149
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:39,299
for a ten-year-old
to grow up so suddenly.

150
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,269
My dad always said...

151
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,470
a true adult never skipped meals...

152
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,080
or lost sleep.

153
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,748
I had to say goodbye to him
before I became a true adult.

154
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,820
And that...

155
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,149
breaks my heart the most.

156
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,129
We are...

157
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,629
just kids in front of our parents.

158
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:15,999
We're all...

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
just young children.

160
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,969
But you're doing your best...

161
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,440
to become an adult.

162
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,409
I'm sure he's cheering you on.

163
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,550
You said they're always watching us.

164
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,859
The food's getting cold.

165
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,619
Dig in.

166
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,029
Look. Mr. Jin.

167
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm sorry for not telling you
in advance...

168
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,769
about living with Won Tak.

169
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,769
I know very well
what you're worried about.

170
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,569
- I'll make sure you don't...
- What am I worried about?

171
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,379
- What?
- So what am I worried about?

172
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,310
You're worried about the electricity...

173
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,249
and water bills.

174
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,090
That's correct.

175
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,420
You better not waste my money.

176
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,690
Make sure you turn off your lights.

177
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,690
Of course. Don't worry.

178
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,970
Tell me.

179
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,540
Has anyone ever called you
tactless before?

180
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,369
No.

181
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:37,779
Gosh.

182
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,749
I told you that cooking
also includes washing the dishes.

183
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,019
I should earn my keep.
It'll make me feel better.

184
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,689
You can sleep...

185
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,359
I'll sleep in the bedroom.

186
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,570
It's only right for the owner
to sleep in the living room.

187
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,310
Sure. Let's do that.

188
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,169
I refuse to be
an even bigger inconvenience...

189
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,879
by watching TV
while I spend the night here.

190
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,980
I know the TV space
is the most important.

191
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,649
How considerate of you.

192
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,019
I'm truly thankful.

193
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,960
Right. I changed the bedsheets
and pillow covers today so...

194
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:34,210
Have you ever washed
the dishes before?

195
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,778
Of course. This is a simple task.

196
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,779
You just scrub them
with some dishwashing liquid...

197
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,279
and rinse them.

198
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,350
Oh, no!

199
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,359
I'm so sorry.

200
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,550
I think...

201
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,979
we need a towel.

202
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,820
How can I not worry about you?

203
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,940
And yet, you still have no idea
what I'm saying.

204
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,269
You should take that.
It's been ringing for a while.

205
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,290
Yes, I ate.

206
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:06,028
I'm really fine.

207
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,600
Don't worry about me
and focus on work.

208
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:09,869
Bye.

209
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,169
To celebrate Dondon Cart Bar's
one-year anniversary,

210
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,700
everything will be 50-percent off!

211
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,169
Today is Dondon Gamjatang's
one-year anniversary!

212
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,709
Everything will be 50-percent off!

213
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,279
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

214
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,378
- Thank you.
- Congratulations!

215
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,820
- Thank you so much.
- We should eat out today!

216
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,118
Sure!

217
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,919
- Let's have something tasty!
- Let's go!

218
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
- I'm not going to miss it.
- One, two, three!

219
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Who was that?

220
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,859
Do I know her?

221
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,500
Right. Why would she do that?

222
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,060
Is today Valentine's Day
or something?

223
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,030
Gosh.

224
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,179
Mom? It's not you, right?

225
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,300
Mom...

226
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,530
Ms. Kim.

227
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,230
- Ms. Kim.
- Mom.

228
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Ms. Kim.

229
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,439
What's wrong?

230
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,280
Did you have a nightmare?

231
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,689
I'm sorry. I knocked,

232
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:50,959
but I kept hearing you crying.

233
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,389
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,530
I must have woken you up.

235
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Are you okay?

236
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,699
No.

237
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,570
I'm not.

238
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,879
I'm not okay.

239
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,040
I'd like to apologize again
for what I did the other day.

240
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,139
I'm flattered, but I can't accept
your feelings for me.

241
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:44,510
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,339
Do you not like me
because I'm not knowledgeable?

243
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:02,090
You are very wise.

244
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,699
Do you not like me
because I'm a money-grubber?

245
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
You are helping my gallery.
I'm grateful to you.

246
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,009
You're not a money-grubber.

247
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,439
Then what am I to you?

248
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,080
Is it...

249
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,550
because of Jang Tae Jin?

250
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,320
I can't deny that.

251
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,590
I don't know how much you know
about our history.

252
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,990
But I'm scared to love again,

253
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,959
make myself vulnerable,

254
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,730
and plan a future with someone.

255
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,800
Being in love...

256
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,240
comes with a risk
for your love not being returned.

257
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:53,179
And I don't think
I can take that kind of risk again.

258
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,119
I don't know much about
this difficult concept of love.

259
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,090
But anyway,

260
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,659
at least,
you're not seeing someone else.

261
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,859
And you're not going to start
over with Jang Tae Jin either.

262
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,070
So you don't hate me,

263
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,600
find me creepy, or disgusting, right?

264
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:20,139
- Mr. Jin.
- That's all I needed to know.

265
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,339
This is quite simple.
I just like you.

266
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,340
I don't know what kind of risk
liking someone entails.

267
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:29,209
But okay.

268
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,280
It just means you are still hurting.

269
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,389
I won't rush someone who's in pain.

270
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,530
What was that?
The thing you told me before.

271
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,189
We are a friendly creditor
and debtor.

272
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:47,199
Let's go back to that for now.

273
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,000
Mr. Jin.

274
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,340
It's a long way until morning.

275
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,650
You should sleep some more.

276
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,280
This time, don't have a nightmare.

277
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,379
Oh, right.

278
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,990
I want you to know something.

279
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,590
You are...

280
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,030
much braver than
you give yourself credit for.

281
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,199
In other words, you don't give up
on something because you're scared.

282
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,890
That's what I know about you.

283
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,669
But if you're not even trying
because of someone who hurt you,

284
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,409
that doesn't sound like you even more.

285
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,550
Goodnight.

286
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,869
Love comes with a risk...

287
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,530
Love...

288
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,040
Love... Risk...

289
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,209
Love...

290
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,750
(Fifty dollars)

291
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,149
Have this sandwich at work.

292
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,549
No, I'm good.

293
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,420
Gosh, come on.

294
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,449
You didn't get any sleep last night.
You can't skip breakfast.

295
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,750
I don't feel good about that.

296
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,589
Won Tak.

297
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,130
What's going on here?

298
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Oh, no.

299
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,779
No. It's not what you think.

300
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:25,690
So nothing happened?

301
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,460
- Right.
- Are you hurt?

302
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,960
No.

303
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,759
She's lucky that
I showed up at the right time.

304
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,359
If I didn't...

305
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,000
Goodness.

306
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,670
You call this a door?
Anyone can break in.

307
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,970
Will you take responsibility
if someone breaks in?

308
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,008
Why would anyone want to break
in here?

309
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,038
There's nothing to take.

310
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,609
They'd be wasting their time.

311
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,950
What did you say?

312
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,679
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

313
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,150
Your face works as security.

314
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,759
Well,

315
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:12,069
who knew that Ms. Kim
was going to move in here?

316
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,499
Besides, how come
you never stick to something?

317
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,308
If your demand wasn't met
the first time, try again.

318
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,240
And if that didn't work,
you should try again.

319
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,950
You should have pestered me
until I changed the door for you.

320
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,049
Why didn't you insist?

321
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,650
Consider yourself lucky.

322
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,490
If there was a scratch on Da Li,

323
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,460
we would have been holding
your funeral by now.

324
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,788
Hey, why are you being
so hostile to him?

325
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,460
He helped me last night.

326
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,759
Let's go inside.

327
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,539
This isn't a simple burglary case.

328
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,269
What?

329
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,470
You should know.
You've been working as a detective.

330
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,608
The owner of Dondon F and B
lives right downstairs. Okay?

331
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,569
But the thief went
to the rooftop house over mine?

332
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,518
And it was like the thief was
looking for something specific.

333
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,789
The thief raided the entire room.

334
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,319
But not one thing went missing.

335
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,828
Look at this shabby, dirty,
and poor-looking house.

336
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,160
Wait. I'm not done yet.

337
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,568
The only valuables were the laptop
and designer handbags.

338
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,000
But they weren't stolen.

339
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:21,899
Do you think this makes sense?

340
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,839
Then what is it
if not a simple burglary case?

341
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,910
I think...

342
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,910
it's a grudge.

343
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,680
A grudge?

344
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,710
You must get a lot of resentment
for being a cop, no?

345
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:56,298
- Me?
- Try to find out...

346
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,245
if there are any recently released
female ex-convicts who hate you.

347
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,229
I bumped into someone,
and it seemed like a woman.

348
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:08,019
It could be a crime of passion.

349
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
What?

350
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,319
Is he insane?

351
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,829
I swear this house... I should move.

352
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,500
Darn it.

353
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,609
Can't you take the day off?

354
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,539
You must have been shocked.
You said you couldn't sleep.

355
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,380
I have an important meeting.

356
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Oh, right. My phone.

357
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:48,789
What's this?

358
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,599
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

359
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:04,410
Gong Ju, what happened to your ear?

360
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:08,640
I had an infection from an earring.

361
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,689
You should have been more careful.
You have to take good care of it.

362
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,690
Are you okay, Gong Ju?

363
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,970
Yes. Thank you.

364
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,000
White bouquet.

365
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,069
Right?

366
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:37,769
Excuse me?

367
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,710
It seems you only use this perfume.

368
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,799
It's a common one.

369
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,500
It's not that common. It's niche.

370
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,598
I tried to buy one but gave up.

371
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,640
It was too expensive.

372
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,069
I can buy one for you.

373
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,279
Something that suits you.

374
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,210
It was a joke.

375
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm fine.

376
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,980
I should go print the materials
for the meeting.

377
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,230
What's wrong?

378
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,630
What's Na Gong Ju like?

379
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:38,029
Pardon?

380
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,299
I have everyone else's HR profile,
but not hers.

381
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,309
Right.

382
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,109
About that...

383
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,220
My dad?

384
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,019
He personally hired Na Gong Ju?

385
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,430
We've had open recruitment
for all positions.

386
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,759
It was quite unusual.

387
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,670
And when I told him her education
and experience were all made up,

388
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,000
he said he'd take care of it...

389
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:20,339
and that the information should stay
between the two of us.

390
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,279
He even asked me
to take good care of her...

391
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,509
because she seemed to have a lot
of potential.

392
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,719
When the kids arrive,

393
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,989
they will tour the exhibition
with a docent...

394
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,920
and do activities that
Mr. Han has prepared.

395
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:39,130
For the activities,
we have origami and clay craft...

396
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Are these yours?

397
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,180
This event will be at a park
for about two hours.

398
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,118
The agenda will come to an end...

399
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,859
with the Three Frogs Restaurant program.

400
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,129
The agenda does seem a bit tight...

401
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,000
since we cut it to just one day...

402
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,199
instead of the usual two.

403
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,769
The kids might also be tired.

404
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,239
What if we put up some tents
in the museum garden...

405
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,768
and let the kids sleep there?

406
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:26,740
It could feel like camping.

407
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,150
Spending a night at a museum
is easier said than done.

408
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,579
I agree. With children,
it can be dangerous.

409
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,830
You never know where
they might run off to.

410
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,250
Are you okay, Gong Ju?

411
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:46,859
Sorry?

412
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,829
About what?

413
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,130
The children,
spending the night at the museum.

414
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,309
I think you might have some opinions
as the project manager.

415
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,009
I see.

416
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,980
About that...

417
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,150
Unfortunately, I think we
might have to pass this year...

418
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,320
for security and financial reasons.

419
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,049
Then what about a staycation?

420
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,190
Please, sit.

421
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,200
I want to put Segi's name on
something you've already done.

422
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,529
Does that make me a jerk?

423
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,439
By staycation,
do you mean staying at a hotel...

424
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,210
I thought it might be nice to give
the children a tour of Seoul.

425
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,809
Segi will pay for
all the extra cost, of course.

426
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,049
What do you say,

427
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,349
Ms. Kim Da Li?

428
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,730
You have to go through the official
steps to make suggestions like that.

429
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,500
You can't just come into the meeting room.

430
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,029
It's not just anybody. It's Segi.

431
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,769
I thought that would be the only way
for you to say yes.

432
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,210
Why would I say no?

433
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,380
What?

434
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,019
- Because...
- Last time was a personal matter.

435
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,050
Did you think I wouldn't be able
to separate that from work?

436
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,690
You also...

437
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,520
didn't suggest this hoping for
something else, I assume.

438
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,960
My bad.

439
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,560
I apologize if it made
you feel uncomfortable.

440
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,570
That's the drawing case, right?

441
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,190
The one that you've carried around
since you were a child.

442
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,820
Are there still brushes inside?

443
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,889
Drink your tea.

444
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,589
I don't have the ceremonial grade,
which I know you like.

445
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,760
But a blend is okay, right?

446
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,989
Of course.

447
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,099
I like whatever you brew.

448
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Smells good.

449
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:16,980
My thoughts haven't changed.

450
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,780
We're over.

451
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,789
Sure. I'll control my pace.

452
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,589
I was too rushed,
skipping over the part...

453
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,428
- where we actually bonded.
- Tae Jin.

454
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,549
But I at least want you to get out
of Won Tak's house.

455
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,900
Or should I move in?

456
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
You're not laughing.

457
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,309
I was joking.

458
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,989
What?

459
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,159
Kim Si Hyung has disappeared?

460
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,670
What about the thing?

461
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,809
It seemed he borrowed money
from Mr. Ha. Maybe it's him.

462
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,489
Then where could he have gone?

463
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,889
It'd be better if he turned up dead.

464
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,659
But if...

465
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,659
he is alive and says something
that he shouldn't,

466
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,928
we're done for.

467
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:44,099
Everything's done with!

468
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,039
Find him
before he messes everything up.

469
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,610
No matter what!

470
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,489
Sorry about that.

471
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,460
Did you get bad news?

472
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,800
Exactly.

473
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,329
You look like you ate poop...

474
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,440
Or stepped on it

475
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,439
You look unwell.

476
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,809
It's a lot of work
to take care of your district.

477
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,380
People call you up...

478
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,149
just because their dogs disappeared.

479
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,920
What? For their dogs?

480
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,420
Congressmen have so much work.

481
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,989
Mom.

482
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,360
Forget that. Please continue
with what you were saying.

483
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Right.

484
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,439
The government will
make the announcement...

485
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,570
a little faster than expected.

486
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:00,379
The public interest
in real estate policies is...

487
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,239
higher than it has ever been.

488
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,849
She can demand any number she wants
once the announcement is made.

489
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,969
Do you think Da Li will hand
the gallery over for a few pennies?

490
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,518
That's why I, An Sang Tae,

491
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,019
came to visit the chairman myself.

492
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,460
Let's file a lawsuit.

493
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,059
- A lawsuit?
- A lawsuit?

494
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,969
You can sue her
and make her pay her loans back.

495
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,138
Send her certified mails,
have her properties seized,

496
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,769
and nitpick over everything
you can find to get her in trouble.

497
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,380
She'll have to pay
her inheritance tax soon too.

498
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:37,050
Shake her around
and make her lose her senses.

499
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,349
And that's when...

500
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,280
we offer her
to take the gallery over.

501
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,449
Do you have...

502
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,949
enough resources?

503
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,928
Yes, well, if you're sure
this will go well.

504
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,730
Of course, this is your order.

505
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:55,829
We're done getting the money ready!

506
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,709
Here.

507
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,840
(Ilum Construction)

508
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,179
This is...

509
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:10,239
a construction company
operated by my distant relative.

510
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,449
Once the announcement is made,

511
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,179
you'll have to put in money
for the business.

512
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,349
You won't have enough time to start
a company, create a portfolio,

513
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,320
and take part in the bidding.

514
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,419
You should take that company over...

515
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,130
and split the shares by six to four.

516
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,630
Shouldn't we have
something like this...

517
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,530
to build trust between us?

518
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:35,940
There are...

519
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,610
too many traitors these days.

520
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,610
Of course.

521
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:54,090
Goodbye.

522
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,630
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

523
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,809
That thief.

524
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,579
He wants to take 40 percent
even though we paid for everything.

525
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,678
Thanks to Assemblyman An,

526
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,150
we got to take part
in this project, Dad.

527
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,948
Just be glad it wasn't five to five.

528
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:24,519
He's a very reasonable man.

529
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,949
Reasonable, my foot.

530
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,559
He's gone. Let's go back inside.

531
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,019
Do you really...

532
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,189
not have the money?

533
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,089
Sorry?

534
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,260
I mean...

535
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,229
It's just so hard to understand.

536
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:56,930
You're right.

537
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,150
There is more than meets the eye.

538
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,909
And it was like the thief was
looking for something specific.

539
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,109
The thief raided the entire room.

540
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,479
Something specific?

541
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,680
What could it be?

(Cheongsong Art Camp)

543
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,870
- Hello.
- Welcome.

544
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,869
- Goodness, welcome.
- Hello.

545
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,938
- Hello.
- This way, please.

546
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,608
- Come on in.
- Hello.

547
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,979
- Hello.
- Hello.

548
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,748
The kids are coming, so let's hurry.

549
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,149
Hurry up and fill these up.

550
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,049
Please keep it safe.

551
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,249
Who's working on this?

552
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,050
Gong Ju, ask me if you aren't sure.

553
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:57,189
Thank you for taking part
in this goodwill event.

554
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,800
Many want to help,
but only a few can actually do it.

555
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:04,605
Thank you in advance
for your hard work.

556
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:06,169
I think you're mistaken.

557
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,869
I'm the host,

558
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,140
and you're the sponsor.

562
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,720
I should be the one to thank you.

563
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,519
Thank you for your money.

564
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,990
You're a funny man.

565
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,629
I'm a pretty humorous guy.

566
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:37,870
You're here.

567
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,470
Hey, Da Li.
Thankfully, the weather is nice.

568
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:41,569
Yes.

569
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,669
- You're here, Mr. Jin.
- I am.

570
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,339
That's a cute hat.

571
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,679
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Don't mention it.

572
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,550
Let me know if you need anything.

573
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,280
We have everything here.

574
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,490
The kids are
looking forward to this.

575
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,789
Welcome to Three Frogs Restaurant.

576
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,430
Do you see
the silver platter before you?

577
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

578
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,398
In there, you'll find
this fantastic and artistic dish...

579
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:18,269
created by Leonardo Da Vinci.

580
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,208
I wonder what it'll be.

581
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,338
Do you want to know?

582
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,608
- Yes!
- Yes!

583
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:25,378
- Do you want to know?
- Yes!

584
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:27,148
If you're curious, give me 50 cents!

585
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,220
Good grief.

586
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,519
Let's find out.

587
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,390
Once I count to three,

588
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,329
you can all open it up.

589
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,430
- Okay?
- Okay.

590
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:41,728
One, two, three!

591
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:42,870
- Ta-da!
- What's this?

592
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,629
What is this?

593
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:57,249
It's weird.

594
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,318
Those are called anchovies,
Italian picked anchovies.

595
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,018
It may smell weird,
but it tastes great.

596
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,459
If you're curious,
feel free to taste it.

597
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:11,930
How is it?

598
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,559
- It's good.
- Is it?

599
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,599
- Is it good?
- Yes.

600
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,700
- Is it good? Really?
- Really?

601
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,599
- He says it's good.
- It's good.

602
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,470
It tastes like anchovies.

603
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:24,139
Goodness, but this is too harsh.

604
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,838
How could he serve only one anchovy...

605
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,639
to his guests who came hungry?

606
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,378
If he was born in this day,

607
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:32,609
he'd get stars deducted online,
forget Leonardo or whoever.

608
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,979
His business will go down.

609
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,788
Now, you won't get filled up...

610
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:41,288
by eating one anchovy.

611
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:43,559
Why don't we make
a delicious and hearty dish...

612
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,788
with our two hands
and eat that instead?

613
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:46,799
Does that sound good?

614
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,160
- Yes!
- Yes!

615
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:53,539
This is a list
of Leonardo Da Vinci's recipes.

616
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:59,680
Please modernize those dishes
and make them suitable for kids.

617
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:03,709
They'll love it
if it's made by a famous chef.

618
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,379
Let's not do that.

619
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,890
Why don't we let the kids cook?

620
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,518
- What?
- What?

621
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,760
It would be great to eat a dish
made by a famous chef,

622
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,930
but wouldn't it be better
to help them make their own food?

623
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,929
Like it or not,

624
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,700
there will come a day in your life
when you'll have to cook.

625
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,200
All right, in order to cook,
I'll need an assistant.

626
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:33,609
Let's see who looks like
the worst cook in this room.

627
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,080
Director Kim Da Li! You're it.

628
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,419
- Go, Ms. Kim!
- Give her a hand!

629
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,418
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

630
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:51,259
Goodness, what are you waiting for?

631
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,160
You're keeping the cooks
of Three Frogs Restaurant waiting!

632
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,628
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

633
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,740
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

634
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:13,319
Pour a little bit of oil
into the pan.

635
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,389
Let's stir-fry the potato first.

636
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,560
Put in the potato.

637
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,490
Let's put in onion and bacon too.

638
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:25,159
While your teachers
help you stir-fry everything,

639
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,759
you can each get the egg ready.

640
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,699
I have some eggs for you.

641
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,100
I brought some delicious
and fresh eggs.

642
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:36,239
Shake it.

643
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,009
- And drain everything.
- Okay.

644
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,010
- Okay.
- Mix it with the egg.

645
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,810
Mix it well.

646
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:46,879
- All right. Like this.
- Done!

647
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,479
We did it!

648
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,789
- Yes!
- Yes!

649
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,019
Let's go!

650
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,890
Ta-da.

651
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:56,789
It's a frog!

652
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,060
All right.

653
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,859
Goodness! It's so pretty!

654
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,640
- Look at that.
- Great job.

655
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,910
Guys.

656
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:14,510
We're all bound...

657
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,479
to be adults one day.

658
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,350
For some people,
it'll happen sooner.

659
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,680
For others, it'll take some time.

660
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:27,560
One day,
you'll have to face this world...

661
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,660
all by yourself.

662
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:34,560
Then what should you do?

663
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,899
Eat.

664
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:40,099
Make sure you eat on time...

665
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,870
even if that means
you'll be eating alone.

666
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,410
A true adult never skips meals.

667
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:53,579
All right, my little chefs.

668
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,049
Great job cooking today.

669
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,189
Well done.

670
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,289
- Good job!
- Well done!

671
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:03,089
All right. Now, leave.

672
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,129
Leave? Without eating this?

673
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,929
Just kidding! Dig in!

674
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,600
- What was that?
- Okay!

675
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:12,569
Yes! Let's eat!

676
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,100
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

677
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,280
- Try it.
- It looks scrumptious.

678
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:22,740
It looks tasty.

679
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,609
Try some.

680
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:27,748
- Goodbye.
- Was it fun?

681
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,379
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

682
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,248
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

683
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:32,619
Goodbye.

684
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,990
- Goodbye.
- Have fun.

685
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,870
We should get going.

686
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:48,539
What?

687
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,640
We can't send them to the hotel
all by themselves.

688
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,609
We should escort them.

689
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,240
Right.

690
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:58,149
Then let me just say goodbye.

691
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,879
They're waiting.

692
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,749
It's rush hour,
so we should go now. Let's go.

693
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,789
Go first. I'll catch up.

694
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,268
Thank you for today.

695
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:22,240
- Good work.
- Good work.

696
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:24,470
Do you need any help?

697
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,240
Can you clean these?

698
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,439
These?

699
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,149
Do you need my help?

(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

701
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:43,789
Ms. Na isn't here?

702
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:51,268
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

703
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:53,550
She isn't the type not to show up
to work all of a sudden.

704
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,470
Did planning for this project
take a toll on her?

705
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:57,910
She'll come.

706
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:00,609
Thanks to her wealthy parents,
she's lived a comfortable life.

707
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:02,780
She's not hardworking at all.

708
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,580
Gosh. Someone from Dondon
must've left this.

709
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:10,550
There are kitchen knives
and sauce containers.

710
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:13,288
Give it to me.
They'll come if they need to.

711
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:15,160
They'll certainly need that
for work.

712
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,330
Gosh. It's heavy.

713
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,269
Assemblyman An?

714
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,769
Why did he come over?

715
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
I'm not sure,

716
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:31,569
but those working with the director
have been quite busy.

717
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:35,379
I have no idea
what the legal team is doing either.

718
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:40,319
The legal team?

719
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:45,688
(An Chak Hee)

720
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:47,119
Watch out.

721
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,619
Someone's going to stab you
in the back.

722
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Watch out?

723
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:51,589
- My gosh!
- Oh my!

724
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,319
Gosh, look at you.

725
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:18,289
I'm loving your suit and color.

726
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:22,019
Gosh. I'm sorry,
but there's someone I like.

727
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:25,060
- Could it be Kim Da Li?
- Yes.

728
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,529
What? Don't be ridiculous.

729
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,669
You're wrong.

730
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,899
What a shame.

731
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,609
She seems to like you.

732
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:40,878
Really?

733
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:43,910
Of course not.

734
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,050
It was a lie,

735
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:47,979
darling.

736
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,459
I can't believe that woman.

737
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,100
Gosh.

738
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:07,569
Why are you avoiding me?

739
00:52:07,899 --> 00:52:09,699
I'm not avoiding you.

740
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,338
Then why haven't you been
picking up?

741
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:13,379
You also disappeared
during the opening event.

742
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,779
Do you know how many times I called?

743
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,679
Do you know how worried I was?

744
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,149
I've been a bit busy lately.

745
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,590
You're here to eat, right?

746
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:23,559
Let's go.
I'll treat you to something good.

747
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,050
Do you want to sleep with me?

748
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,189
I... I'm sorry.

749
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,669
I was just startled
by what you said.

750
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:37,899
Are you okay?

751
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,370
Why would you be so startled
when we're dating?

752
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:45,939
Were we in a relationship?

753
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,510
Since when?

754
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:49,838
I confessed my love to you...

755
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,510
and introduced you to my dad.

756
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,789
Hey, if that was the case,

757
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,950
my nickname would've been
Casa Blanca.

758
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,390
It's Casanova.

759
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:02,120
Exactly.

760
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,900
I'm sure you know this already,
but I have a killer body.

761
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:07,430
I'm not interested.

762
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,029
Everyone will say
that I deserve better.

763
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,200
That's why you shouldn't date me.

764
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:16,609
Why have you been seeing me?

765
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,608
Have you never had
the urge to touch, kiss, or sleep...

766
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:22,910
with me?

767
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,249
No. Not even once.

768
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,680
We're talking about us here.

769
00:53:28,149 --> 00:53:31,289
Didn't you say there was a line
we couldn't cross?

770
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,819
What's gotten into you?

771
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:36,019
Then...

772
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,959
is there someone else...

773
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,430
No. I don't want to hear it.
You better not answer that.

774
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,068
Leave five minutes later.

775
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,539
Don't you dare follow me.

776
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,970
Gosh.

777
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,580
Chak Hee. Hey.

778
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:00,450
Gosh.

779
00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:02,680
I don't know how...

780
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,550
I caused this misunderstanding.

781
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:08,359
But I'd like to apologize.
I'm sorry.

782
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,289
I don't want
any more misunderstandings,

783
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,700
so let's make this clear.
There's someone I like.

784
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,060
So let's not...

785
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:17,530
You scumbag.

786
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,200
Did you have to tell me that?

787
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:25,310
I told you not to answer
and to leave five minutes later.

788
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,609
Don't you know
that was why I left first?

789
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:31,709
How could you be stupid and dull?

790
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,749
And since when did you like
to make things clear?

791
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,019
Did you have to make
a fool out of me?

792
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,459
Are you really that great? Are you?

793
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,030
Come on.

794
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,269
Who was I fooling?

795
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:37,149
Who?

796
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,560
Right.

797
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:54,330
Who was I fooling?

798
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:05,069
(Tae Jin)

799
00:56:07,979 --> 00:56:08,979
Hey.

800
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:12,450
Today?

801
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:18,319
You're funding our gallery.
Of course, I should go.

802
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,990
(Dondon Gamjatang)

803
00:56:54,689 --> 00:56:57,189
What? You like food like this too.

804
00:56:58,129 --> 00:56:59,729
"Food like this?"

805
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:02,159
I thought we could dine
at a different restaurant...

806
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,970
instead of our usual type
of restaurant.

807
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,669
I hear their food is good.

808
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:28,390
What about the other people?

809
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,760
Something came up out of the blue.

810
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,550
So we'll reschedule
when they are available.

811
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,350
Besides, I just have to give you this.

812
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:42,870
So I came on their behalf.

813
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:44,846
That's the sponsorship application form.

814
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,270
We have eight people for now,
but I think two more will join.

815
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:49,680
Here's your food.

816
00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:00,419
- We're out of potatoes.
- This is for table two.

817
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,830
Tell them I gave them a lot of food.

818
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:14,399
Wait. Shouldn't you be inside?

819
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
Inside where?

820
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,938
The gallery director is here.

821
00:58:17,939 --> 00:58:20,169
Who was that?
With that annoying jerk.

822
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:22,109
You know, the guy from Segi.

823
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,600
Did you know that the name,
gamjatang, comes...

824
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,959
from the name of the bones,

825
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:43,060
not the potatoes that we know of?

826
00:58:44,669 --> 00:58:46,999
Is that so? I didn't know.

827
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:52,309
When meat was rare in Korea,
people took pork backbones...

828
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,839
the US military threw out
and started to cook with the bones.

829
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,510
I see.

830
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:02,149
This dish truly suits that guy,
Jin Moo Hak.

831
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,220
What?

832
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:10,688
The ingredient
could have been garbage,

833
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:12,729
but he made a great dish out of it.

834
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,330
He's truly amazing.
I have a lot to learn from him.

835
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,680
To be able to be this successful...

836
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,680
from the bottom,

837
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:35,318
he must have made
numerous hard decisions...

838
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:37,479
and gone through many hardships
beyond our imagination.

839
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:40,220
Whether he wanted to or not,

840
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,740
he probably had to hurt people
to get what he wanted.

841
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,560
What are you getting at?

842
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,168
Dondon F and B...

843
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:55,870
has been buying the land
surrounding the gallery.

844
00:59:57,769 --> 00:59:58,810
Did you know?

845
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:00,910
What?

846
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,839
They have been buying
every piece of land...

847
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,050
regardless of the location or the price
after your father's death.

848
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,120
I've been hearing that they plan
to buy a construction company.

849
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,959
Da Li.

850
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,359
You must think...

851
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,150
because you treat them
with good intentions,

852
01:00:24,169 --> 01:00:26,129
they will treat you the same.

853
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,669
How much do you know
about this man, Jin Moo Hak?

854
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:37,749
Is he trustworthy?

855
01:00:40,879 --> 01:00:41,979
Is he...

856
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:44,789
a good person?

857
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,289
Your fried rice is here.

858
01:01:41,609 --> 01:01:45,209
(Dali and Cocky Prince)

859
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,009
Why didn't you answer your phone?

860
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,950
Are you saying that I did something
so dirty that I must make excuses?

861
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,589
Are you saying
you're giving up the money?

862
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,588
Ms. Na just didn't go AWOL.

863
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:56,858
What are you doing to Ms. Na?

864
01:01:56,859 --> 01:01:58,729
What were you looking for
that desperately?

865
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,729
This is all I can tell you.

866
01:02:01,459 --> 01:02:03,229
Let me just stay like this for a bit.

867
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,729
You still don't see
who is on your side?

868
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:08,800
Why won't you even touch?

869
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:10,438
Tell me when you're ready.

870
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:13,208
Who said I wasn't ready?
I'm totally ready now.

871
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:15,209
I feel great physically and mentally.
