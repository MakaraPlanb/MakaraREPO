00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,768
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,640
(Does Death Mean the End?)

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,449
Be quiet.
How dare you raise your voice here?

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,850
Stop lying through your teeth.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,079
- Hey.
- Who are you?

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,589
- Hey!
- You scumbag!

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,188
- Hey.
- Get off me!

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,119
- Calm down.
- You almost punched me.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,828
- What?
- Be quiet!

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,429
- What did you say?
- I'd love to get...

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,190
settlement money
and live a comfortable life.

12
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,360
Seriously. She'd better watch out.

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,328
Once I find the girl
that reported me,

14
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,099
I'm going to punch...

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,270
What...

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,510
Say that again. What did you say?

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,349
- What did you say?
- Mr. Jin, no!

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,779
Don't do that.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,319
I should've...

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,059
just killed her back then.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,019
Please don't do anything. Please.

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,600
Darn it, man. Good grief.

23
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,230
Darn it.

24
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,969
Darn it. What a load of bull.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,609
Did you all just see that?

26
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,748
I'm never going to settle!

27
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:56,048
There are security cameras here,
so you all better make this right.

28
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,919
- Call the police again.
- You need to shut your mouth!

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,188
Let me make this clear.

30
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,760
Your sentence will go up
whenever you speak another word.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,589
- That brat...
- Special robbery and injury...

32
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,600
gets you over 3 years 6 months,
up to 7 years.

33
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,730
On top of that,
you were released last year.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,798
If you're convicted again...

35
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:16,999
after your previous crime
within three years,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,880
you're sentenced to up to ten years
or for life.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,138
The act of your crime was
taken on these cameras you love.

38
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,678
Throw in footprints,
fingerprints, and DNA.

39
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,608
There are millions of reasons
to throw you in prison.

40
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,809
However, you must know my witness
as the victim is the most essential.

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,678
Thankfully, I am acquainted
with millions of doctors.

42
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,750
Depending on your attitude,

43
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,359
the diagnosis will look
worlds different.

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,365
Let me explain it to you once again
in case you didn't understand.

45
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,958
Every single word I say will decide...

46
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,798
if you ever see the sunlight again
outside of prison.

47
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,799
Do you get it?

48
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
Yes.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Where's my money?
I'm sure you have some left.

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,579
- Well, the thing is...
- Did you use everything?

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,048
I mean, yes.

52
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,419
Only if the detective came
just a minute later.

53
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,578
I had the Eight Bright card.

54
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,719
You saw the Three Bright
in my hand, right?

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,588
Once you put them together,
you get 3-8 Brights.

56
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,858
That's the strongest hand.

57
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,328
I told you to be quiet.

58
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,100
- You! How dare you blow my money?
- Hold her back!

59
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,029
I had to pay my staff with that!
How dare you?

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,570
Hey, let go. Get off of me!
Let go of me!

61
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,440
You, come here!

62
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,810
(Episode 7)

63
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,149
No matter how angry you are,
you can't do that here.

64
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,418
If things go haywire,
you can be charged with assault.

65
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,388
If this gets reported
to the Human Rights Commission,

66
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,190
it'll get really messy.

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,489
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:46,958
The same goes for you
and your boyfriend.

69
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,230
Try to tone it down a little.

70
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,799
My boyfriend?

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,828
That guy who did fly kicks.

72
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,570
He's not my boyfriend.

73
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,169
- Is he your older brother?
- No.

74
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,738
If he's not your boyfriend
or older brother,

75
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,349
then why did he make a huge scene
in the middle of a police station?

76
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,780
You people will
get in serious trouble.

77
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,850
Try to lose your temper, okay?

79
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:18,119
All right, then. Goodbye.

80
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,560
Look at this.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
You were a police officer?

82
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,200
It's unbelievably nice
to see you here.

83
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,680
What's your relationship with her?

84
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,078
Do you ask questions
that randomly...

85
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,209
out of habit
or because of your vocation?

86
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,050
What relationship?

87
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,348
What's your relationship with Da Li?

88
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:47,490
Da Li?

89
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,088
Yes, famous people are our friends.

90
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,658
Think about it. I'm friends
with Byung Hun, Woo Sung,

91
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,328
and Bin too.

92
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,800
I wonder when Son will come back.
We should grab a meal sometime.

93
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,299
Aren't you going to answer me?

94
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,570
Look at you.

95
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,779
She's not someone you can talk about
whenever you want.

96
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,909
Won Tak.

97
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,579
- Hey, are you done?
- Yes.

98
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,019
How do you know my dear Won Tak?

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,060
My...

100
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,860
My dear Won Tak?

101
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,399
Do you two know each other?

102
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,099
Not really.

103
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,170
- He's just...
- He's my tenant.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,170
He lives on the rooftop
of my building.

105
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,369
I thought you were living alone.

106
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,739
What's it to you
if I live alone or not?

107
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,909
It's because...

108
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,149
my upstairs neighbor was
way too loud.

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,450
I see. I heard noise issues were
very serious here.

110
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,529
I hear there are people who aren't
considerate in their communities.

111
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,059
I told you that my landlord
is a crazy...

112
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,599
You have something dirty
around your mouth.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
I see.
You're my dear Won Tak's landlord.

114
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,369
I hope you treat him well.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,669
He's a vigorous, young man.

116
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,940
I hope he hasn't been too noisy.

117
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,769
I told you. He has been.

118
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,638
And that's why I couldn't sleep.

119
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,920
What are you talking about?
That's because the house is...

120
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,579
He says he's sorry
and that he'll be more careful.

121
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:24,849
When did I say that?

122
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,419
Are we done introducing ourselves?

123
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,589
Let's go home.

124
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,159
Thank you for everything, Mr. Jin.

125
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,190
Goodbye.

126
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,699
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Who is he?

127
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,098
Be quiet. I'll explain back home.

128
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,728
Don't tell anyone that we're living
together for the time being.

129
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,999
- That we're living...
- Be quiet.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Where do you think you're going?

131
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,679
Sorry?

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,979
Shouldn't you go to the gallery?

133
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,209
What about the exhibit?

134
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,719
You have several matters
to take care of.

135
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,979
Right.

136
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,750
It was nice seeing you.
I should go now.

137
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,458
I don't know where you live,

138
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,179
but until we meet again,
watch your mouth...

139
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,000
Watch the amount of noise you make.

140
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,500
What?

141
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,729
Hey, Da Li...

142
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,469
What?

143
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
What?

144
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,479
Later.

145
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,880
What's your relationship...

146
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:31,820
with your dear Won Tak?

147
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
What?

148
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,349
You two seem
to have a special relationship.

149
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,519
Well... I guess that's true.

150
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,589
It's a long story.

151
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,899
You must've gone through
more than 3,000 geops.

152
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,169
How much? 5,000 geops?

153
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,699
Or 6,000 geops? 7,000 geops?

154
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Look.

155
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,369
My dear Won Tak
is a kindhearted and decent guy.

156
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,009
He has a sense of justice,
is law-abiding,

157
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,939
honest...

158
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,949
And most of all, he's part
of the Violent Crimes Unit,

159
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,848
so thieves tend to avoid him.

160
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,219
So in a way, you have yourself
a free security service.

161
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,219
He's a great fighter too.

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,050
It's so reassuring
to have him by your side.

163
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,519
What is he? A bodyguard?

164
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm just saying that
there's no better tenant than him.

165
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,800
He's often on duty or stakeouts.

166
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,499
He's so easygoing
that he rarely takes showers.

167
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,669
How great is that?

168
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,310
You'll save on utilities.

169
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,909
You talk as if you live with him.

170
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,380
Sorry?

171
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,950
You're such a hilarious man,
Mr. Jin.

172
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,029
I'll also warn him
about the noise issues so...

173
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,530
I get it.

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,828
I can take care of my own tenant,

175
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,099
so can you please stop talking
about your dear Won Tak?

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,670
My ears are about to bleed.

177
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,099
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,739
How are your knuckles?

179
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,209
They're fine.

180
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,320
I should've beaten him to a pulp.

181
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,920
But you hugged me from behind.

182
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,958
- What?
- You startled me.

183
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,690
People were watching, you know?

184
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,160
I was merely trying to stop you
from causing bigger trouble.

185
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,400
I see.

186
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,200
You were being quite passionate.

187
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,199
That's why
you should've just left...

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,700
instead of causing
a misunderstanding.

189
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,969
That's because...

190
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,579
That's because...

191
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:44,879
I was... I was going to ask
about a rice soup restaurant.

192
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,348
- Sorry?
- There's a tasty rice soup place...

193
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,219
near the police station.

194
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,358
I was just doing some research.

195
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,859
Did you think
I went there because of you?

196
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:02,530
Also, you should never talk
like you did back there...

197
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,469
even if you're surrounded
by police officers.

198
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,009
Do you have any idea
how dangerous those men can be?

199
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,310
- I know very well.
- What?

200
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,349
You may not believe it
since he's turned into a great guy.

201
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,910
But when my dear Won Tak
used to be a troublemaker,

202
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,739
my dad and I popped by
the police station quite often.

203
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,249
You and your dear Won Tak...

204
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:24,259
We met all kinds of criminals
from petty pickpockets...

205
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,430
to gang leaders.

206
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,099
I probably know more
about them than you do.

207
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm aware that I have a pretty face,
but don't let it fool you.

208
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,310
Did you forget the tiger tattoo
I had all over my body?

209
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,679
My nickname is Majang-dong...

210
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,910
Those were stickers.

211
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,810
Who said that?

212
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:51,920
A few of its fangs and claws
were erased.

213
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,841
Did you forget what happened
in the Netherlands? During...

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,599
During the blackout?

215
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,479
You said
you had forgotten everything,

216
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,749
but I guess you still remember
every little detail.

217
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,619
Right. How could you ever forget?

218
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,660
I had a killer body.

219
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,060
A killer body?

220
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,259
Why are you laughing?

221
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm not.

222
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,999
I definitely heard you laughing.

223
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,670
You're mistaken.

224
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,609
A killer body?

225
00:11:58,249 --> 00:11:59,249
A killer...

226
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,119
I think you went
a bit overboard there.

227
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:07,859
A killer body?

228
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,599
I think that's enough.

229
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:14,430

he'll be out of her hair.

and cause this much trouble for her?

with the electrical wires,

with our VIPs yet?

Will Mr. Jang be attending
the opening ceremony?

if Minister Choi would be attending.

He's out right now?

275
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,930
Then when do you think
you can get back to us?

276
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,228
It must be
because of that news article.

277
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,998
They asked us
about who would be attending.

278
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,939
They would attend
if the other was attending.

279
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,820
They are just feeling us out
for the guest list.

280
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,669
At times like this, it'd be great
if an important figure...

281
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,439
like Director Jang would
encourage them to attend.

282
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,579
But he has a business trip
on the day of our opening.

283
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:17,019
Well, I meant...

284
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,919
we need celebrities to attend
the opening to get the word out,

285
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,949
so that way, a lot of people
would come after the opening.

Proceed with the number of guests
we planned initially.

287

- We can't disrespect our guests.
- Okay.

288
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,060
- Move out of my way.
- Goodness. Mr. Kim!

290

- Seriously?
- Gosh.

292
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:37,598
- This spot was empty.
- Come on.

293
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,339
You can just call dibs
to make it yours?

294
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,608
- I told you to move!
- Goodness.

- Yes?

This is the main spot.

300
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,095
A piece deserving of the spotlight
ought to be displayed.

301
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,519
Besides, mine is
about the same size as hers.

302
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,820
- The size?
- Yes.

303
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,589
So only the size matters?
Not the actual artwork?

304
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,498
The artwork must represent
the group exhibition.

305
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,259
Exactly. That's why it must be mine.

306
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,069
Given my international fame
and well-received artistic quality.

307
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,030

- Artistic quality?

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,869

have you opened so far?

310
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,509

311
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:21,879
What about you, Mr. Kim?

312
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,119
Were you invited to the Biennale
this year?

313
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,819
- What?
- Goodness.

314
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,218
- Ms. Yang.
- My gosh.

315
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,618
- I guess you weren't.
- Everyone was invited.

316
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,319
- You really weren't invited.
- Your artwork is famous.

Are you guys sure...

318
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,430
you want this spot?

319
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:39,829
Yes.

320
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,839
Well, we'd love to install
your piece, Mr. Kim.

321
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,540
But the color of the wall
and your piece have the same color.

322
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,169
So your artwork might not stand out.

323
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,809
Well, you should repaint the wall.

324
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,479
Tomorrow is the opening.
There isn't enough time for that.

325
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,219
Then, why don't you display mine?

326
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,419
We'd be grateful
to install your artwork too.

327
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,320
But right next to this spot...

328
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,499
Right?

329
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
You'll go back
to your initial spots, right?

330

That section is the best
for your art.

331
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,778
They are usually very polite.

332
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,808
But they get sensitive
right before the exhibitions.

333
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,920
So we haven't heard
from Ms. Hong yet?

334
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:35,420
Ms. Song went to see her
but seeing how she didn't call...

335
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,390
Shouldn't we look for
another artist now?

336
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,660
Where is her studio?

337
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,090
- Her studio?
- Yes.

338
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,610

I came here empty-handed.

354
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,680
So I'm going to buy some fruit...

355
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,279
What?

356
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,920
You're coming here now?

357
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,149
We must fix this in two hours.

358
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,390
We are literally running out of time
and don't have another alternative.

359
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,420
Okay.

360
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,670
Actually,

361
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:38,039
there was a reason behind her anger.

362
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,549
The first piece
in "The Living and The Dead" series...

363
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,680
was inspired
by alienating her late mother.

364
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,719
And that stupid man called
her precious art...

365
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,059
trash and garbage.

366
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,209
Gosh. You guys are
such a nuisance to no end.

367
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,479
Ms. Hong.

368
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,218
As for the incident this morning...

369
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,818
I bet you're sorry,
feel awful about it,

370
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,150
have nothing to say, and so on.

371
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,090
I got it. Let's cut to the chase.

372
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,529
What did you bring me?

373
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,059
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

374
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,998
After all,
this is your first exhibition...

375
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,329
as the new director.

376
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,528
But there was a disaster.

377
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,640
So I doubt that
you would come here empty-handed.

378
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,239
I'm curious to find out
what you are going...

379
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,779
to offer me.

380
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:53,149
We'll handsomely compensate
for the damage we caused.

381
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,719
The insurance company
will take care of that.

382
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,989
You said you were interested...

383
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,218
in the artist-in-residence program...

384
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,929
sponsored by Hamilton Foundation
in New York.

385
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,429
I'm fully booked until next year.

386
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,229
I'm not sure
if I'll be available for that.

387
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,340
I see. Okay.

388
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,469
Then...

389
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,238
What about a solo exhibition?

390
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,839
We'll prepare
your solo exhibition...

391
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,008
as soon as we're done
with this group exhibition.

392
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:24,609
We can't purchase
your artwork right away,

393
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,149
but we'll make sure that we do.

394
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,819
And we'll put our best people
for the private showings.

395
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,558
Will there be a next time with you?

396
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,130
I thought this would be your last.

397
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,930
Ms. Hong.

398
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,029
We will hold an exhibition
within a year.

399
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,940
As long as you're happy with us,
I'd like to prepare...

400
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:52,880
your future exhibitions myself...

401
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,340
at Cheongsong Gallery.

402
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,779
I see.

403
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,350
I read it from somewhere...

404
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,350
that people even kneel
to get what they want.

405
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,458
I see. But you are a lady
from high society,

406
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,660
so kneeling in front of others
comes at a great price.

407
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,129
Ms. Hong.

408
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,860
If I kneel,
will you agree to our term?

409
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,130
If you make demands,
it's a compromise, not begging.

410
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,239
Ms. Hong. You don't like
this kind of behavior.

411
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,169
Why are you so harsh today?

412
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,239
If this can help you feel better,

413
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,140
I don't mind kneeling
in front of you.

414
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm really sorry...

415
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,380
about today's incident.

416
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,179
Ms. Kim, please don't do that.

417
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,089
- Come on, Ms. Hong.
- Forget it.

418
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,360
I was just joking.
Don't take it so seriously.

419
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,789
Right. It must've arrived by now.

420
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,329
What kind of spell
did you put her under?

421
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,729
What made her come around?

422
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:52,600
This is amazing.

423
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,509
- Thank you.
- Okay.

424
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:13,019
Sir, let me carry that.

425
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,690
Sorry.

426
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:17,729
No. Don't worry.

427
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,459
Everything is good.

428
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,400
- Gosh. Go help him.
- What?

429
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,069
The third piece of...

430
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,110
"The Living and The Dead" series
has arrived.

431
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,549
Shouldn't you get going?

432
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,350
Thank you so much, Ms. Hong.

433
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:43,889
I didn't do it to get a thank-you.

434
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,420
If the gallery closes,
it'll be bad news for the artists.

435
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,229
So you must keep your promise. Okay?

436
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,998
You promised to hold...

437
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,568
my exhibitions next year,

438
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,299
the year after that, and so on.

439
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,239
It would be an honor.

440
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,939
Ms. Hong.

441
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,410
You're the best.

442
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,849
Let's hurry.

443
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,218
If we want to finish setting up
before the opening,

444
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,219
we are short on time.

445
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,219
- Let's go.
- By the way.

446
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,890
Who was that trashy character
this morning?

447
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,968
He's not well-versed in art,

448
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,199
but he's not a bad person.

449
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Actually, Cheongsong is
indebted to him.

450
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,410
How funny.

451
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,880
I asked who he was,

452
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,979
not whether he was a good person.

453
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:42,749
Well...

454
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,979
Congruity within incongruity.

455
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,749
You two go well together.

456
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,499
Wait up!

457
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,979
This is Mr. Jin's office
from Dondon F and B.

458
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,749
Where?

459
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:19,850
Jang Tae Jin?

460
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,850
He said he would grant you
the chance to meet him...

461
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,990
if you call him
whenever you're available.

462
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,019
Grant me?

463
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,129
He wants to talk about the debt
that Cheongsong owes.

464
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,459
Don't you think I nailed it
with my expectations this time?

465
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,370
What was it that you expected?

466
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,538
I told you before.

467
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,669
I said I thought Segi Group
would pay Cheongsong's debt.

468
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,069
Who does he think he is?

469
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,580
He's dying to pay.

470
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,179
He wants to flex.

471
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,209
Two million dollars means
nothing to Segi Group.

472
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,048
Especially now that their biggest
obstacle Kim Nak Chun has died,

473
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,690
two million is less than nothing.

474
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,860
That means we don't have
to do anything either.

475
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,929
Isn't it great?
When do you want to meet him?

476
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,289
As early as possible, I assume?

477
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,160
Tonight?

478
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,029
I'm busy.

479
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,100
Tomorrow night?

480
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,100
I'm busy tomorrow as well.

481
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,439
The day after tomorrow?

482
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,008
I said I was busy!

483
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,209
I don't have time to meet that dude!

484
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,208
And if he wants to see me,
make him come here.

485
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,450
Who is he to order me to come?

486
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:23,979
I have money too!

487
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,019
But an opportunity like this
doesn't come often.

488
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:33,259
Understood.

489
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,900
- What's that?
- Right.

490
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,728
It's the first piece
of Hong Ja Young's...

491
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,370
"The Living and The Dead" series
you purchased.

492
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,160
This is it? Just this?

493
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,129
They say inside are
explanations of her artwork...

494
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,830
and a description
of how the piece came to be.

495
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,968
They also said the first piece
of "The Living and the Dead" series...

496
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:24,909
would be unavailable for exhibition,
publication, or photography...

497
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,239
anywhere without your consent.

498
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,279
Now you're a real collector.

499
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,789
You're throwing it away?

500
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,739
That's a lot of money.

501
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,209
I...

502
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,580
I...

503
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:04,009
can't believe I bought
a 100,000-dollar piece of trash!

504
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,719
What's wrong with him?

505
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,620
Someone's calling you.
Aren't you going to answer?

506
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,330
Who is it?

507
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,629
Extremity.

508
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,630
(Eternity)

509
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:24,130
Wait, it's eternity.

510
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,709
Give it.

511
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:35,880
Jin Moo Hak speaking.

512
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,689
Put it here!

513
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,160
Everything worked out well.

514
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,959
I know you've been worried.

515
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,959
Well... A bit.

516
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,329
You have many things to worry about.

517
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,699
You shouldn't be worried about
me worrying.

518
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,839
That makes me worried.

519
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,400
That shouldn't go there.

520
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:03,410
Thank you.

521
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,310
And I'm sorry,
even though it's late.

522
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,308
Are you coming
to the opening ceremony tomorrow?

523
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:10,450
Of course!

524
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,249
I'll be there no matter what,
so you just wait.

525
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,650
Okay.

526
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:24,659
I'm not sure what harmony that is.

527
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,400
I thought she would
never change her mind.

528
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,100
By the way, will Ms. Hong be doing
the opening ceremony performance?

529
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,508
I think so. We can't get anyone
since we're short on time.

530
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,640
Sir.

531
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,708
Why are all the plastic bags...

532
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,479
- Come down.
- Oh my.

533
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,950
Goodness.

534
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,319
Is everything alright?

535
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
This is way too crumpled!

536
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,259
Make it stay exactly like this.

537
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,159
No, I mean...

538
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,859
We have issues with the direction
of the monitors.

539
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,558
I was following the design...

540
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,059
You read it wrong.

541
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,999
- I didn't...
- Look.

542
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,399
Please stay within the line.

543
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,139
No, it's too close.

544
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,840
Move it slightly this way. Good.

545
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,379
Who's in charge of this?

546
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,709
Hurry up!

547
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,849
Three per table, please.

548
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,920
Over there.

549
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,930
This is wrong.

550
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:31,728
This one has to face that way.

551
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,330
Let's put it back down.

552
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,319
Ms. Kim?

553
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,390
Are you ready?

554
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,430
Yes.

555
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,200
Hello.

556
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,170
Are the VIP customers not here yet?

557
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,339
They all got the invitation,

558
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,840
so they will surely send someone
even if they can't make it.

559
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,009
Don't worry too much.

560
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,509
Everything will be fine.

561
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:23,386
The fact that we opened
is already incredible.

562
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,349
Honestly, I didn't think
we could make it.

563
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,449
It has to go well.

564
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,620
We've all been through so much
since Director Kim's passing.

565
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,830
Here we are.

566
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,068
Did you even advertise the event?

567
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,369
Where is everyone?

568
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,400
Can you really lose your momentum
to such an extent?

569
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:50,469
Isn't this too odd?

570
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,580
Let's go home. We did our part.

571
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,110
Where is everyone?

572
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,150
How is it possible that
not a single person showed up?

573
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,149
Where is that idiot?

574
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,620
The one time we need him,
he's not here.

575
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,360
Where is he?

576
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:42,559
We have to do something.

577
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,559
Everyone call who you can.

578
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:52,739
Wait.

579
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,539
There!

580
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,170
What?

581
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,009
What are you waiting for?
Places, everyone!

582
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,380
Let's go.

583
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,229
They're coming.

584
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,679
Look here, please.

585
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,080
Over here.

586
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,080
Welcome.

587
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,409
Look here, please.

588
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,548
Can you look here one more time?

589
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,149
Over here.

590
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,920
Thank you for coming.

591
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,690
Thank you.

592
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,229
- Oh my.
- Look here.

593
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,799
- Look over here, please.
- Thank you.

594
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,609
- Over here.
- Hello.

595
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,410
- Thank you for coming.
- This way, please.

596
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,008
Could you please wave your hand?

597
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,248
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

598
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:16,349
- Over here.
- Please look over here.

599
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,850
- Please look over here.
- Hello.

600
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,088
- Hello.
- Please wave your hands.

601
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:26,329
- Look over here.
- Thank you for coming. Hello.

602
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,600
- Thank you.
- Please look here.

603
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,399
- Please look over here.
- Hello.

604
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,710
Please show them the way.

605
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,080
Please look over here.

606
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,778
- Please show us a smile.
- Look over here.

607
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,009
- Look over here.
- Wave your hand.

608
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,319
Could you make hearts?

609
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,389
- All right!
- Thank you.

610
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,189
- Could you wave again?
- Thank you.

611
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,730
You can go in this way.

612
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:59,399
- You should say hi to him too.
- Thank you.

613
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,899
Darn it, where are
all these people coming from?

614
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,540
Darn it.

615
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,109
Hey, get me a straw.

616
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,939
Get me a straw!

617
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:20,450
Look over here.
You'll see works by Choi Jung Hwa.

618
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:24,548
As you can see here,
she made this...

619
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:26,589
by using household items.

620
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,960
You can see the philosophy
behind this artist's work.

621
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,600
Look, that's ELRIS. An idol group.

622
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:38,899
Ham Yon Ji is here too.

623
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,469
She has over a million followers.

624
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:48,480
Anyway, did we send an invitation
to ELRIS and Ms. Ham?

625
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,608
- Invitations get around.
- You're right.

626
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:55,319
Look, I've seen him on TV.
Who was he again?

627
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:57,619
- I don't know his name.
- He's an actor.

628
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,319
- Is he?
- He's not a singer?

629
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,759
This is the fanciest opening day
ever since I started here.

630
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,559
I guess Ms. Kim's marketing strategy
worked like magic.

631
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,628
Sounds great.

632
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:11,230
In my opinion, I think this is
Director Jang Tae Jin's power.

633
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,139
He's young, handsome,

634
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,239
and he's the possible successor
of Segi Group.

635
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,168
He's a divorcee too.

636
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:20,378
Anyone big in politics and business
would drool all over him,

637
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,810
as well as anyone with a daughter.

638
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,309
I get it. She's doing this again.

639
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,879
- She's so negative.
- Let's say hi to her.

640
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,519
- Hello.
- Hello.

641
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,389
We're curators
here at Cheongsong Gallery.

642
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,019
- Hello.
- It's nice to have you here.

643
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,159
- It's a lot of fun.
- You're so pretty.

644
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,159
- Yes.
- Goodness, thank you.

645
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,128
Hello, these are
the curators of the gallery.

646
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:40,129
Yes, hello.

647
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,968
- Hello.
- Weren't you going abroad for work?

648
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,099
How did you find the time?

649
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,870
It was postponed to next week.

650
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,609
It was postponed
because of their situation.

651
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,149
Did you think
I postponed it for you?

652
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:02,850
No.

653
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,620
I may be smitten with you,
but work is still work for me.

654
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,089
Let's head over there.

655
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,059
These are the people
we'll have to deal with.

656
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,600
Make sure you meet them.

657
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,529
- Chairman Choi.
- Hey.

658
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,140
"We"?

659
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:29,049
The new director, Ms. Kim Da Li.

660
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:33,480
Chairman Choi Young Man
of C and C Ventures and his wife.

661
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,620
Thank you for your time.

662
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,358
They're well-versed
in culture and arts,

663
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,660
so they'll be good sponsors.

664
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,559
Goodness, you threatened me saying
you'll never see me again...

665
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,459
unless I come here.

666
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,129
And you're now asking me to donate?

667
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,100
Goodness, you're like
a highway robber.

668
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,799
He's not a robber.
He's a romanticist.

669
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,770
I heard you postponed
your business trip to be here.

670
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,839
- Sorry?
- No, ma'am.

671
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,450
I didn't postpone it.
They postponed it first...

672
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,049
because of their situation.

673
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:07,719
Goodness, I must've made a mistake.

674
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,258
Chairman Kim!
That's Chairman Kim of Lux Hotel.

675
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,529
Let us go say hello. Let's go.

676
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,430
- Look at him.
- Chairman Kim.

677
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:21,160
What are you doing?

678
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,499
- Please meet Director Kim.
- Hello.

679
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,200
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

680
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:27,499
This is Chairman Kim of Lux Hotel.

681
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,269
So did you have a nice chat?

682
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,310
- Yes.
- We did.

683
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,819
- They're here.
- Good grief.

684
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,700
Goodness.

685
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:59,499
Why? Why do you do this?

686
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,409
Since when did our family
visit exhibitions and art galleries?

687
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,068
Why is my entire family here?

688
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,680
Think of all the money we spent.
We have to come and look.

689
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,950
Also, I should start
attending parties to get used to it.

690
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,080
It's not a party.
It's their opening event.

691
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,850
It's their grand opening?
It's not a party?

692
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,019
Who cares if this is
the opening event or a party?

693
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,890
We can use this chance
to meet new people.

694
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,829
Father, I saw on social media...

695
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,899
that all kinds
of famous people came.

696
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,330
Even the successor
of Segi Group is here.

697
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,200
That sounds wonderful.

698
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,899
It's time. We should go.

699
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,269
Anyway...

700
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,838
Once you get in there,
pretend like we're strangers.

701
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,509
We're all on our own.

702
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,980
- Let's go.
- Yes, I just arrived.

703
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,589
I told you. I made this mess,
so I'll clean it up.

704
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,450
All right, then.

705
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:55,460
Goodness.

706
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:09,749
- Stick together.
- What have you been doing?

707
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,188
They're all wonderful people.

708
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:14,430
- Do you enjoy wine?
- Wine sounds great.

709
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,299
How's your artwork coming along?

710
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,700
- Well, did you see it in there?
- I did.

711
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,169
- What did you think?
- I thought...

712
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,108
What are you doing?

713
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:30,949
Why are you so late?
I've been waiting for you.

714
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,108
Chak Hee, why are you here?

715
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:36,249
Why would a gallerist be here?
Of course, I should be here.

716
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,419
Oh, you work at a gallery, right?

717
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,189
Look at me.

718
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,149
What are you doing?

719
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,319
Stay with me.
I have to introduce you to someone.

720
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:48,129
Introduce me? To whom?

721
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:51,660
- This is excellent.
- It is.

722
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,809
- I'll get going, then.
- Yes, goodbye.

723
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,010
- All right.
- See you.

724
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,249
This is Director Kim.

725
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,260
Hey...

726
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,029
You know that you seem the coolest
when you don't say a word, right?

727
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,300
That's enough. What are you doing?

728
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,369
Just greet them,
then don't say a word.

729
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,269
I'll manage the rest. Let's go.

730
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,309
Where are we... Where are we going?

731
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,339
Just come.

732
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,390
- Where did he go?
- Calm down.

733
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,959
Goodness. Thank you.

734
00:41:58,499 --> 00:41:59,959
- Here.
- Okay.

735
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,699
How do you hit so well
with your driver?

736
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,870
You're really strong.

737
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,209
- Dad.
- Hey, Chak Hee.

738
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:14,949
A hard worker for my district,
always jolly around the year,

739
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,050
my name is An Sang Tae.

740
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,680
So who is he?

741
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:22,918
- I'm Jin Moo Hak...
- You know him too.

742
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,259
He's with Dondon F and B,

743
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,500
a company that makes
big political contributions for you.

744
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,060
I see.

745
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:31,759
Assemblyman An, hello.

746
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,999
- Goodness.
- He's my father.

747
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,870
Yes, right. Goodness.

748
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:37,800
Yes, it's an honor to meet you.

749
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:51,849
- Ma'am!
- This is fraud!

750
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,019
Get back here!

751
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:14,970
Excuse me.

752
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:17,339
Thank you.

753
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,379
Mr. Jin Moo Hak.

754
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,689
Yes?

755
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:31,689
Right.

756
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,459
I'm Jang Tae Jin of Segi Group.

757
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:37,629
I wanted to meet with you,
but you declined the offer.

758
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:41,800
Your people don't report properly.

759
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:44,939
I didn't decline it.

760
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,439
If you have business with me,
come to me...

761
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:51,609
instead of telling me
to come to you.

762
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,510
That's what I said.

763
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:58,919
I see. I just wanted
to suit your schedule.

764
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,289
I'm sorry if I sounded rude.

765
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:02,850
Suit me?

766
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,319
Sure.

767
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,089
So what is this about?

768
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,560
I heard that Da Li
is indebted to you.

769
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,930
I should've taken care of it
as soon as possible.

770
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:17,039
But we had a personal issue,

771
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:18,569
so it took longer than expected.

772
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,709
We?

773
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:22,339
Personal?

774
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,580
So?

775
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,979
So?

776
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,459
I'll pay in Cheongsong's stead.

777
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:44,430
What's it to you?

778
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:46,699
Tell me.

779
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,628
Who are you to meddle in our affair?

780
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:52,038
I refuse to watch her
being treated...

781
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:53,470
like a doormat anymore.

782
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:57,339
Men covered in tattoos
lied in her gallery.

783
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,240
The art pieces were broken.

784
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,450
And you're always keeping
an eye on her.

785
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,349
She spent all her life...

786
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,019
reading books
and learning about art.

787
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,149
She's not like you.

788
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,188
She has a strong sense
of responsibility,

789
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:12,319
so she doesn't show it.

790
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,990
But can't you see? She's struggling.

791
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:16,689
You should stop here.

792
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:18,930
Did she say...

793
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,300
that I was giving her a tough time?

794
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,039
Because she never told me so.

795
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,180
And Da Li...

796
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,510
isn't some naive kid.

797
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,919
Can't you see how well she's doing?

798
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,830
Don't make a fool
out of an intelligent woman.

799
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:55,100
It's only money.

800
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:58,740
And excessive nosiness means...

801
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:01,209
you have an ulterior motive.

802
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,439
What is it?

803
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,580
Are things not going your way?

804
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,490
Gosh. Hello?

805
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:20,760
Fine. I'm leaving right now. Bye.

806
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:25,260
I'm a bit busy.

807
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:27,499
I heard you liked money.

808
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,740
Isn't that all you want?

809
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:38,339
It's true that I love money.

810
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,209
But I don't accept donations.

811
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:43,510
I may get indigestion.

812
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,389
This is the third piece...

813
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,459
of Ms. Hong Ja Young's
"The Living and The Dead" series.

814
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:03,200
As you can see,
everything is made...

815
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:05,539
with garbage left behind
by the living.

816
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:09,410
The dead can no longer leave
behind garbage.

817
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,879
Does life always bring happiness?

818
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,019
Is death always horrible?

819
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,550
What differentiates these two?

820
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,419
Ms. Hong only learned...

821
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:30,060
about her mother's death
one month after she passed away.

822
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,629
Her late mother
didn't want to bother her...

823
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,120
while she was preparing
for an important exhibit.

824
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,999
During that one month,

825
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,740
was her mom alive...

826
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:42,709
or dead to her?

827
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:50,679
The aim of this artwork
was to make...

828
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,089
the audience think
through this experience.

829
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,088
- My gosh!
- What's going on?

830
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:58,318
Ma'am!

831
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,019
You lunatic!

832
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,629
Why in the world
are you in the coffin?

833
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,759
You're teasing me, aren't you?

834
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,429
Why would you do
something like this to me!

835
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,329
What's the matter with you?
This is what I'm supposed to do.

836
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,739
The artist told me to do this.

837
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,339
- You little...
- He's right.

838
00:48:14,209 --> 00:48:17,310
The artist had planned to do this.

839
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,648
He was handpicked today.

840
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,109
But starting from tomorrow on,
any of you can volunteer...

841
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:25,080
for this experience.

842
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:29,550
I see.

843
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,890
Go back inside.

844
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,930
Shall we move on?

845
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,140
All right.

846
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:47,839
Goodbye, sir. This way.

847
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:49,569
Let's go.

848
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,280
What?

849
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,749
You know nothing about art.

850
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,929
I thought no one would come,
but everyone came.

851
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:15,969
Gosh.

852
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,100
You were squealing when you saw KNK.

853
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,039
That's rich coming from you.
I saw what you did.

854
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,509
Since Ms. Hong had
to quickly change her artwork,

855
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,950
I thought we wouldn't have a model.

856
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,379
Me too. I was shocked
to see him in the coffin.

857
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,550
He didn't strike me
as the type to do that.

858
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,050
He just cleaned up the mess he made.

859
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,539
It's not that big of a deal.

860
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,830
Goodness.

861
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,530
Where's Ms. Kim?

862
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,260
She told us to leave first.

863
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:49,470
Today was her first exhibit
after her father's death.

864
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,869
Despite being hectic all day,

865
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,209
he popped into my head
every now and then.

866
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,609
Imagine how she felt.

867
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,689
Dad!

868
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,870
Remember I told you
that a gallery was timid yet chatty?

869
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,539
It has so many things to say,
but it's too timid to talk.

870
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:37,039
So when you're in a gallery,
you need to walk around quietly...

871
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,209
and listen
to what the pieces are saying.

872
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,609
Mr. Jin.

873
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,439
Look. My forehead is busted, right?

874
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:13,499
Don't exaggerate it now.

875
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:15,370
I'm serious!

876
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,709
Didn't you hear it crack?

877
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,080
All of a sudden,
everything went white.

878
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:22,979
When this happens,
the lack of blood can be more dangerous.

879
00:53:24,149 --> 00:53:25,249
Let me see.

880
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,490
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

881
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,289
Do you feel like throwing up?

882
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,990
Do I?

883
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,550
Anyway,
you kind of hurt my feelings.

884
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,979
You put me in the coffin
and forgot all about me.

885
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,359
Who knew that you would
fall asleep in the coffin?

886
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,589
- What? Seriously?
- Sorry.

887
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,999
You must've bought good wine.

888
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,470
I always fall asleep
when I drink expensive liquor.

889
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:20,240
Good work today.
It was tough, wasn't it?

890
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,039
Well,

891
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,439
it wasn't so bad.

892
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,749
Actually, going into the coffin...

893
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,249
didn't feel good.

894
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:42,160
It was cold, dark,

895
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,830
humid, and scary.

896
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,169
But when I lay down,

897
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:55,510
it was warm, soft,

898
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,979
and warm.

899
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:02,649
They might've sprayed perfume.
It smelled good too.

900
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,620
For some reason,

901
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:09,550
it made me feel relieved.

902
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,390
It was comforting.

903
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,740
My mother passed away
on a very cold day.

904
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,050
Gosh. This is ridiculous.

905
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:43,749
I know that
you just lost your father.

906
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,220
I'm sorry.

907
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,800
Can I ask you how old you were
when she passed away?

908
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,899
It's not some big secret.

909
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,470
She passed away when I was ten.

910
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,370
You must've been heartbroken.

911
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,379
I'm sure she will be proud to see
how kind and successful you are.

912
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:11,220
No.

913
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:14,620
I hope she doesn't.

914
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:18,890
People...

915
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:22,789
talk about how the deceased watch
over us to the end of time,

916
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,200
protect us as our guardian angels,

917
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,069
and how we'll get to see them again.

918
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,439
But I want death to be
the end of everything.

919
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,209
The end of life.

920
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:41,979
The end.

921
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:45,950
That's what I want.

922
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,260
My mother...

923
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,859
suffered way too much.

924
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:03,999
She went through so much pain
her entire life.

925
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:11,010
From what I remember,

926
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,410
she was in pain every single day.

927
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,050
She was sick.

928
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:24,560
Because
she couldn't be there for me,

929
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,419
she was heartbroken too.

930
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,699
- I washed the strawberries.
- Yes.

931
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,370
They look delicious.

932
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,039
Try it.

933
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:46,010
Hurry and eat.

934
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,720
Did you eat?

935
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:53,519
Yes.

936
00:57:54,589 --> 00:57:57,350
Don't skip your meals. Okay?

937
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,789
Even when I'm not here,

938
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,399
you must eat no matter what. Okay?

939
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,580
Eat.

940
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:41,870
Out of all days,

941
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,970
she passed away on the coldest day.

942
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,379
When we were burying her,

943
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:55,410
the ground was frozen.

944
00:58:57,379 --> 00:58:59,519
The workers kept cursing.

945
00:59:04,189 --> 00:59:07,120
She never had a ray of sunshine
in her life.

946
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,769
Her life was tough as it was.

947
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,709
She doesn't have to worry about me
even after her death.

948
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,879
Let's go.

949
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:39,789
She was probably watching
over you...

950
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:41,930
the whole time.

951
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,380
She was probably there
for every moment of your life,

952
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:50,129
rooted for you,
and worried about you.

953
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:54,479
And after seeing
how you stayed on the right path...

954
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:57,240
and have become a great man,

955
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,010
she must be happy.

956
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:34,200
(Dali and Cocky Prince)

957
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:36,608
No. Do what at the gallery?

958
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,939
Cheese cafe?

959
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,208
Why did I do that?

960
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,550
There's this magic
of an opening day.

961
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,220
You are our gallery's
true lucky charm.

962
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:49,419
What? How did you know
this was my house?

963
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:52,188
Your dog pooped!
You ought to clean it up!

964
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:55,129
- Hey. What is it?
- Sir, please drive. Let's go.

965
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,930
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Let's start over.

966
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:00,629
A mistake?

967
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,569
I never make mistakes
when it involves my mouth.
