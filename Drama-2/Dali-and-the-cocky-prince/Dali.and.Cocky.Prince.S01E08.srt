(Is It Possible to Buy
Someone's Feelings?)

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,879
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,660
The moon is bright tonight.

4
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,199
It's the streetlamp.

5
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,669
Oh, I see.

6
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:29,710
It's the streetlamp.

7
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:36,580
- Goodbye.
- Right. Goodbye.

8
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,749
Wait!

9
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:41,820
What are you doing?

10
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,290
Where are you going?

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,889
To take the bus.

12
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,089
Are you telling me...

13
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,130
to send a woman home alone
on a bus at this hour?

14
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,389
Furthermore, just a few moments ago,

15
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,899
you had something huge
happen to you.

16
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,729
What do you mean by that?

17
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,139
Get in my car.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,910
Don't make me into a bad person.

19
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,248
I'm more comfortable taking the bus.
I'll just take the bus.

20
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:10,350
No!

21
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,218
The bus station is right in front,
so you don't have to worry...

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,789
I drank.

23
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,859
What?

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,460
Are you going to let someone
who drank drive?

25
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,129
If you do,

26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,130
you'll be charged for
aiding and abetting.

27
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,249
I was turning on the navigation.

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,150
Oh, right.

29
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,989
What's the address of the friend
you've been staying with?

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,990
- Why?
- My gosh.

31
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,860
Let's go to
your friend's house first.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,230
I can call a chauffeur from there.

33
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,369
Oh, right.

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,769
- What's the address?
- You don't have to put it in!

35
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,110
I know how to get there.

36
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,779
It's not like I'm going to hurt you.

37
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,550
- Hey...
- Hey...

38
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,960
You can go first.

39
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,059
No. You can go first.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,330
It's ladies bust.

41
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
What?

42
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,869
No, I meant "ladies first."

43
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,110
Ladies first.

44
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,439
First.

45
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,640
You can go first.

46
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:52,879
Your lips...

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,680
My lips?

48
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,150
What about them?

49
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,619
Wipe them off
because you have lipstick on them.

50
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,130
We're here. You can get off.

51
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,630
Thank you.

52
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,669
- What?
- What?

53
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,549
Wait...

54
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,419
How did you know I lived here?

55
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,359
You said you lived with Won Tak.

56
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,929
You said you didn't know
where he lived.

57
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,130
Well...

58
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,739
Oh, Won Tak!

59
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,039
Hi!

60
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,380
Did you come out
to throw out the trash?

61
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,679
What's going on?

62
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,820
Mr. Jin drank, so I drove.

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
What?

64
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:37,820
No. It's not that.

65
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,389
I wanted to take her home
because it's dangerous.

66
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,259
While we're on that topic,
can you drive me home?

67
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,200
I have a friend
that I've been staying with.

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,799
My friend's house.

69
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,739
Forget it.

70
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,939
Won Tak, you can go home and rest.

71
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,238
Let's go. I'll take you home.

72
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,178
No, Mr. Jin. You drank,
so you should go in and rest.

73
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,279
Won Tak will take me home.

74
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:04,849
Right?

75
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,580
Right.

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,150
Goodbye.

77
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,589
My gosh.

78
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:28,739
Gosh.

79
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,469
"My Won Tak."

80
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,409
"My Won Tak!"

81
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,679
After kissing me just a while ago,

82
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,150
how dare she go home
arm in arm with another guy?

83
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,729
I wasn't going to brush
my teeth today.

84
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,450
Why did I do it?

85
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,950
Why?

86
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:20,659
Hormones?

87
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,130
Time of ovulation?

88
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,469
Did his tears...

89
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:32,770
pull at my heartstrings?

90
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,669
No, that's not why.

91
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,250
Then could I be...

92
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,390
Can I go in?

93
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,929
Sure. You can.

94
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,099
Are you going somewhere?

95
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,729
It's an emergency,
so I need to go right now.

96
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:11,409
I see.

97
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,609
Are you sure everything's fine?

98
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,109
Yes, it is.

99
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,020
If something is bothering you,
just tell me.

100
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,359
That time at the police station
and even just a while ago...

101
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,989
I'm suspicious of you two.

102
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,460
What do you mean?

103
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,799
Are you...

104
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:37,469
Am I...

105
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Are you being threatened by him?

106
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,169
What?

107
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,069
A threat doesn't have to be
that complicated.

108
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,578
Whether it's physical or emotional,

109
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,120
it's a threat if you feel afraid.

110
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,819
As your creditor,
he has the right to his money.

111
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,990
But he still can't mistreat you
like this.

112
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,458
Why would you drive
for that drunk scumbag?

113
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,689
Right. He's my creditor,
and I'm his debtor.

114
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,459
- What?
- You're right.

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,869
Hey. Are you even listening to me?

116
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,870
What?

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,799
Yes, I am.

118
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
Anyway,

119
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,308
even if he's your creditor,

120
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,980
don't let him walk all over you.

121
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,579
Do you need my help?

122
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,049
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

123
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,860
I'll let you know
if anything happens.

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Get it together, Da Li.

125
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,220
I can't believe this.

126
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,759
Are they seriously in line
to see our exhibition?

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
They're not our creditors?

128
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,130
I even slapped my face...

129
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,199
to check if this was a dream.

130
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,470
My gosh. What's the matter with you?

131
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,779
This isn't a dream, right?

132
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Hello, everyone.

133
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,959
Ms. Kim.

134
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,959
Congratulations.

135
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,329
Yes!

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,198
Gosh. This is a celebration!

137
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,399
Yes!

138
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,639
By the way,

139
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,808
who do you think invited
the celebrities and influencers?

140
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,078
I'm sure they heard about it.

141
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,480
Right, they probably did.

142
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,279
She has become very famous
after the press conference.

143
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,548
Tell me about it.

144
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,719
Everyone was looking up
the jewelry and dress she wore.

145
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,560
- I had never seen a star before.
- Me neither.

146
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,659
They must've had a reason
why they came.

147
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,928
If they wear a certain dress
or carry a certain bag,

148
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,799
the sales for that brand
will skyrocket.

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,630
It's all related to money. Money.

150
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,000
Was it Tae Jin?

151
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,999
Look. As someone
who's working in the arts,

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,840
you shouldn't obsess
over money too much.

153
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,539
It's true that money is important,

154
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,700
but there are many precious things
in this world that can't be bought.

155
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,909
Remember that. Okay?

156
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,749
In any case, the press conference
made them come to our exhibition...

157
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,219
without our having to pay them.

158
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,959
Gosh, she must be worth
her weight in gold.

159
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,130
You are...

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,399
our lucky charm.

161
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,028
Please don't say that.

162
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,269
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

163
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,538
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

164
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:04,970
Please stop.

165
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,209
You guys did most of the work.

166
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,379
If you're going
to be humble like that,

167
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,009
we have no choice
but to cheer even more.

168
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,048
- Let's do it.
- All right.

169
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,219
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

170
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,119
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

171
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,318
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

172
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,259
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

173
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,199
- Kim Da Li!
- Kim Da Li!

174
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:30,429
Hello.

175
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,630
- Why...
- Let's have our meeting.

176
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:33,899
We're having a meeting today?

177
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,140
- Let's go.
- Seriously?

178
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:37,970
Hold on.

179
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,779
Where's my notebook?

180
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,789
Hey.

181
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,159
Why would you push me?

182
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,999
Then we'll plan
the Cheongsong Art Camp...

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,428
with Dondon F and B.

184
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,329
I'll send the materials
over to them as soon as I'm done.

185
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll visit the orphanage myself.

186
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,169
What's next?

187
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,068
I'd like to offer
a certain service to our visitors.

188
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,678
In order to help parents
appreciate the pieces...

189
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,679
without having to worry
about their kids,

190
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,949
how about we make our own kids cafe?

191
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
That won't do.

192
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,318
Society may have become
more liberal now,

193
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,620
but what did you say? A kiss cafe?

194
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:30,730
Why do they need
to come here to kiss?

195
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,100
He meant kids cafe. Kids.

196
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,870
Was my pronunciation that bad?

197
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,809
That was a D. A kids cafe.

198
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,510
Not a kiss cafe. A kids cafe.

199
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,850
Next to contact is Keith Haring...

200
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,319
How can you kiss
without some contact?

201
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,159
Is that possible?

202
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,829
That's the artist's name.

203
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,400
Keith Haring.

204
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,829
Keith Haring?

205
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,770
What kind of name is that?

206
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,209
Are you sure it's his real name?

207
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,078
The Cheongsong workshop
that'll begin starting next week...

208
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,679
will be about poems
and famous paintings.

209
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,520
Romantic poets
such as Wordsworth, Byron...

210
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,490
And Keats.

211
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,929
Keats. Not kiss.

212
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,429
Keats.

213
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:45,928
Keats.

214
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,139
- His name is Keats.
- Keats.

215
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,909
Gosh. I'm sorry.

216
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,409
Keats.

217
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,809
Keats. I got it.

218
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,579
Go on.

219
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,900
Did you get home safe yesterday?

220
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,169
What's wrong?

221
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,640
What is it this time?

222
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:25,409
Mr. Jin.

223
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,039
I'm listening.

224
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,350
Why are you doing this?

225
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,179
Doing what?

226
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,649
If you're uncomfortable
about what happened yesterday...

227
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,749
What's there to feel
uncomfortable about?

228
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,760
It's not like...

229
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,289
we're teenagers.

230
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,459
We're two grown adults.

231
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,929
After the exhibition,
I was exhausted.

232
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,870
And due to the vibe,
I made a mistake.

233
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,400
A mistake?

234
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,279
- Discourtesy?
- Discourtesy?

235
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,850
- An incident?
- An incident?

236
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,479
Call it whatever you want,
but I'd like to apologize.

237
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,918
Let's pretend
like it never happened.

238
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,658
Can we go back to being
a friendly creditor and debtor?

239
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:16,590
Like you said, we're grown adults.
Let's be mature about it.

240
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,298
We have workers here...

241
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,928
and a ton of things to do.

242
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,270
Do you kiss men by mistake?

243
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,900
I never make mistakes with anything
that involves my mouth.

244
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,169
Eating, talking,

245
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,010
and the thing we did yesterday.

246
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,278
And what kind of mistake
is that intense...

247
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,480
It wasn't intense.

248
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,029
It wasn't a mistake for me.

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
So I want you...

250
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,539
to think it over again...

251
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,539
if the moment we shared yesterday...

252
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,140
was truly a mistake or not.

253
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,790
Goodness.

254
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:58,290
I'm sorry, sir.
This is quite a rough path.

255
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,370
I'm good.

256
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
This way, sir.

257
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,120
It's that house.

258
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,689
That's the house?

259
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,929
The rooftop of this building?

260
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,229
Yes.

261
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:39,169
That's where Joo Won Tak lives.

262
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,540
And Da Li is staying with him?

263
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,110
Yes.

264
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,150
- And...
- There's more?

265
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,019
The building owner is Jin Moo Hak.

266
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,679
The gamjatang guy?

267
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,718
Seeing how he's been living here
for a long time,

268
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,799
he probably had nothing
to do with how it turned out.

269
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,890
It seems to be a coincidence.

270
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,169
A coincidence?

271
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,469
He has a lot of ways
to get on my nerves.

272
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:20,990
(Art Galleries in Seoul)

273
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,369
No way.

274
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,398
Society may have become
more liberal now,

275
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,869
but what did you say? A kiss cafe?

276
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,139
Why do they need
to come here to kiss?

277
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,609
How can you kiss
without some contact?

278
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,710
It wasn't a mistake for me.

279
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,220
So I want you...

280
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,190
to think it over again...

281
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,260
if the moment we shared yesterday...

282
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,059
was truly a mistake or not.

283
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,030
Tae Jin?

284
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,540
Why are you here, Tae Jin?

285
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,349
I think I have
more questions than you.

286
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,019
Come on! When your dog poops,
you ought to clean that up!

287
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,489
- What is it?
- Get in.

288
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,059
- Come on! Goodness.
- What's wrong?

289
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,230
What is it?

290
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,760
Sir, please drive.

291
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,430
Go ahead.

292
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,940
Come on!

293
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,389
You can sit up now.
We turned the corner.

294
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,829
How did you know I was here?

295
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,138
Which would be harder for me?

296
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,379
To understand this situation...

297
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:24,369
or finding Won Tak's house?

298
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,109
A sponsorship association?

299
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,118
Young entrepreneurs meet up
when they have some spare time.

300
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,649
We go on yachts and play golf.
It's a social club.

301
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,249
And you know that social clubs
love a reason to get together.

302
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,640
They loved the idea of a sponsorship party
for Cheongsong.

303
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,929
As long as there's a good occasion,

304
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,929
they are willing to open up
their checkbooks.

305
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,200
Come up with a nice program.

306
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,300
It was really tough for me.

307
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,898
To prepare for this exhibition,

308
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,869
I visited a lot of people
to get sponsorships.

309
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,309
And they were
all my father's connections.

310
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,940
But all of them said
the economy was tough...

311
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:03,349
and they didn't have time.

312
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,930
It was hard
to even get a meeting with them.

313
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,819
To them, supporting
the artists wasn't the reason.

314
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,450
Your father was.

315
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,519
And after he passed away,

316
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,589
they saw no reason
to open their checkbooks.

317
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,270
There have been a lot of new players
while you were away.

318
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,070
I'll introduce them to you
one at a time.

319
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,339
Right. You're available
this weekend, right?

320
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,169
This weekend?

321
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,979
Yes. Come to our meeting
this weekend.

322
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,900
It will be a good way to meet them.
This is good.

323
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,550
What is it?
Do you already have plans?

324
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,750
I feel so pathetic.

325
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:47,900
I keep wondering
if I have always been this incompetent...

326
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,460
and if there's nothing
I can do on my own.

327
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,800
I keep getting help from you.

328
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,129
I hate myself.

329
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,168
Your father's death must have been
the hardest thing for you,

330
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,740
and you had to shoulder everything.
So you're not incompetent.

331
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,408
You gave up on your studies
which you loved...

332
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,909
and liquidated your assets.

333
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:10,109
You gave up so many things
not to give up the gallery.

334
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,819
Not everyone can do what you did.

335
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,950
You're doing a good job.

336
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,700
But where are we going now?

337
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:42,980
What is this?

338
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,119
It's the same passcode.
But I'm not sure if you remember it.

339
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,460
Let's talk inside.

340
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:29,069
I couldn't get rid of this house
because we picked it together.

341
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,230
But I couldn't live here either.

342
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,930
Nobody knows about this place
except for my secretary and me.

343
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,899
Which means it can be kept a secret.

344
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,339
Kept a secret?

345
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,940
Don't think too much about it.
It's just an empty house.

346
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,010
You can come and stay
whenever you need to...

347
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,550
and leave whenever you want.

348
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,980
Or even better, don't.

349
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,629
Da Li.

350
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,629
What do you want me to do?

351
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:10,799
Just do nothing...

352
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,400
after seeing you live somewhere
that can barely be called a house?

353
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,568
I'm not buying you a house.
I can't even do this for you?

354
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,010
Even if everyone else can,

355
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,740
you shouldn't.

356
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
What?

357
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,579
You left me in the rain...

358
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,849
as if I were some contagious person
a few days before our wedding.

359
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,020
Now that I have nowhere to go,
you bring me here out of sympathy?

360
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,300
To the house we were to live in?

361
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,889
Are you being considerate?

362
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:40,300
Did you think I would be touched
if the password hadn't changed?

363
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,599
How are you so cool about this?

364
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,398
Did it mean nothing to you?

365
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:47,500
If it meant nothing,

366
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:52,069
I would never have let you
be in this position to begin with.

367
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,479
When I saw you at the funeral,

368
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,050
I wanted to stay by your side.

369
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:59,648
Don't you understand?
I've been nervous and cautious...

370
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:01,919
to make sure that you wouldn't
get hurt or run away.

371
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,290
Not because I don't
have feelings for you,

372
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:11,369
but because I didn't want to use
the situation to my advantage.

373
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:20,200
Let's start over.

374
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,740
What?

375
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:24,309
For the past five years,

376
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,809
I have never forgotten you.

377
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,579
Every day was painful...

378
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,250
because of a choice I made.

379
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:40,659
You haven't gotten over me either,
am I wrong?

380
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,230
You're right.

381
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,730
I haven't.

382
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,139
How could I, when I heard
something like that?

383
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,369
But...

384
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,980
what you couldn't do five years ago,

385
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,740
you sure you can do it now?

386
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,079
Isn't the museum
different at this hour?

387
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,220
The pictures shine more brightly
after a good night's sleep.

388
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,719
Does that mean...

389
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,320
our dates will be here at this time
every day once we get married?

390
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:48,659
Every day?

391
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,460
You'll come here with me every day?

392
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,230
Of course.

393
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,270
I'll stick to you wherever you go,
like a piece of gum.

394
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,000
No matter what happens.

395
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:03,309
I'll follow you to the ends
of the earth, forever.

396
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,619
(Da Li)

397
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,230
Hey. I'm about to...

398
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,899
I'm about to head home.

399
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,230
Can I get anything on the way?

400
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,109
Where?

401
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,180
Just like when you were young.

402
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
What are you doing out here?

403
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,559
I just like this neighborhood.

404
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,829
It has a playground
and a convenience store nearby...

405
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,200
The night view
from the rooftop rocks.

406
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,609
Aren't all neighborhoods like that?

407
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,180
So come home and sleep.

408
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,118
You always sleep at the station
saying you have to work late.

409
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,520
I know it's because of me.

410
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,790
If you continue to do that,

411
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:42,089
I can't stay here.

412
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,570
Who said I was doing it for you?

413
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,230
That's what detectives do.

414
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:52,530
Did something happen today?

415
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,940
Nope.

416
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,510
For the first time in a while,

417
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:03,879
some guy kind of asked me out.

418
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,750
It felt good.

419
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,690
Kim Da Li's still got it.

420
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,659
And also...

421
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,690
some other guy...

422
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,230
proposed that I go live
somewhere really fancy.

423
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:24,970
Just a regular day.

424
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,940
One that can happen to anyone.

425
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,040
Did you see Jang Tae Jin?

426
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:34,609
Did that jerk ask you
to get back together with him?

427
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,040
To come live in his house?

428
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,648
What kind of...

429
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:41,020
So what did you say?

430
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,520
You didn't say yes, did you?

431
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,519
If he thinks less of you and thinks
it's easier to manipulate you...

432
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,819
now that Director Kim has passed,
I won't keep still.

433
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,030
Do you still have feelings for him?

434
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,808
People can't change. He's a no.

435
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,540
Tae Jin and I are over.

436
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,740
He's someone from my past.

437
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,849
When things get hard...

438
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,019
people say, "This too shall pass."

439
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,359
Pain, sadness...

440
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,120
That they'll all go away with time.

441
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,859
But if you think about it the other way,
that's a sad saying.

442
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,200
It means that the happiness...

443
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,870
and love you had...

444
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,740
will all disappear eventually.

445
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,439
Mom...

446
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:45,149
Dad...

447
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,919
Tae Jin...

448
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,030
Nothing is forever, right?

449
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,269
Won Tak.

450
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,329
Can you promise me you'll stay
for as long as you can?

451
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,879
Don't go away too fast.

452
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,720
If not, I might get too lonely.

453
00:35:57,749 --> 00:35:58,919
Hey. Hold on.

454
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,490
Whenever I see you, you're quite...

455
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,059
friendly.

456
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,740
Maybe it's because you're
a police officer.

457
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,899
About Kim Da Li.

458
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:22,839
When you took her home,

459
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,050
- did she say anything?
- What would she say?

460
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,979
For example,

461
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,450
- something about me.
- No.

462
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,119
Don't answer me right away.

463
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,189
- Think about it for a second...
- She didn't.

464
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,620
Won Tak,

465
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,429
you always give such short answers.

466
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,029
You use water and electricity
in excess,

467
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,068
but I guess you don't like
to talk excessively.

468
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,739
What? Why? I'm just saying that
you seem friendly when you do that.

469
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,870
That's what I meant.

470
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,470
If you make Da Li
chauffeur you around again,

471
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:54,180
you're dead meat.

472
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,319
Why you...

473
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,918
What do you take
the Majang-dong Fighter for?

474
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,990
If you weren't Da Li's friend...

475
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,359
The night air is nice.

476
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,579
We see each other in the office
every day.

477
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,780
Did you have to tell me to come over
on the weekend too?

478
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,160
This is against labor laws.

479
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,959
Then move back in.

480
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,100
Right.

481
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:52,330
You should eat at home
at least once a week.

482
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,639
Ma'am. Your meal is ready.

483
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,310
Okay. Let's go.

484
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,439
Eat at home? Right.

485
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,519
Eating at home doesn't mean
it's homemade.

486
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:07,450
Do we have to taste test the food
at home too?

487
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,149
Who said this was a taste test?

488
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,089
I'm eating this because it's good.
We're not working.

489
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,619
With flavors like this,
we don't have to test it.

490
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,390
We can just go ahead
and open branches.

491
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:22,300
Gosh, this is incredible.

492
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,229
About the party.

493
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,069
When I heard it was
being hosted by Cheongsong,

494
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,140
I thought it would be incredible,

495
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,269
but I could've made better art
with my foot than what they had. Right?

496
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,409
I've never seen such a large group
of lunatics...

497
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,149
gathered in once place before.

498
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,550
A crazy brat kept screaming,

499
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:43,890
and they put a living person
in a coffin.

500
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,958
And people watched that
and clapped for them...

501
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,389
and drank.

502
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,588
It was quite a spectacle.

503
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,429
That's what art is like.

504
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,259
It's when people
who have nothing better to do...

505
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,329
show off their money.

506
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,498
Why would they show off their money?

507
00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:58,700
My gosh!

508
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,970
You didn't feel anything...

509
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:05,438
upon seeing those masterpieces?

510
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,039
- What? Masterpiece?
- What? Masterpiece?

511
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,810
Didn't you feel...

512
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,519
something burning up in here?

513
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:18,018
Something that can't be expressed
in words...

514
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:20,889
Something catches right here...

515
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,390
Get ready to catch this bone.

516
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,688
- Do you have indigestion?
- Want me to prick your fingers?

517
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:26,789
I have some medicine for GERD.

518
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,899
Go ahead and keep eating.

519
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,969
Whether I'm eating alone at home
or eating with you,

520
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,768
I'm still alone and lonely.

521
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,709
Why did I bother coming here?
My gosh.

522
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,679
If you're lonely, get married.

523
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,879
Married? With whom?
An Sang Tae's daughter?

524
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,119
An assemblyman is no big deal.

525
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,890
The one with money
has the upper hand.

526
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,289
- Oh, my. It's like Hawaii.
- Goodness.

527
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,959
- Here.
- Thank you.

528
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,330
- What is this?
- Just like this...

529
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:11,609
It's summer.

530
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,148
- You have something on your face.
- Gosh, stop.

531
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:18,609
Hold on.

532
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,978
Okay. I'll do it. I will.

533
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:23,419
Happy? I will.

534
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,189
The thing about marriage is...

535
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,129
you must marry someone you like.

536
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,999
Not someone that likes you.

537
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,970
What are you talking about?

538
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,439
What do you think?
He's talking nonsense.

539
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:51,580
Hey!

540
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,379
Take this with you.

541
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,318
(Jokbal Night Market)

542
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,279
We bought another one,
so you can have it at home.

543
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,319
This too.

544
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,358
Is it doenjang?

545
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,290
It's 100-year-old doenjang
from a head family.

546
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,559
Go home and make soup with it.

547
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,528
You should've wrapped it up
in a cloth.

548
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:10,629
This is cramping my style.

549
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,100
Hey.

550
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,990
How long are you going to leave
the gallery like that?

551
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,270
What?

552
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,209
If you keep hesitating like that,

553
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,508
someone might show up
and say they'll pay the two million.

554
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:23,680
What will you do then?

555
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:28,649
Kim Da Li won't be able
to keep the gallery.

556
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:30,918
Don't wear the poor girl down...

557
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,149
by giving her false hope.

558
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,859
Just tell her that Dondon
will take over.

559
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:38,259
What are you talking about?

560
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,960
You're not planning on breaking
even with the two million.

561
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,899
If you want the gallery,
take it from her now.

562
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,739
Do it before someone comes
and takes it first.

563
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:58,699
There's something on your jacket.

564
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,250
Bye.

565
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,680
Ms. Yeo. I need you
to look into something for me.

566
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,020
My brother?

567
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:41,790
He bought this land? Why?

568
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,859
You didn't know?

569
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,589
It's quite big.

570
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,399
Are they planning to
develop the area?

571
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,799
This is a limited development district.

572
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,739
You can say that it will
never get sold.

573
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,169
Or at least that's what I thought,
but it turned out I was wrong.

574
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,480
About 5 to 6 years ago, people
started selling and buying secretly.

575
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:08,249
But recently,
that has become more active.

576
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,850
Do you know when that started?

577
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,750
After Director Kim Nak Chun
passed away.

578
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,719
Right. You said that one time.

579
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:20,930
That there were many players
eyeing Cheongsong Gallery.

580
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,259
Where did you hear that from?

581
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,929
I guess Director Kim
was a pain in the neck...

582
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,040
for everyone who wanted
to develop the area.

583
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,338
The land for the museum
is located...

584
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,879
in the most important
part of the district,

585
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:38,749
and he had a lot of
social influence.

586
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,779
He even teamed up with NGOs
to make clear that...

587
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,319
he wouldn't let the area
get developed.

588
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,919
Apparently, he was very obstinate.

589
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,189
Kim Da Li won't be able to
keep the gallery.

590
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:54,259
If you want the gallery,
take it from her now.

591
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,029
Do it before someone comes
and takes it first.

592
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,529
But...

593
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:02,439
I did some further research
and looked at the land registers.

594
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:05,969
Do you remember the VIPs
at the opening party?

595
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,509
Their names came up often
on the list.

596
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,188
- You must've worked hard.
- Yes, of course.

597
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:23,419
It looks lovely.

598
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,230
- A goshiwon?
- Yes.

599
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,600
Why would you be interested in that?

600
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,969
I'm just curious about the cost.

601
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,640
It may vary
depending on the goshiwon.

602
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,209
But if you sell your scarf,

603
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,739
you could live there
for three months.

604
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,379
Ms. Na.

605
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,480
Did I ever offend you?

606
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,520
Why does it seem like
you always dislike me?

607
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:55,060
Have you ever thought...

608
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,259
that maybe the people around you...

609
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,029
were just overly friendly?

610
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:01,700
What?

611
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:02,899
Think about it.

612
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,699
Everyone's dying to help you out.

613
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,899
They brown-nose you
and act obsequiously.

614
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:11,219
Take the exhibition for example.

615
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,980
We pretty much prepared everything,

616
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,879
but only you were appreciated.

617
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:20,850
I envy you.

618
00:45:21,379 --> 00:45:24,180
Thanks to your family name,
you have it easy.

619
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:27,950
I'm truly sorry
if that's how you feel.

620
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,859
But Ms. Na,

621
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,259
there's always more to everything
than meets the eye.

622
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:36,299
You're right.

623
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,500
There is.

624
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,500
Hello, you're here.

625
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,509
Mr. Jin and his secretary
are slightly running late,

626
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,069
so they'll join you later.

627
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:49,540
Okay.

628
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:50,839
This way.

629
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:57,179
Three Frogs of Sandro
and Leonardo...

630
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,219
isn't just a program
where we feed the kids.

631
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,389
We aim to help them understand
Leonardo da Vinci's work...

632
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,588
by experiencing it themselves.

633
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:05,089
That's our aim.

634
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,100
We want a more realistic...

635
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,669
Hello, Ms. Song. What is it?

636
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,369
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

637
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,279
They said we didn't pay
for Ham Yon Ji's appearance.

638
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:25,480
I looked into it.

639
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,809
They're a PR company
that invites celebrities...

640
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,318
to launch parties or opening events...

641
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,089
then uploads the photos on social media.

642
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:35,520
Apparently, Dondon had hired them.

643
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,120
What should I do?

644
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,358
- This area is a green belt.
- Come in.

645
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,629
This area is the most important.

646
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,369
- I...
- Sir.

647
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,399
Yes?

648
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,379
Is the meeting already over?

649
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,210
I was just about to join you guys.

650
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,778
Would you like some tea?

651
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:02,080
It's okay. You guys can leave.

652
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,180
Yes, sir.

653
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:10,919
Sit down.

654
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:24,169
What is it?

655
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:27,370
What has drained you like this?

656
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,379
Mr. Jin.

657
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,210
I'm listening.

658
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,680
Did you hire a PR company...

659
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,480
during our opening event?

660
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,519
Did you invite idol members,
YouTubers,

661
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,760
and influencers that we didn't?

662
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:44,390
That's true. Yes. I invited them.

663
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,960
What?

664
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,169
Gosh, I thought something horrible
had happened.

665
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,370
Gosh.

666
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:59,609
Opening events have more impact
than you think.

667
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:03,679
If you're launching a new product
or opening a new business,

668
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,278
the place should be teeming
with people.

669
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:08,319
And you should tell everyone
about it.

670
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,479
Although it wasn't cheap,

671
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,750
I hired them so that
we'd be off to a good start.

672
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:17,088
We actually benefited from that.

673
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:20,060
Look. People are lining up
to see the exhibition.

674
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,929
Did you also hire
the visitors on that day?

675
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,870
Yes, I did. That didn't cost much.

676
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,269
So what if people hear the news?

677
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,100
You need to leave
behind solid proof.

678
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,809
Just line a few of them
and take some good photos,

679
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,508
and it'll look like
the place is teeming with people.

680
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,109
Why are you doing this?

681
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:41,509
Isn't it obvious?

682
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,919
To make money, of course.

683
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,790
Do you think I had money to waste?

684
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,918
Also, this is a business tactic...

685
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,088
that even vendors use to lure kids.

686
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:54,959
It's Business 101.

687
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,199
You make it sound like
it's some incredible tactic.

688
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,398
An art gallery isn't a business.

689
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:01,629
Why not? The visitors have
to purchase their tickets.

690
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,640
What's wrong? Does "business"
sound too lowly and vulgar?

691
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:08,608
Is your pride hurt...

692
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:10,039
since it's not sophisticated
or refined?

693
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,810
That's not what I mean.

694
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,608
You're deceiving the visitors.

695
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:15,878
- What a load of garbage.
- Mr. Jin.

696
00:49:15,879 --> 00:49:18,039
I thought you had learned your lesson,
but I was wrong.

697
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,088
Fine, then.

698
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:23,559
Let's forget about the profit
since you always had...

699
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,759
more than enough money.

700
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,230
But what about those art pieces
that you cherish so much?

701
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,628
Would you be content
with appreciating the pieces...

702
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:35,069
while having a party
and drinking wine?

703
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:37,239
Are you okay
not having any visitors?

704
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,439
Is it all right
if no one else sees them?

705
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,580
Didn't you say the artists
worked on those pieces for years?

706
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,778
Didn't you guys prepare...

707
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:47,979
for the exhibition
while pulling all-nighters?

708
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,879
Then shouldn't you gather
as many people as possible?

709
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:59,488
This work is by Ms. Choi Jung Hwa.

710
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:00,789
If you look here,

711
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,700
she used everyday garbage...

712
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:05,969
to create art.

713
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:07,799
And this one...

714
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,680
A dark and vacant art gallery...

715
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,950
is no different
from a charnel house.

716
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:25,790
I am aware that everything
you're saying is right.

717
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,989
But why don't I want to accept it?

718
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:31,830
It's true...

719
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,889
that we should do everything
in our power...

720
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,429
to show these great pieces
to everyone.

721
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,129
And sure. Money is important.

722
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:39,399
However,

723
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:43,239
I refuse to give money
that much power.

724
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,910
And it's neither
because of my pride...

725
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,439
nor because I'm sophisticated.

726
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,650
I just hate the fact that all
the hard work my workers...

727
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,710
have put in was disregarded
because of money.

728
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,600
It's also a shameless act
to all the other galleries.

729
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,850
If you were truly proud
of what you did,

730
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,930
then you would've told me about it.
Am I right?

731
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,430
What if that wasn't why?

732
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:17,939
What if I just wanted
to see you happy?

733
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,109
What if I wanted...

734
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,850
to see you smiling from ear to ear
like you did in the Netherlands?

735
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:36,989
Then you should've found
another way to do it.

736
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,930
Hey.

737
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:15,499
- Come here, you scumbag!
- Darn it!

738
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,830
- Hey!
- Hey, you scumbag!

739
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:20,469
Hey!

740
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:22,669
You little...

741
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,580
Let me go!

742
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:33,108
You scumbag!

743
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,350
Hey, don't you know who I am?

744
00:52:35,649 --> 00:52:37,249
I'm Kim Si Hyung,

745
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,819
the eldest son
of the Cheongsong family!

746
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,120
Exactly.

747
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,889
Why would someone so well-off...

748
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,189
borrow money then hide?

749
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,429
Why would you enrage
poor commoners like us?

750
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,000
Darn it.
It's not even that much money.

751
00:52:50,129 --> 00:52:52,429
I could easily get that money
from selling the gallery's land.

752
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,000
Poor commoners like us
wouldn't know that.

753
00:52:57,169 --> 00:53:01,239
But one thing we know
is that you're dirt poor.

754
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,410
What did you say?

755
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
I'll give you one week.

756
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,120
Bring me my money, goods,
or a goodbye letter.

757
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,450
Make sure you prepare
one of these three by then.

758
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,759
Let's go.

759
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,290
Hey, move aside.

760
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:23,159
What?

761
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,500
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

762
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,069
Is this it?

763
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:30,139
Hey, don't we need to order
more beans and other materials?

764
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,568
Have they not given us
the money yet?

765
00:53:31,569 --> 00:53:33,369
The gallery is going
to be in charge...

766
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,969
of the orders and sales.

767
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,509
They took the ledger
and the card statement.

768
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,279
Who?

769
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,450
What? The new director.

770
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:44,180
Has she gone crazy?

771
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:46,319
What about...

772
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,259
Where is it?

773
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,719
Where is it?

774
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,859
Where did you hide it?

775
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,029
Where is it?

776
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,839
Where in the world is it?

777
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,310
Hey.

778
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,270
Who are you to take the ledger?
Answer me.

779
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,209
How dare you try to run
the cafe yourself?

780
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,649
Mr. Kim, that's enough!

781
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,648
Stay out of this, old lady.
This has nothing to do with you!

782
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:16,649
Watch your mouth.

783
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:18,379
What did you say?

784
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:23,219
You can go. I'll be fine.

785
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:27,189
Okay.

786
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:34,969
Legally speaking,

787
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,000
the cafe belongs to the gallery.

788
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:41,209
I'll take care of your dwindling cafe.
Why is that a problem?

789
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,439
Your father...

790
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,080
gave me that cafe,

791
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:48,719
so I could learn
how to run the gallery.

792
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:52,048
Over you, who ran away
from your father and the gallery...

793
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:53,390
because a guy dumped you!

794
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:55,890
I guess you don't know
the full story.

795
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:59,359
But this gallery
was supposed to be mine!

796
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,460
It's very different
from what he told me.

797
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:04,929
You got expelled from school
because of a drug problem.

798
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,568
And your father disowned you.

799
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,329
As you had no money
or nothing to live for,

800
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,730
he wanted you to run the cafe,
so you'd turn over a new leaf.

801
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,710
That's what he told me.

802
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:14,739
- What?
- You get funds...

803
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:15,739
to run the cafe every month.

804
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,260
But I don't know where you spend
the funds or how much you make.

805
00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:20,810
The ledger is a mess,
and there are no reports on this.

806
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,850
My father probably...

807
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,279
overlooked this because you were
his nephew, but not anymore.

808
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,219
If you don't want that,
you can pack up and leave.

809
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,660
- How dare you?
- Si Hyung.

810
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,960
The gallery is in bad shape.

811
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,869
This isn't just my problem.
It's also yours.

812
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,200
And our family's as well.

813
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,169
You have to help me.

814
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,009
Who can I trust right now,
if not my family?

815
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,049
Exactly.

816
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,319
Hand over the gallery to me,
and just leave. Go ahead.

817
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,719
I'll make sure you get your cut
once I sell this off.

818
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,460
- What?
- Hey. Let's be honest.

819
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,189
You think it makes sense
for a girl to inherit the assets?

820
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,100
What else did you do
other than having him as your dad?

821
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,330
Let me warn you.

822
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:15,770
Don't provoke me.

823
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,770
If you do,
I don't know what I'll do next!

824
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,370
Got that?

825
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,719
Are you all right?

826
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:05,020
I'm fine.

827
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,548
Before your father passed away,

828
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:10,419
he at least pretended to work.

829
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,560
Now, he's just lost it.

830
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,799
Some people express
their sadness through rage.

831
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,600
I'm sure Si Hyung was just upset.

832
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:24,939
If he was decent enough...

833
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,439
Fine. He must be.

834
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,750
I'll take care of this.
It's all right.

835
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:39,419
Okay.

836
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,730
Did he say he was off duty today?

837
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,089
Won Tak, was today your day off?

838
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,439
Did he go to the convenience store?

839
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:27,489
(Won Tak)

840
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,629
- Hey.
- Are you home?

841
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:32,829
Yes.

842
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,799
I can't go home tonight.
Make sure to lock up.

843
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:22,609
Ms. Kim?

844
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,750
(Dali and Cocky Prince)

845
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,520
You're letting me crash here
for the night.

846
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:12,609
I should earn my keep.
It'll make me feel better.

847
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,359
How can I not worry about you?

848
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,000
Are you two living together?

849
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,329
Thank you for your service today.

850
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,628
You got that wrong.

851
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:24,398
I'm with the gallery.
And you're the sponsor.

852
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:25,909
I found out that Dondon F and B...

853
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,609
has been buying a lot of land
around the gallery.

854
01:02:28,939 --> 01:02:30,479
It is suspicious.

855
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,686
Shouldn't you give me an excuse
or explain what happened?

856
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,048
Consider it a warning.

857
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:36,049
Stay away from Da Li
when I'm still being civil.
