00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,870
Hu Ying.

3
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,750
How dare you!

4
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,229
Hu Ying. You...

5
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,430
There's something on her.

6
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,030
Search her.

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,670
No!

8
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,350
Beat her!

9
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,230
Let her go!

10
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,310
Si Yan.

11
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,710
Anyone causing trouble here

12
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,350
will be punished with being flogged 50 times,

13
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
and copying the commandments 100 times.

14
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,390
Your Highness,

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,910
Si Yan is a...

16
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,470
Shut up!

17
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,510
I believe her.

18
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,670
Si Yan.

19
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,830
Wake up, Si Yan!

20
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,430
What...

21
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,030
What's going on?

22
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,590
What did they do to her...

23
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,630
Wasn't it your order

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,070
to punish Si Yan?

25
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,670
It was.

26
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,950
Then why are you asking me?

27
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,590
Are you satisfied now?

28
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,790
I don't want to bother you.

29
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,230
Si Yan,

30
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,430
I have something important to tell you.

31
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,190
Tell her

32
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,029
when she gets well.

33
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,550
From now on,

34
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,240
I don't owe you anything.

35
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,880
You're not a princess anymore.

36
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,310
The world in the game

37
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,950
may be even more dangerous than outside.

38
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,830
Hu Ying.

39
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,070
Hu Ying, go away!

40
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,870
Don't come any closer, Hu Ying.

41
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,790
Go away from me!

42
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,510
Don't come any closer. I'll kill you.

43
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,110
Go away!

44
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,070
Go away!

45
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,230
I'll take revenge

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,750
twice as much.

47
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,190
Let's forget it.

48
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,990
Yes, Prince Bao is on her side now.

49
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,990
You can follow me or not.

50
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,120
I'll take my revenge.

51
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,510
We'll see.

52
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,190
Si Yan.

53
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,640
Where the hell did you go?

54
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,400
Your Highness,

55
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,030
I just went to check

56
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,350
Miss Min's maid Peach's room.

57
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,710
She has the same earrings.

58
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,950
But it was a pair.

59
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,870
But...

60
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,030
But what?

61
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,070
But these earrings

62
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,320
are sold all over East City.

63
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,950
These double-piercing earrings are really nice.

64
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,470
Things from Treasure Pavilion
 are quite different.

65
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,240
Your Highness.

66
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,950
Overnight,

67
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,430
all the women in town are wearing the same earrings.

68
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,710
It's hard for us to follow this clue.

69
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,800
I don't think so.

70
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,030
This is not a good move.

71
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,309
It's quite suspicious instead.

72
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,110
How about

73
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,750
we just go in and ask?

74
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,110
Do you know

75
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,110
who owns this shop?

76
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,390
This is the shop of General Min,

77
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,070
the border defender.

78
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,110
Things

79
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,030
are getting complicated.

80
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,070
Have someone keep an eye on this place.

81
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,840
If there's any sign of trouble,

82
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,950
report to me as soon as possible.

83
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,870
What a beautiful day!

85
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,230
The unexpected trouble

86
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,160
gave me a moment's rest.

87
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,590
Prince Bao has saved you.

88
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,680
Do you still want to reject him?

89
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't want Lan Miao to misunderstand again.

90
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,510
Please kill

91
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,350
my romance storyline with Prince Bao.

92
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,350
Otherwise, I don't know

93
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,590
how to talk to him.

94
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,510
Why did you act tough in front of Prince Yi?

95
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,630
He...

96
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,710
Don't mention him.

97
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,630
It's all right for me to suffer a little.

98
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,120
I just can't bear this grievance.

99
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
Prince Yi has found evidence

100
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,990
to prove your innocence.

101
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,670
I have something important to tell you.

102
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,390
Tell her

103
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,040
when she gets well.

104
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,510
If he had evidence, why didn't he show it earlier?

105
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,230
I knew he was messing with me

106
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,150
and making things personal.

107
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,630
My lady,

108
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,950
it's windy this afternoon.

109
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,950
The sun is scorching.

110
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,710
As you stand on the walls of the city,

111
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,710
your skin will inevitably be dusty.

112
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,790
This Inglemirepharm Prunus mume recovery serum

113
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,110
can help clear the skin

114
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,550
and protect you from sunburn.

115
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,870
It's quite nice.

116
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,790
When I was younger,

117
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,430
I used to love riding the horse on the grassland.

118
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,110
I was young

119
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,520
and didn't know how to take care of my skin.

120
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,070
My skin

121
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,680
is not what it used to be.

122
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,200
Your Highness is so gentle and virtuous.

123
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,110
I never thought

124
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,230
you used to ride the horse on the grassland.

125
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,390
There are gains and losses.

126
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,950
Let's not talk about that.

127
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,510
Just keep these on hand for me from now on.

128
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,440
Yes, my lady.

129
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,230
Let's continue.

130
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,350
Here are air cushions and eyeshadows
 for today's live commerce.

131
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,350
This makeup could show...

132
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,590
I don't want to remember any of these.

133
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,790
When I go live later,

134
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,040
you can just write the notes on the side.

135
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,150
Otherwise, what do I need you for?

136
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,670
Okay.

137
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,590
Powder puff.

138
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,270
Here you are.

139
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,750
Try this color.

140
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,430
Thank you.

141
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,270
You seem to have changed.

142
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,750
You...

143
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,750
You know the old me?

144
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,000
No.

145
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,510
I mean

146
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,790
your make-up technique,

147
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,240
compared with that at the Flower Feast,

148
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,590
seems to have improved.

149
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,710
Phew!

150
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,270
I thought Glasses had remembered me.

151
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,920
Since I'm in the Makeup Service,

152
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,630
it's hard not to improve.

153
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,150
This is a bit different than usual.

154
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,680
When I return,

155
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,790
I'll reward you.

156
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,990
Thank you, Your Highness.

157
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,150
The makeup has been kept for a few days.

158
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm surprised it hasn't spoiled.

159
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,110
How did you do it?

160
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,510
Do you smell a hint of the clove?

161
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,870
Clove?

162
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,320
You made soup with cloves

163
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,310
and mixed it with alcohol.

164
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,710
It neutralizes the alcohol.

165
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,670
It was all thanks to your book.

166
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,950
Don't mention that book.

167
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,590
Look at my leg, it's still bandaged.

168
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,350
You're the one who made it.

169
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,870
What's the book got to do with it?

170
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,760
What's wrong?

171
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,470
I have an idea.

172
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,550
Since you can keep the makeup from spoiling,

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,350
why not strike while the iron is hot

174
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,750
and develop a set of pregnancy-safe makeup?

175
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,630
And then we can sell it at Forever Young.

176
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,750
It'll be a big seller.

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,070
You always have business savvy.

178
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,110
What are you selling?

179
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,390
It's confidential.

180
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,390
Let's go.

181
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,870
You're in business.

182
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,110
I can provide the capital.

183
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,510
The envoy has arrived.

184
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,510
Si Yan,

185
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,750
let me do it.

186
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,590
You can leave it here.

187
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,070
I'd hate to bother you.

188
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,230
Let me do the sweeping.

189
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,070
Add some strength.

190
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,350
Here, Si Yan, have some tea.

191
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,070
Good girl.

192
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,030
It's been so hot lately.

193
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,630
My face is always oily.

194
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,470
My makeup is smudged.

195
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,070
I've heard that this UNIFON purifying clay musk

196
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,310
is useful for deep cleansing and long-lasting oil control.

197
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,270
Here, put some on my face.

198
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,190
Okay.

199
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
It's so early in the morning.

200
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,070
I thought the lady of the house had arrived.

201
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,710
Turned out it was just a lowly maid.

202
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,510
What right do you have to give orders?

203
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,670
Even if you don't care that

204
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,350
the Second Lady's makeup

205
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,480
allowed her to make a splash,

206
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,670
Prince Yi did say that

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,670
if we provoke her again,

208
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,590
we'll all be dragged out of the house.

209
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,600
She's just a lowlife

210
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,710
using her master's powerful connections.

211
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,750
You...

212
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,390
Mind your words.

213
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,070
What's the point of falling in love?

214
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,750
I guess this is the best task for me.

215
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,550
It's hot and the birds are noisy.

216
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,710
Brother Yi, you're still in the mood
 to practice calligraphy.

217
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,069
What are you doing?

218
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,750
I've caught two auspicious spiders

219
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,240
and brought one to you.

220
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,710
I heard giving an auspicious spider to your loved one on Chinese Valentine's day

221
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,350
will lead to a happy marriage.

222
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,390
If Min Rui gets the spider from you,

223
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,190
she'll be delighted.

224
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,830
You're so childish.

225
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,030
I don't need it.

226
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,510
Do you not need it or

227
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,230
you just don't want to give it to Rui?

228
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,950
Girls are timid.

229
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,150
I'm afraid

230
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,510
it might scare Miss Min.

231
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,070
Won't the girl you are giving it to

232
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,470
be scared?

233
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,910
She...

234
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,760
She may not be scared.

235
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,390
You should be more concerned about yourself.

236
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,350
There are so many people involved in your affairs.

237
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,070
Giving a spider

238
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,670
may not be enough.

239
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,150
Well...

240
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,030
I'll go and catch a cuter auspicious spider

241
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,830
so as not to scare anyone.

242
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,190
Wang,

243
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,830
tell me.

244
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,950
If I hurt someone unintentionally,

245
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,590
what should I do?

246
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,040
You are so wise, brave,

247
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,910
and intelligent.

248
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,590
How could you do anything wrong?

249
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,270
You are right in everything you do.

250
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,350
Forget it.

251
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,670
Let's put it another way.

252
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,990
If

253
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,390
I have misunderstood someone unintentionally,

254
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,590
how should I make amends?

255
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,430
For me,

256
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,870
it depends on what kind of person they are.

257
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,990
How so?

258
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,510
If they are Bun or Bean,

259
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,910
who are my brothers,

260
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,400
then I'll just apologize to them.

261
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,750
But

262
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,230
for the one I love,

263
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,110
I will adapt to her taste,

264
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,790
and buy what she likes

265
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,430
to please her in every way.

266
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,070
I see.

267
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,630
Today's poems are all with "Yan" in them.

268
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,350
Let me try.

269
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,630
The willow sleeps three times a day.

270
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,230
The peach and plum are competing for beauty.

271
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,030
Brother Bao is right.

272
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,470
It's hot today.

273
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,510
Birds are noisy.

274
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,910
It's not a good day for practicing calligraphy.

275
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,390
I'll go for a walk.

276
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,630
The peach and plum are competing for beauty.

277
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,470
I was right.

278
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,710
So His Highness

279
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,550
is still thinking of that crazy girl.

280
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,350
Your Highness,

281
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,750
the First Lady asks you to go to the back garden.

282
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,150
I've asked the royal doctor.

283
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,150
He said

284
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,990
coming out for fresh air

285
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,750
will help your body recover faster.

286
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,200
But I still delayed in accompanying His Majesty

287
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,630
to meet with the envoy.

288
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,270
Fortunately, the Second Lady took the trouble to

289
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,680
help me.

290
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,600
She accompanied the King up to the city tower.

291
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,080
Otherwise,

292
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,950
it would have been a breach of etiquette.

293
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,200
Are you

294
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,830
the maid who helped the Second Lady with her makeup?

295
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,400
You did a good job.

296
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,350
Come to think of it,

297
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,630
it's been twenty years

298
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,870
since the Second Lady came to the Mansion.

299
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,160
No one has ever said

300
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,710
she looks like me.

301
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,520
It's that maid called Si Yan

302
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,230
who came up with the idea.

303
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,790
My maid has nothing to do with it.

304
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,750
Mother.

305
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,830
You came.

306
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,190
Brother Yi.

307
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,390
I've been sick.

308
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,990
I forgot to ask you.

309
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,680
You've been here for a while, haven't you?

310
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,950
You haven't been out of the Mansion yet.

311
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,110
Alright.

312
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,430
Let Qi Yi

313
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,670
take you out for a walk.

314
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,670
Brother Yi is busy with business.

315
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,080
I wonder

316
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,760
if it'll be too much trouble.

317
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,440
In a few days, we'll be celebrating Valentine's day.

318
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,830
Could I invite you

319
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,390
to enjoy the lanterns with me?

320
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,150
Thank you, Brother Yi.

321
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,710
Oiran competes for beauty.

322
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,070
That's a nice font.

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,990
Arrange the flowers later

324
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,030
and tie them around the side.

325
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,310
Keep your clothes tidy.

326
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,470
We'll have an important guest later.

327
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,990
My lord!

328
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,510
You're early.

329
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,470
The girls aren't awake yet.

330
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,350
They are awake.

331
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,390
Girls,

332
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,870
come receiving guests.

333
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,710
Come receiving guests.

334
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,870
My lord,

335
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,390
what's your preference?

336
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,560
I'll get the girls ready.

337
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,990
I want them

338
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,390
to cry.

339
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,510
I see.

340
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,630
Customers are so strange these days.

341
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,470
Exactly.

342
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,230
How can they all be unqualified?

343
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,110
My lord,

344
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,590
are you satisfied?

345
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,270
These are all the girls in your Cloud Brothel?

346
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,150
Yes.

347
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,510
You're still not satisfied?

348
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,030
None of them are to my liking.

349
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,470
We have two more girls.

350
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,710
But as luck would have it,

351
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,510
we have an important guest

352
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,590
who has made an appointment.

353
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,830
Can't you do me a favor?

354
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,510
Let me meet the girls.

355
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,790
I can only tell you

356
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,480
where they are.

357
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,230
Whether you can meet them or not

358
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,750
depends on your luck.

359
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,070
Hu Ying,

360
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,230
you came first in the last monthly exam.

361
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,030
The matrons think very highly of you.

362
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,990
Tell us more.

363
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,710
What are the questions

364
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,510
in this monthly exam?

365
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,110
Even if I get along well with the matrons,

366
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,950
they couldn't have told me this.

367
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,830
This is cheating.

368
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,150
You...

369
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,510
Don't get any bad ideas.

370
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,750
Show your strength.

371
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,270
I hope that the matrons

372
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,190
don't ask any more tricky questions.

373
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,830
What is the question in the last monthly exam?

374
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,870
"The Ten Eyebrows of the Dynasties"

375
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,470
Are we going to take the monthly exam?

376
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,310
Yes.

377
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,150
But

378
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,910
now that you can solve

379
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,870
the Second Lady's problem,

380
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,910
this monthly exam

381
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,840
will be a piece of cake for you.

382
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,350
Even the First Lady is pleased with you.

383
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,470
How did you manage to do it?

384
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,030
It's nothing.

385
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,030
There's nothing to say.

386
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,800
We'll be counting on you, Si Yan.

387
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,230
Please say more nice words about us

388
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,350
in front of the princes and ladies.

389
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,470
Yes.

390
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,550
Okay.

391
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,790
Here are the questions for this monthly exam.

392
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,030
Prepare yourselves well.

393
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,550
Yes.

394
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,510
Get out of the way!

395
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,640
Design a look for a date on Valentine's Day.

396
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,320
One of the makeup items you need

397
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,350
must be handmade.

398
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,470
The judges are the men in the East Mansion.

399
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,030
No way!

400
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,870
Those straight men?

401
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,310
Red.

402
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,790
Red.

403
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,990
Come here.

404
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,630
Prince Da,

405
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,670
I haven't seen you for a while.

406
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,990
How are you doing?

407
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,990
Today,

408
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,470
let's have some fun.

409
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,110
You...

410
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,750
He is that important guest.

411
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,670
Sit over there.

412
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,350
Pour the wine.

413
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:37,990
You...

414
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,510
You...

415
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,390
Have you noticed anything

416
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,470
d...

417
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,350
d...

418
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,510
different about me lately?

419
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,350
There's nothing different.

420
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,750
Your Highness has always been so masculine.

421
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,590
Green.

422
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,790
Green.

423
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,950
I think

424
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,870
you can speak more fluently.

425
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,910
Your stammer seems to have improved.

426
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,070
Your Highness, don't be angry.

427
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,990
My lord,

428
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,510
is that enough?

429
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,030
If not, we'll squeeze some more.

430
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,670
Qi Da.

431
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,110
Twenty-five years old.

432
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,280
His mother died when he was young.

433
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,600
He was brought up in turn by the matrons in the mansion.

434
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,280
Though not talented,

435
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,150
he is

436
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,950
studious.

437
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,230
The First Lady arranged for Qi Yi and Miss Min

438
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,510
for a boat trip at Valentine's Lantern Festival.

439
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,390
Brother Yi has the support of his mother.

440
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,070
He really has the upper hand.

441
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,990
I have no one to rely on.

442
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,750
What kind of woman would he like?

443
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,990
If I can't marry Miss Min

444
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,440
to have the support from General Min,

445
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,230
I would not be able to compete with Brother Yi.

446
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,080
With such a vast network of connections,

447
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,030
there is not a single woman

448
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,790
who is close to Qi Da.

449
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,390
Does he stutter when he gets close to women

450
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,870
because he got his heart broken before?

451
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,390
What's going on?

452
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,950
Not a single word of the procuress is true.

453
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,110
It seems we can only wait until the eve of the Valentine's day

454
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,670
to find out who the oiran is.

455
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,550
What do you want to do, Your Highness?

456
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,160
We'll do as planned.

457
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,910
Why did you come here?

458
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,160
I was afraid someone would copy my idea.

459
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,310
Your design

460
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,630
is unexpected,

461
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,440
natural and free.

462
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,230
It's a combination of the form of the Eastern Jin Dynasty

463
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,950
and the grace and elegance of the Tang Dynasty.

464
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,190
I'm sure you can do it.

465
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,950
I don't know if you're complimenting me
 or insulting me.

466
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,390
I'm sorry.

467
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,870
I should have believed in you that day.

468
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,390
You may be willful,

469
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,270
but you wouldn't hurt someone for no reason.

470
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,950
But

471
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,110
I had to find evidence

472
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,750
to prove your innocence.

473
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,070
So you left her

474
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,110
and allowed someone else to hurt her.

475
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,870
Why didn't you explain to me?

476
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,440
Have you

477
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,590
never trusted me?

478
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,950
If you had told me why you left the Mansion,

479
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,430
I would never have let them take you away.

480
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,470
If you knew her well,

481
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,670
you should have trusted her.

482
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,990
You've always tried to be brave.

483
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,350
You're so tough.

484
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,950
If you'd just give in,

485
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,310
and beg for mercy,

486
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,270
I...

487
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,080
But then

488
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,990
she wouldn't be Si Yan.

489
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,560
What are you doing here?

490
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,070
Are you taking me to jail again?

491
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,630
It was my fault that day.

492
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,990
I didn't explain clearly...

493
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,350
Let's stay here to get out of the rain.

494
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,590
This place is too small.

495
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
Since I'm staying here,

496
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,790
I'd like to ask Your Highness

497
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,150
to go somewhere else to take shelter.

498
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,870
It's pouring outside.

499
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,670
If I get wet and sick,

500
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,110
can you take responsibility for that?

501
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,830
How delicate you are!

502
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,070
Alright.

503
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,750
You stay, I'll go.

504
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,470
Don't go.

505
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,950
Stay with me.

506
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,470
What's going on?

507
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,390
Did you hear

508
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,910
some sounds?

509
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,389
What sounds?

510
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,150
It sounded like

511
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,469
a woman's cry.

512
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,550
A lady of a prestigious house

513
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,710
fell in love with a servant.

514
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,590
Her parents did not approve.

515
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,989
So they decided

516
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,989
to elope together on Valentine's Day.

517
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,230
But the boy didn't come.

518
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,750
The desperate lady disappeared.

519
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,830
The servants went looking everywhere.

520
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,670
Suddenly...

521
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,550
What happened?

522
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,800
Someone saw a white shadow

523
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,510
under the grapevine

524
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,510
floating around.

525
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,590
When he looked closer...

526
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,400
Guess what he saw.

527
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,150
What did he see?

528
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,750
Someone saw the lady's neck

529
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,120
hanging under the grapevine.

530
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,110
She committed suicide.

531
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,790
Since then,

532
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,190
every year on Valentine's Day,

533
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,510
there are men hanging under the grapevine tree.

534
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,670
It is said

535
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,710
they are killed by the ghost of the lady.

536
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,270
Boring.

537
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,640
How can you be afraid of ghosts?

538
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,990
What a shame!

539
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,390
What kind of woman would be so stupid?

540
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,430
When they meet bad men,

541
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,950
is dying the only way out?

542
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,390
Women are always conscious of their reputations.

543
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,120
If they are abandoned by men,

544
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,590
they'll inevitably be criticized.

545
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,110
If a woman's shame is overwhelming,

546
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,590
she may go too far.

547
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,110
Why would they be ashamed
 and can't live any longer

548
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,110
when they are abandoned by men?

549
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,910
I think

550
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,230
love for yourself is much more important than love for a man.

551
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,750
If you don't even love yourself,

552
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,110
who else can you expect to love you?

553
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,830
Right.

554
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,830
I can do the reverse design!

555
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,990
What is it?

556
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,790
Valentine's Day

557
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,710
is not just for girls in love,

558
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,670
but also for those who have lost their love,

559
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,760
and who are single.

560
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,750
If they cry, cry proudly.

561
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,950
I've decided on my makeup for Valentine's Day.

562
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,390
I'm going to call it "Pear Blossoms makeup".

563
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,270
No.

564
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,190
Grape Blossoms.

565
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,310
What do you think?

566
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,160
What is it?

567
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,430
What are you lining up for?

568
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,350
We're buying this limited edition gift box.

569
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,750
It's beautiful. I love it.

570
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,590
Open it.

571
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,190
It's not appropriate for me to open it.

572
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,630
Miss Min won't be happy if she finds out.

573
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,030
It has nothing to do with her.

574
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,310
Just open it.

575
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,510
I made you angry last time.

576
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,550
This...

577
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,430
Are you really going to give this to me?

578
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,510
What's wrong?

579
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,150
Isn't this color nice?

580
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,150
Which girl

581
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,030
would like such a dull color?

582
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:29,830
Take a look.

583
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,150
It's horrible.

584
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,230
I think this color is the chicest one.

585
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,590
Your Highness,

586
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,630
if you don't know how to choose, just don't do it.

587
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,440
If you have no idea,

588
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,230
you can ask me.

589
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,150
What do you mean?

590
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,670
I really suggest you

591
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,510
not give it to me.

592
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,990
If you don't like it, throw it away.

593
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,400
Just joking.

594
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,150
I know you feel guilty.

595
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,230
You bought it for me on purpose.

596
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,840
So...

597
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,120
You've forgiven me?

598
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,070
Not today.

599
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,110
Some other day.

600
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,710
I'll forgive you some other day.

601
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,670
You need another day for that?

602
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,550
I'll talk to you next time.

603
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,120
I have to prepare for my monthly exam.

604
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,870
See you.

605
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,350
Those two dressing girls are quite clever.

606
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,910
They didn't offend anyone.

607
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,230
Especially the girl called Si Yan.

608
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,230
Even Brother Yi, who is usually calm and self-possessed,

609
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,910
becomes ill at ease.

610
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,710
Very interesting.

611
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,800
And brother Bao

612
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,590
is also around her every day

613
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,190
like a bee in the bush.

614
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,080
It's like a big fight.
