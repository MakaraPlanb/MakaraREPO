1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,310
She wears the outfit of Cloud Brothel's courtesan.

3
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,900
Her death is caused by blunt force.

4
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,910
Blunt force?

5
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,390
According to Prince Xiu,

6
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,180
there are burn marks on her face.

7
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,350
Does she have scars on her face?

8
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,630
She has been soaked in water for days,

9
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,190
her face is already swollen.

10
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,390
She is unrecognizable.

11
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,910
But we found this on her.

12
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,590
This wallet has the totem 
of the Northland's Wolf King on it.

13
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,230
All the captured assassins 
committed suicide by taking poison.

14
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,990
Why was she injured by a blunt force?

15
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,590
If she was killed by an accomplice,

16
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,270
they didn't have to put this costume on her

17
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,190
to attract unnecessary attention.

18
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,390
She has nothing left

19
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,790
but this wallet.

20
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,670
It's suspicious.

21
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,910
With the clues we have now,

22
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,230
it is difficult to confirm her identity.

23
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,670
I'll send more people

24
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,150
to ask around.

25
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,870
People only believe

26
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,590
what they want to believe.

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,710
The sooner you catch the killer, the better.

28
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,190
Remember,

29
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,430
only the truth you need

30
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,350
is the truth.

31
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,350
Wait.

32
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,990
Since there are few clues,

33
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,750
don't bother.

34
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,829
Report to the King.

35
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,750
Say that the assassin courtesan
 is a Northland spy

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,740
and was murdered by her accomplices.

37
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,670
And,

38
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,790
make some burn scars on her face.

39
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,630
Eh...

40
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,630
It doesn't matter who the culprit is.

41
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,670
What matters is who finds them first.

42
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,510
Besides, if we keep investigating,

43
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,180
our plan against Yi 
on Qixi Festival might be blown.

44
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
We can't let this influence our plan.

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,270
Yes.

46
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,110
Miss, you look happy today.

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,710
Any progress on Prince Da's side?

48
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,190
Qi Da seems to be closing the case.

49
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,710
Prince Da is so wise.

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,390
He will surely make His Majesty satisfied.

51
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,430
Plus,

52
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,029
he relies on you so much right now.

53
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,300
He follows all your instructions.

54
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,110
But what about Prince Yi?

55
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,990
Dilatory tactics.

56
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,990
Wait and see.

57
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,110
But...

58
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,830
What if our identities were known?

59
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,790
There is no but.

60
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,430
Don't worry.

61
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,110
In the East Mansion,

62
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,830
only you and I know each other's identities.

63
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,270
If we don't say it,

64
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,230
who would know?

65
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,310
You are absolutely right.

66
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
Father.

67
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,860
This wallet with the Northland totem

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,510
was found on the body of the woman.

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,630
I think,

70
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,550
she must have known that

71
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,740
she couldn't escape the tight encirclement set up by you,

72
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,350
so she committed suicide in fear of the crime.

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,390
Xiu. Yi.

74
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,550
What do you think?

75
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,670
I have fought that courtesan.

76
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,830
With her martial arts,

77
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,270
escaping from East City is easy.

78
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,260
Da identified the murderer with just a wallet,

79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,070
isn't it too hasty?

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,150
Xiu, you don't trust me?

81
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,670
Or you don't trust Father's generals.

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,190
This is just my personal opinion.

83
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,990
Yi, what do you say?

84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,550
Da has his point.

85
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,030
Father.

86
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,150
On the surface of Northland, the wind is calm,

87
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,630
but the undercurrent is actually surging.

88
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,310
The assassination of me this time

89
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,110
should be just to make a profit

90
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,190
from the muddy water.

91
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,750
Northland has crossed the line.

92
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,150
Keep digging.

93
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,430
See if there are still Northland spies

94
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,870
in the city.

95
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,830
Make sure to get all of them.

96
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,070
Da.

97
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,510
You did well in this,

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,830
keep up the momentum.

99
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,510
Thank you, father.

100
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,430
It's my responsibility.

101
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,270
Especially when it comes to
 the safety of my brothers,

102
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,500
I dare not neglect.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,430
Da has grown so much.

104
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,950
Father, since the murderer has been caught,

105
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,790
should the wronged person be found innocent?

106
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,430
The wronged person?

107
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,150
Who?

108
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,550
Si Yan of Linchuan Cliff.

109
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,870
It was for her.

110
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,510
You are finally back.

111
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,990
What are you going to do next?

112
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,710
What else can I do?

113
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,990
I'll try to avoid Qi Yi,

114
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,270
and find another way.

115
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,940
That sounds like a good idea.

116
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,870
Reducing the chance of 
accidental events scheduled by the system.

117
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,910
I just don't get it.

118
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,350
What attributes of me

119
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,310
makes the system think I'm like a killer?

120
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,830
Unruly, willful, unscrupulous,

121
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,350
selfish, arrogant,

122
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,430
defiant.

123
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,070
Stop.

124
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,310
You're starting to recite again.

125
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,950
I am all of that, so?

126
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,220
Anyway, I'll try to avoid

127
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,390
the assassination line.

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,390
But...

129
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,630
What?

130
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,030
I'm afraid,

131
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,870
the system won't make changes

132
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,830
because of your ”smart idea".

133
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,909
After all,

134
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,150
it's just the system.

135
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,550
I'm the player.

136
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,230
Can it eat me alive?

137
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,190
And the final task given to me by the system

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,909
is to be the Head Matron.

139
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,750
If I get down to it,

140
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,790
can it keep me in the game?

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,730
What a mess!

142
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,210
Sooner or later I have to do something about

143
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,360
these disgusting behaviors in the mansion!

144
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,610
Don't be so mad, Your Majesty.

145
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
It's all just a joke

146
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,160
among the girls.

147
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,680
Don't take it seriously.

148
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,320
I didn't take it seriously.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
But once these things spread out,

150
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,490
they can also be said to be true.

151
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,440
I will be ashamed!

152
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,570
Xiu.

153
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,890
He idles around all day

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
and doesn't do his job.

155
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
All he does was play around

156
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
with that guard.

157
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,930
Otherwise, why would there be such gossip?

158
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,880
Xiu is still young.

159
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,490
We can teach him right.

160
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,800
Young?

161
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
When I was his age,

162
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,080
I already had two sons!

163
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,360
In my opinion,

164
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,000
if Xiu's marriage is decided,

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,770
all these messes

166
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,800
would have been self-defeating.

167
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
The bottom line,

168
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,450
I'll announce to search for a wife for him

169
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
in the whole East City.

170
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,160
I heard from Xiu

171
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,320
about what happened in Linchuan Cliff.

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm so sorry you had to suffer.

173
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,760
Prince Yi, thanks for your concern.

174
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,570
There is no right or wrong.

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,760
I just want to do my job as a maid well.

176
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Besides, the accidental rescue of the miners

177
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,560
is considered a success.

178
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,170
Si Yan.

179
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,400
Yi.

180
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,240
My lady.

181
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,400
You haven't healed yet.

182
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
You should rest more.

183
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,800
What are you doing here?

184
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,400
Thanks for your caring, mother.

185
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm fine.

186
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,800
I just want to walk around and have some fresh air.

187
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,520
Good timing.

188
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Come with me to the Peace Pavilion.

189
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,960
I heard that a few days ago,

190
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,800
Rui wanted to admire paintings with you,

191
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,770
but you kept saying that you were busy.

192
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,640
Can we go to the Peace Pavilion another day? I...

193
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,210
You don't want to go? Fine.

194
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,810
Just keep her kneeling here.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,320
Yes.

196
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,090
I'll go now.

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Working in the mansion,

198
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
it's better to put away the thoughts

199
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,200
that shouldn't be there.

200
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,360
Kneel for another hour.

201
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Memorize the rules of the mansion.

202
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Yes.

203
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,640
The fall hunt is coming soon.

204
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,120
There's been a lot of trouble

205
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
in this mansion lately.

206
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,720
Tell the maids at the Palace Makeup Service

207
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,690
to behave themselves.

208
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't bring any more trouble.

209
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,400
My lady.

210
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,210
Si Yan has returned to the Palace Makeup Service.

211
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,120
What are you going to do?

212
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,760
Since I can't get rid of her,

213
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,240
then I should make her disappear.

214
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.

215
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,200
If Prince Yi finds out,

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,440
it will ruin your relationship.

217
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
What do you say I should do?

218
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Are you saying...

219
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,370
Are you saying I should let Yi marry her?

220
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
Yes, my lady.

221
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,440
My lady.

222
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
I mean,

223
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,160
why not make use of this opportunity?

224
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,210
Don't you have a trump card

225
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,520
in your hand?

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,210
Yeah.

227
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
I still have Xiu.

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,640
Your Highness,

229
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,160
what were you thinking?

230
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
Luna and Qing Yan.

231
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,930
Why are they so similar?

232
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,850
Look at the eyes,

233
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,640
it's like one person.

234
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,280
Your Highness,

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
one is the courtesan.

236
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
The other is a servant.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
How could they be the same person?

238
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,240
Father, it's better to cancel the fall hunt this year.

239
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,880
The Northland assassination failed last time.

240
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
I'm worried they'll make a comeback.

241
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,320
and endanger your safety.

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Father, the fall hunt is an annual event.

243
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,520
If it was canceled because of a few assassins,

244
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
wouldn't it be like telling the Northland

245
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,120
that East City is afraid them?

246
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,760
Da is right.

247
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,290
A few thieves

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,720
won't get in the way.

249
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,800
This year, the fall hunt is going on as usual.

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,170
Yes.

251
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,640
Yes.

252
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes.

253
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
In previous years, the fall hunt was run by Yi.

254
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,960
But Yi's not healed yet.

255
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,920
This year,

256
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,680
let me run the fall hunt.

257
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,570
Wait.

258
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,840
Where is Xiu?

259
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Prince Xiu, you're so bad.

260
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
You didn't go easy on us at all.

261
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,040
How mean!

262
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,440
Can't I touch you as I want?

263
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,120
Come to me.

264
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,090
Don't laugh at me.

265
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,480
Your Highness, it's time to work.

266
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,850
I gotta go.

267
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,880
Your Highness!

268
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm late.

269
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Settle how much I won.

270
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,680
I'll count on you.

271
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,760
Guard Yun.

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,560
We need you.

273
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,600
We'll win back what we lost today.

274
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,410
Father, morning.

275
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,560
Xiu, you smell of rouge.

276
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
Did you stay at Cloud Brothel again?

277
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,650
Brother Da knew it as soon as he smelled it.

278
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,600
He must be quite familiar with Cloud Brothel too!

279
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,360
Nonsense!

280
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,040
Enough.

281
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,040
Stop the absurdness.

282
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,850
Where were we?

283
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,720
Who's gonna run the fall hunt this year.

284
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,280
He.

285
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,640
Me?

286
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,720
Yes, you.

287
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
Are you serious?

288
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,930
Are you sure you don't want Yi to do it?

289
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
You are gonna run it.

290
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,050
If you do well, I will reward you.

291
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,440
What if I don't?

292
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
You'll have "rewards" either way.

293
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,040
Headache.

294
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,080
Are you having a hangover?

295
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
Or is it because of father?

296
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,370
It's different!

297
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,800
The former is a happy headache.

298
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,370
I'd love it.

299
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,920
The latter is our father's trap

300
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,730
set for me.

301
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,600
It makes me miserable!

302
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,850
Have you got what I need?

303
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Hold on.

304
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Why didn't you tell Si Yan

305
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,520
that it was you that asked me

306
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,170
to protect her in secret at Linchuan Cliff?

307
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
We haven't found the assassin yet.

308
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,880
Mother still suspects her.

309
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
She's sent Si Yan to Linchuan Cliff once,

310
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,320
and she might do it again.

311
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't want Si Yan to be in danger again.

312
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,480
So, you do love her.

313
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,320
I gotta go.

314
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,610
I helped you

315
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,600
protect Si Yan.

316
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
You should help me with the fall hunt.

317
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,960
Father surely knows how to force people.

318
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,280
Brother Xiu, it has to be you.

319
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,840
Way to kick down the ladder!

320
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,359
Prince Xiu is looking for a wife.

321
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,810
There are no limitations.

322
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,200
My daughter is of the proper age.

323
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,490
If Prince Xiu marries my daughter,

324
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,800
I'd wake up laughing!

325
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll take the poster!

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,930
Back off, guys!

327
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,920
Our daughter cannot marry Prince Xiu!

328
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,680
You can't do that to our daughter!

329
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Why not?

330
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,040
Don't you know?

331
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,080
It's rare for a prince to hold a contest
 to choose a wife.

332
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
There must be something strange going on.

333
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,280
Something bigger must be hiding behind all this.

334
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,880
The whole thing is strange

335
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,760
because Prince Xiu suffers from aphallia.

336
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,530
Aphallia?

337
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
It means he can't be intimate with women.

338
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,290
Prince Xiu looks so handsome.

339
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't expect him to be disabled.

340
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,890
What a shame!

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
It should be a shame

342
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,930
for whoever is marrying him.

343
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,520
Your Highness, are you angry

344
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,000
because His Majesty didn't ask you
 to host the fall hunt?

345
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
I think he did it on purpose.

346
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,490
He knew I want to do that,

347
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
so he refused to let me have it.

348
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,240
Da, pace yourself.

349
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,800
You've been working hard to find the assassin.

350
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,050
His Majesty must've seen your effort.

351
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,040
Hosting the fall hunt

352
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,280
is a thankless task.

353
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Maybe it's for the best.

354
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,690
If you can win the fall hunt

355
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,080
and claim the best game,

356
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,200
all eyes will be on you.

357
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,280
When you put it like that,

358
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,680
I feel much better now.

359
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,000
However, there have been a lot of rumors

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
about Prince Xiu.

361
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,050
What?

362
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Do you also find the so-called "aphallia" funny?

363
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,000
Da, you got me wrong.

364
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,890
Those shallow people only judge our appearances

365
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,410
but never see our struggles.

366
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,240
I am in the same situation as Brother Xiu.

367
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,360
What's your story, Your Highness?

368
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,050
My lady.

369
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,960
Lady Qian.

370
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,720
You used to play tricks to get ahead
 when you were a maid.

371
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,970
What are you trying to do, bringing your son

372
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,920
to the garden all the time?

373
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,200
Are you trying to put up a show?

374
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,840
You're born lowly.

375
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
Don't you know your place at all?

376
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,200
Get lost!

377
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Out of my way!

378
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,400
What are you doing?

379
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,410
You brat!

380
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,090
Trying to be rebellious?

381
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,040
My lady!

382
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,090
My lady!

383
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,000
My lady,

384
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,720
it was our fault.

385
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,400
Apologize to Lady Qian right now!

386
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,040
Mother, stop drinking.

387
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,800
Mother, stop!

388
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,160
Leave me alone!

389
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,240
I'm sorry, my son!

390
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,160
I am sorry!

391
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,360
I am sorry!

392
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,840
Have some more.

393
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,040
Than...Than...Thank you, mother.

394
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
Don't stutter!

395
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,330
If others heard that,

396
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,120
they'd speak ill of you.

397
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,690
Ye...Ye...Yes.

398
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,400
I told you not to stutter!

399
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,650
You must find it funny, right?

400
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,640
I am the eldest prince in the East City!

401
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
I am fearless!

402
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,410
Yet, I can't even

403
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,600
finish a whole sentence before a woman.

404
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,690
Your Highness, don't blame yourself.

405
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
It's not a big deal.

406
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,080
It wouldn't be a big deal

407
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
if it happened to an ordinary family.

408
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,640
But it happened to me.

409
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,730
So, it became a sin.

410
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,800
Not only Miss Min will make fun of me,

411
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
but my father will also be

412
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,040
utterly disappointed in me if he finds out.

413
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,080
Do not beat yourself up!

414
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
You're so competent

415
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,640
that you'll be noticed sooner or later.

416
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,120
It's easier said than done.

417
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,570
Opportunity,

418
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,640
luck,

419
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,000
background...

420
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,880
They all matter.

421
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,650
Sometimes, having competence is not enough.

422
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,170
Even if I had all those elements,

423
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,400
still, I may not be able to earn
 my father's recognition.

424
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,760
Miss Si,

425
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,520
due to the counterfeits,

426
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,240
the sales this month...

427
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I'll say it one more time.

428
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,200
I've never sold counterfeits in live-streaming.

429
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,960
Sorry, Miss Si.

430
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
I misspoke.

431
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,160
If I see one more piece of

432
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,120
negative news about me,

433
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,040
I'll fire you for good.

434
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,280
Is this the business you talked about?

435
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,530
Yes.

436
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,080
At least I can be independent right now.

437
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,960
I don't need to take up your time

438
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,800
or use your money.

439
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,130
You call it being independent

440
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,480
by working for someone like a maid?

441
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,680
Well, enough about me.

442
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,730
You won't understand.

443
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,120
How could I not understand?

444
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,640
I heard that Lady Cui

445
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,280
will bring court ladies
 from the Procurement Department.

446
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,040
Are they here to recruit new maids
 for procurement?

447
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,280
It's a job with great benefits.

448
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,240
You can make a lot of money.

449
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,440
Many girls are fighting intensely
 for that position.

450
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,570
Is everyone here?

451
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,280
Yes.

452
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,920
The maids from the Manufacturing Dept.,
 Research Dept.,

453
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,320
and the Warehouse are all here.

454
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,160
The annual fall hunt is approaching.

455
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,080
We shall all work hard

456
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,040
to design the most gorgeous looks for the ladies.

457
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,720
Meanwhile, we need to cooperate with

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,240
the Garment Service and the Jewelry Service

459
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,160
to provide the best service for the masters.

460
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Yes.

461
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,880
Although it's already early autumn,

462
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,560
the summer heat is not gone yet.

463
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,480
The makeup should be lightweight and breathable.

464
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,960
Also, sunblock is crucial.

465
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,080
Sunblock?

466
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,400
They've already known such an advanced concept!

467
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,920
The Makeup Service will be in charge of makeup.

468
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,920
We've got all the cosmetics.

469
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,570
We only need to buy sun-blocking veil hats
 for the masters.

470
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,520
I will choose one of you as the court lady

471
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
for procurement.

472
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,280
She'll be in charge of the hats.

473
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,040
You can ask her if you have any questions.

474
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,520
Yes.

475
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,090
Who wants to be in charge of the hats?

476
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,880
If you want to do that,

477
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,920
you should be good with numbers.

478
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,970
This is the bill for the procurement
 of cosmetics last year.

479
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,040
You've got fifteen minutes.

480
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
The one to work it out first

481
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,120
will be in charge of the procurement.

482
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Don't you know how to use the abacus?

483
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,320
I don't need it.

484
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,680
The total is

485
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,280
3,453 tael, 7 maces, and 3 candareens.

486
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,090
How come she calculated it so fast?

487
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm not even halfway done.

488
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,170
All correct!

489
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,840
You're a beauty blogger who's been

490
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
reading financial reports for years

491
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,360
and using big data for business negotiation.

492
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,200
It's a piece of cake for you
to mentally calculate the numbers.

493
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,650
Turns out you do know me well.

494
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,240
When you get on with the procurement,

495
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,320
be smart

496
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,560
and don't get ripped off.

497
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,240
Madam,

498
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,800
I think you've got it the other way around.

499
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,690
I will try not to rip off others.

500
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:57,810
Madam.

501
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,200
Your Highness.

502
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,040
I need Si Yan for a sec.

503
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,490
Your Highness,

504
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,300
I am busy.

505
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,720
You dragged me here without telling me why.

506
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,840
It's against the rules.

507
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
Since when do you care about the rules?

508
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,930
I've always been following the rules

509
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,800
and dare not break them.

510
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,450
If there's nothing else,

511
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,360
I need to go now

512
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,010
in case of any misunderstandings.

513
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,240
What?

514
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,320
I need to ask you about this.

515
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,480
I see.

516
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,680
This person does look familiar, though.

517
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,080
Do you think I am pretty?

518
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,160
What about now?

519
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,050
Luna?

520
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
Are you sure this is Luna in the portrait?

521
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,210
It looked like her at first glance.

522
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,320
But

523
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,640
half of Luna's face is covered with a burn scar.

524
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,840
She did paint a colorful pattern over it,

525
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,960
but it still is very obvious.

526
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,490
What pattern?

527
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,530
Floral?

528
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,200
Floral?

529
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,010
Draw the pattern here and match the size

530
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,320
and location of that on Luna's face.

531
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,680
How come a maid in the Makeup Service

532
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,600
not know how to draw?

533
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,290
You're even holding the pen wrong.

534
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,720
What flower is it that you're drawing?

535
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,320
A dandelion.

536
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,080
You are better at this indeed.

537
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,960
Si Yan,

538
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,010
why have you always been avoiding me lately?

539
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,850
I have to do something.

540
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,640
I gotta go.

541
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,210
Calligraphy sounds complicated,

542
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,490
but it's not so hard to actually do it.

543
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,240
That looks great.

544
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,240
The strokes are elegant and subtle,

545
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
and yet magnificent.

546
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,920
It's as light as clouds

547
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,640
and as powerful as the dragon.

548
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,250
It resembles the style of Wang Youjun.

549
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,240
Wang Youjun?

550
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,800
Even Wang Xizhi will applaud me

551
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,000
if he sees my writing.

552
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Wang Youjun is Wang Xizhi.

553
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
They are the same person.

554
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,480
Good for you!

555
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,600
You've learned to make fun of me, huh?

556
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,400
Si Yan, you're here, too.

557
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,640
What brings you here?

558
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm here to get some bath beads for the Second Lady.

559
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,450
Are you practicing calligraphy?

560
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,000
What are you writing?

561
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,040
It's not finished yet.

562
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,930
Qi?

563
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Will the next word

564
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,440
be Yi

565
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,010
or Xiu?

566
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,810
Neither.

567
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,880
I'll go for "Bae."

568
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,640
What's wrong?

569
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,080
This morning, I saw Prince Bao

570
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,520
greeting the Second Lady.

571
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,360
He looked frail.

572
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,770
I heard from Xiao Bao that

573
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,450
he hasn't been eating for days.

574
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
Can you talk some sense into him?

575
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,360
I'm not gonna do that.

576
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,080
Why not?

577
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,690
He's become like this because of you.

578
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
Go talk to him.

579
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,680
Consider it a favor for me.

580
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,000
It's not that I don't want to do it.

581
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,320
It's that I can't.

582
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,480
If I like him, I'll admit it.

583
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
If I don't like him, I can't leave him hanging.

584
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,000
If I go and talk to him,

585
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,600
he'll become hopeful all over again.

586
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,680
It's better to kill that hope once and for all.

587
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,360
It's beneath me

588
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,050
to keep a backup boyfriend.

589
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,520
Backup?

590
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,520
Why can't I understand

591
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,690
any of the things you said?

592
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,010
I only know that if you talk to him,

593
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,560
he'll be less upset.

594
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,330
Do you still care about him that much?

595
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,850
I don't.

596
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,130
If you want him to get better sooner,

597
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,720
spend some time with him.

598
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,560
Ask him to take care of the pet hamsters

599
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
as a distraction.

600
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,760
Make him forget me.

601
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,520
I'll leave this important task to you.

602
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,000
You can do it!

603
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,400
Go on!

604
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,320
You poor thing,

605
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,080
Little Wan is ignoring you, huh?

606
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,490
I know how you feel.

607
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,520
You can't eat well

608
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,210
or sleep well.

609
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,920
All you can think about is her.

610
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,250
But at least,

611
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,920
you two are still together.

612
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,440
You are the only ones that I can talk to.

613
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,960
You're hungry, right?

614
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,320
Sorry,

615
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,640
I've been neglecting you lately.

616
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,770
Wait for me.

617
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,850
Here you are, my friends!

618
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,889
Have some snacks.

619
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,719
What's wrong?

620
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,360
Little Wan's clothes...

621
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,440
I am in such bad luck today.

622
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,690
Prince Xiu,

623
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,770
I heard that you're looking for a wife.

624
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,679
Who did you take a fancy to?

625
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,520
What do you think of me?

626
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,159
You? You're too much for me.

627
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,960
Your Highness,

628
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,040
pick me!

629
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,000
I will make sure to put up an act for you.

630
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,360
We can be lovey-dovey in the day,
 and live separate lives at night.

631
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,199
What do you say?

632
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,639
That's a good idea!

633
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,000
Your Highness.

634
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,520
You wrote such nice stories.

635
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I love the stories you've been telling these days.

636
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,160
But they are not thrilling

637
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,360
or twisted enough.

638
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,240
You can add more drama to them.

639
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,520
More drama?

640
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay.

641
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,600
I understand, Your Highness.

642
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,160
Your Highness, don't go!

643
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,480
You won all this money from us.

644
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,920
We need to win it back!

645
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,320
One more round!

646
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,090
No problem!

647
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,370
Why do you pretend

648
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,640
that you suffer from aphallia?

649
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,170
I just think that

650
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,930
you're making His Majesty angry on purpose.

651
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,650
If I didn't say that,

652
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,810
I'd be rushed to build a family and pursue a career.

653
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,170
But I don't understand

654
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,050
why people have to build families

655
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,290
or pursue careers?

656
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,090
But that's what most people do.

657
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,730
I am not most people.

658
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,850
I only want to live a carefree life.

659
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,420
Let's go.

660
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,210
I haven't found the rosewood powder box.

661
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,850
Where on earth is it?

662
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,770
Luckily, I have the Prunus mume

663
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,370
recovery serum.

664
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,730
I've got fewer breakouts and pimples now.

665
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,690
Jack, what's happening?

666
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,450
The rosewood powder box

667
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,490
was there on the carriage

668
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,880
when I had my first exam.

669
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,010
Seems that the powder box is a tool

670
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,570
to connect with the world outside the game.

671
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,330
I think this letter is from your father.

672
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,970
I've been in the game for so long.

673
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,290
That stubborn old man

674
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,960
surely waited long enough to contact me.

675
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Where has he been?

676
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,290
Perhaps it's a new feature after the system upgrade.

677
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,610
Don't you want to read it?

678
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,920
Why bother?

679
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,970
I can guess what he wrote.

680
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,970
Why would I upset myself?

681
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,120
Maybe

682
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,930
your father is worried about you.

683
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,880
How about this?

684
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,930
I'll read it to you.

685
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,410
Dear Rui, my daughter, how are you?

686
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,810
I miss you very much.

687
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,930
I can't hold on anymore.

688
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,450
I hope you can finish your tasks and come back soon.

689
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,680
Best wishes, Tong Hui?

690
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,970
Rui?

691
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,450
Who's Rui?

692
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,810
Nobody.

693
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,160
I want to go to bed now.

694
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,210
I need to buy veil hats tomorrow.

695
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,010
Go back to the system.

696
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,410
Think of a pose, everyone!

697
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,480
Let's take a photo.

698
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,450
Three, two, one!

699
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,370
Cheese!

700
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,050
Glasses!

701
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,610
Three minutes to go.

702
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,650
Can we change the makeup?

703
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,360
Yes.

704
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,690
In terms of the concealer,

705
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,120
you just pat it on your face gently.

706
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,200
If I see one more piece

707
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,130
of negative news about me,

708
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,730
I'll fire you for good.

709
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,010
I'll do my best.

710
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,810
You call it being independent

711
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,170
by working for someone like a maid?

712
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,730
Go home with me.

713
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,890
I need you, my daughter.

714
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,960
You only need your job

715
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,530
and your programs.

716
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,010
Have you ever cared about me?
