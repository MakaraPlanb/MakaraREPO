1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,470
Your Highness,

3
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,190
the Royal Army is ready.

4
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,270
We can set off anytime.

5
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,950
Wait for a bit longer.

6
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,790
Yes.

7
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,829
Your Highness, it's morning now.

8
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,630
Shall we leave?

9
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,150
Give me another minute.

10
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,550
Whom is His Highness waiting for?

11
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,380
It has been four hours already.

12
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,790
His Highness must be

13
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,590
waiting for his lover.

14
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,380
That makes sense.

15
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,829
No one knows how long it takes

16
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,380
before he can come back and see her again.

17
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,829
It's worth waiting.

18
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,110
I wonder

19
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,590
what this girl looks like.

20
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,180
Let's go!

21
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,390
Yi, what are you thinking?

22
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,470
I'm thinking of Teng.

23
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,430
Teng,

24
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,790
we will break through the Redbud Pass

25
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,110
and destroy the Northland's army this time.

26
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,950
Yi,

27
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,070
there are no winners on the battlefield.

28
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,590
Because whoever wins

29
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,990
also pays a terrible price.

30
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,270
As the crowned prince,

31
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,350
I want to make sure
the world is free of war

32
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,380
and all people can live in peace.

33
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,630
Cheers!

34
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,190
Cheers!

35
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,060
I overestimated the Northland's army.

36
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,830
They were so easily defeated

37
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,710
and had to retreat.

38
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,830
Should we attack the Redbud Pass tomorrow

39
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,470
while our morale is still high

40
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,110
and get them out of the Pass once for all?

41
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,590
Da,

42
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,460
the Redbud Pass is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

43
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,830
I'm afraid that things can't be this easy.

44
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,909
I've already sent scouts to the Pass.

45
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,750
Shall we wait for a few more days?

46
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,110
We can make our plan

47
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,909
after army provisions led by Xiu arrive.

48
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,470
Yi, you're being overly cautious.

49
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,430
The Northland's army suffered heavy losses

50
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,510
and had to run back to the Pass.

51
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,670
If we don't start the attack soon,

52
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,390
are we giving them time to recover?

53
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,030
I know you want to win,

54
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,830
but we can't make a move
without careful thought.

55
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,590
The Redbud Pass is full of secret passages.

56
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,350
It's extremely dangerous.

57
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,830
Even Teng...

58
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,750
I'm not Teng!

59
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,590
We are in a different situation now.

60
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,750
Yi, don't forget

61
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,940
who the Commander is.

62
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,750
Da...

63
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,909
I agree with the Commander.

64
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,110
We will be running out of food soon.

65
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,390
If we wait any longer,

66
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,030
we'll be giving our enemy time to rest.

67
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,990
If we want to fight,

68
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,070
we need to do it fast.

69
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,710
I don't think so!

70
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,510
All of our soldiers

71
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,870
are suffering from frostbite.

72
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,230
We shouldn't act rashly.

73
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,220
Know yourself as well as your enemy.

74
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,790
We shouldn't make decisions

75
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,750
until the scouts come back

76
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,750
with information about the Pass.

77
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,030
Do you know that speed is everything?

78
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,430
But we can't put our soldiers' lives

79
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,030
at risk!

80
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,590
Enough!

81
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,100
Dismissed.

82
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,950
Yes, Commander.

83
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,310
The shadow of geese reflected in the water
and the plum flowers withered.

84
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,669
There is nothing around
except for the flying snow,

85
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,870
making the night as clear as day.

86
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,950
Si Yan,

87
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,500
are we

88
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,750
looking at the same moon?

89
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,390
Qi Yi went to the front.

90
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,750
Jack got angry and refused to come out.

91
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,590
Even Tong Rui went back to the Min Mansion.

92
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,060
Did she go to the Min Mansion

93
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,830
or did she finish her task
and go back home?

94
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,910
It seems that

95
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,430
I'm the only one left here.

96
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,670
Don't just focus on building your muscle.

97
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,110
You can't work out on an empty stomach.

98
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,550
Have some rest.

99
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,270
I can't.

100
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,870
I won't eat.

101
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,390
I was not strong enough.

102
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,750
That's why His Highness didn't select me.

103
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,510
Or,

104
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,390
I would be in the army
with His Highness

105
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,990
and fight the enemy.

106
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,350
Little Wan!

107
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,220
Help! Mouse!

108
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,990
Where is the mouse?

109
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,070
Help me!

110
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,150
I will protect you!

111
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,950
You will be alright!

112
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,270
Si Yan.

113
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,030
Si Yan!

114
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,270
What are you doing here?

115
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,550
Such a coward!

116
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,550
How can you fight the enemy?

117
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,190
These carbohydrates are not allowed
while building your muscle.

118
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,350
Let me help you with this.

119
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,550
Tangier made this for me.

120
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,750
Give it back.

121
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,670
Si Yan, look what you did.

122
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,380
What's wrong?

123
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,270
It's so...

124
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,830
so delicious.

125
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,070
Aren't you overreacting?

126
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,550
It occurs to me that,

127
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,910
while we are having delicious food here,

128
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,510
the Northland

129
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,900
is cold

130
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,270
and is short of food and clothing.

131
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,710
I wonder if His Highness has enough food

132
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,030
and stays warm.

133
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,190
His hands got serious frostbite

134
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,990
the last time he came back from the Northland.

135
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,260
I wonder if everything goes well with them.

136
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,310
Si Yan,

137
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,190
should we go to the temple some time,

138
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,700
burn the incense,

139
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,430
and pray for all East City's soldiers
to come back safely?

140
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,660
I won't join you.

141
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,430
I don't have these superstitious beliefs.

142
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,030
Does the war in the game
really cause death?

143
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,670
Dear Bodhisattva,

144
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,030
please make sure Qi Yi's safe

145
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,670
and let him come back soon.

146
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,950
Watch out, my lady.

147
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,140
No worries.

148
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,910
I'm fine.

149
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,470
I've been anxious these days.

150
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,430
I feel better

151
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,350
being here.

152
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,150
My lady,

153
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,190
don't worry.

154
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,220
My lady.

155
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,550
Dear Bodhisattva,

156
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,470
I've been fasting and chanting these years.

157
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,350
I only wish for

158
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,430
peace in the world,

159
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,470
but now

160
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,270
the East City is at war again

161
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,510
and Yi went to the Northland.

162
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,310
I don't expect him
to make achievements in war.

163
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,740
I only want him to return safely.

164
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,590
My lady,

165
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,910
didn't His Highness say that

166
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,510
everything is alright in his letter?

167
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,940
Don't worry too much about him.

168
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,270
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

169
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,310
He always reports good news
rather than bad ones.

170
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,790
Did he have frostbite again?

171
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,230
Frostbite?

172
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,430
It breaks my heart when I think of this.

173
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,790
They have doctors there.

174
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,230
Don't worry.

175
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm sure he will take care of himself.

176
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,150
Dear Bodhisattva,

177
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,710
please let my son return safely.

178
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,350
He can do whatever he wants.

179
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,790
He can marry whomever he likes.

180
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,070
Don't waste time on this.

181
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,790
The cream for frostbite

182
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,750
can't be made within one or two days.

183
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,070
Indeed. Do you see how much smoke there is?

184
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,950
Why is it burnt again?

185
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,110
This doesn't make sense.

186
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,310
Si Yan,

187
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,830
you don't even control the heat.

188
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,950
Of course, it was burnt!

189
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,390
Stay away if you don't want to help.

190
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,070
Leave me alone.

191
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,350
You can make jokes about anything,

192
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,180
but this is about the war.

193
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,630
It's about human lives.

194
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,630
We have to take it seriously.

195
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,150
Why are you doing this?

196
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,950
My elder brother is also in the front.

197
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,350
I don't want people
to make jokes about this.

198
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,630
Li,

199
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,710
people from the East City
killed your father.

200
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,390
You must find the heartbreak grass recipe,

201
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,190
throw the East City into chaos,

202
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,630
and revenge for your father.

203
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,190
You're the descendant of the Yun family.

204
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,310
You need to shoulder your responsibility.

205
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,390
Yun Li,

206
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,430
are all provisions loaded?

207
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,950
We're putting extra men on it.

208
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,190
The provisions
are urgently needed this time.

209
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,710
I don't know if we can make it in time.

210
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,140
Use the waterway.

211
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,950
I'm sure we can.

212
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,230
Look at this.

213
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,430
The mountain roads in the Northland
are rugged and full of bandits,

214
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,550
but the river is slow-moving.

215
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,550
We can save a lot of time.

216
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,270
Your Highness, bad news.

217
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,270
The provision boats overturned!

218
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,950
Get the horse ready.

219
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,350
Your Highness.

220
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,430
What happened?

221
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,190
How could the boats

222
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,270
suddenly overturn?

223
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,070
I'm new here.

224
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,870
It was my first time
to escort the provisions.

225
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,470
Yesterday...

226
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,390
Manager Ruan,

227
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,590
there aren't any joiners

228
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,790
to reinforce the boats.

229
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,990
The boats will easily leak.

230
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,510
I asked you to load the provisions.

231
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,630
There's no time for that nonsense!

232
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,100
Move!

233
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,470
My family has been repairing boats
for generations.

234
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,830
That's why I...

235
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,510
Enough!

236
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,190
I think you're just lazy!

237
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,910
Just leave

238
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,750
if you don't want to work!

239
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,310
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,190
If I hadn't given up so easily,

241
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,590
this wouldn't have happened.

242
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,550
Where is Manager Ruan?

243
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,790
I...I have no idea.

244
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,790
Make sure he receives treatment.

245
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,950
Yes.

246
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,270
Your Highness, we're in trouble.

247
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,430
The granary is on fire.

248
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,550
Let's go!

249
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,190
The boats overturned
and the granary was on fire.

250
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,710
We can only get food from other places.

251
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,390
It will take
at least several months to arrive here

252
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,390
with such a great amount of food,

253
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,390
not to mention sending it to the north.

254
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,829
Our soldiers won't make it till that time.

255
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,109
The only solution we have now

256
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,550
is to borrow food from our people.

257
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,069
We can't.

258
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,950
We had several floods these years.

259
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,150
People already had a poor harvest.

260
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,270
We can't give them more burden.

261
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,070
Then what should we do?

262
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,230
You can start with the food

263
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,990
reserved by the noble and the rich.

264
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,060
Dismissed.

265
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,790
Those people are cunning.

267
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,070
How can we persuade them to donate food?

268
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,270
Exactly.

269
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,070
Here's the order from the king.

270
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,750
The war in the Northland is urgent.

271
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,750
Our soldiers are out of provisions.

272
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,470
The nobles and wealthy merchants
are hereby ordered to donate food

273
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,870
and set an example for everyone.

274
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,230
Everyone is encouraged
to show their support to our army.

275
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,190
Ms. Qin arrives!

276
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,070
Ms. Min arrives!

277
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,950
This way.

278
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,110
The wife of the minister arrives!

279
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,390
I'm sure that

280
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,070
all the beautiful ladies here,

281
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,420
including sisters, aunties, and grannies,

282
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,190
are quite wealthy.

283
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,150
However,

284
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,060
no money is needed today.

285
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,070
We only want food.

286
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,070
Food?

287
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,430
If you don't have a food reserve
in your house,

288
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,670
I'm afraid you won't be able to join

289
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,190
this charity auction.

290
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,430
This is the time

291
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,910
to show your connections and abilities.

292
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,180
Please encourage people you know

293
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,870
to help and to support

294
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,430
our soldiers

295
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,270
who fight in the front!

296
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,630
Agreed!

297
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,150
The East Mansion
collaborated with Forever Young

298
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,190
and made this VIP makeup set.

299
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,460
They were customized to your skin type.

300
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,870
It has everything you need,

301
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,950
from skincare products

302
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,310
to makeup products.

303
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,910
I'm sure you will look ten years younger

304
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,110
after using them.

305
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,790
Wait, I'm wrong.

306
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,110
You will look like you're eighteen!

307
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,510
We only have a limited number of products.

308
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,870
Only the most important people
can have them.

309
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,630
There are only ten of these.

310
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,150
Ten!

311
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,630
People with a higher price take them home.

312
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,390
Only ten?

313
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,950
We have to bid for them?

314
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,790
I also invited a special guest here

315
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,470
to show you our products.

316
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,670
Let's give him a round of applause!

317
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,030
Great!

318
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,350
Prince Bao! He is so handsome!

319
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,390
Prince Bao!

320
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,750
Easy.

321
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,110
Just do what I taught you.

322
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,030
You can do this.

323
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,350
Si Yan,

324
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,510
I don't think I can.

325
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,310
Why?

326
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,270
Even if you don't trust yourself,

327
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,310
you have to trust a beauty blogger.

328
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,270
Who?

329
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,950
Never mind. Let's get started.

330
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,670
Hurry.

331
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,750
Oh my god!

332
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,590
Girls, here we go!

333
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,460
This is the Palace Makeup Service‘s
limited edition product,

334
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,910
joined colors floral blush.

335
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,470
There are five different colors.

336
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,550
Five colors!

337
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,910
Look at this color.

338
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,390
If you wear this,

339
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,070
your cheek will be
as pink as a juicy peach.

340
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
What are you waiting for?

341
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,470
Buy it!

342
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,230

Congratulations!

355
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,430
Congratulations!

356
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,990
It's getting more and more competitive now.

357
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,070
This is the Beauty of Moment shadow palette.

358
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,630
1,400 lbs of grain to start!

359
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,070
Only 1,400?

360
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,990
Oh No!

361
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
You...you...

362
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,230
you missed a zero.

363
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,990
I missed a zero?

364
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,190
That's fine.

365
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,150
I already said 1,400.

366
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,310
1,400 it is then.

367
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,700
We can't do 1,400.

368
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,510
It's too cheap.

369
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,950
We'll be at a great loss.

370
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,510
Your Highness,

371
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,390
they are my important guests.

372
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,500
Can you do me a favor

373
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,590
and start with 1,400?

374
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,670
What do you say?

375
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,830
She's right!

376
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,100
Yes.

377
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,420
1,400 is not possible.

378
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,630
I can sell one or two sets at this price,

379
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,580
but they want fifty of this.

380
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,350
Fifty?

381
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,270
Such a great amount!

382
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,740
I can't imagine how much money we will lose.

383
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,990
No, I can't do this.

384
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,950
Don't be so stingy.

385
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,910
Why are we making these makeup products?

386
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,990
On a narrow scale,

387
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,790
we want our guests to be happy.

388
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,980
But on a larger scale,

389
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,430
it shows the Makeup Service's support

390
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,470
to soldiers who protect our country.

391
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,590
Am I right?

392
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,830
Yes.

393
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,030
I already said 1,400.

394
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,150
1,400 it is then!

395
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,750
Let's start the bid.

396
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,310
I want ten sets.

397
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,310
Twenty!

398
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,190
I'll take all of them.

399
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,910
How can you buy all of them?

400
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,230
There are so many left.
How dare you buy them all?

401
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,430
Calm down, everyone.

402
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,110
I can assure you that
you'll get as many as you want.

403
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,430
I want it as well.

404
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,350
Me too!

405
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,350
Count me in!

406
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,830
Me too!

407
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,670
Your Highness.

408
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,670
Any news?

409
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,030
It's hard to locate the sinking boats.

410
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,190
We didn't find the provisions.

411
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,220
Any news from the East Mansion?

412
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,390
How can they get enough food

413
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,870
within such a little amount of time?

414
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,670
If we don't do anything,

415
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,750
I'm afraid that

416
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,180
soldiers in the front
won't survive any longer.

417
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,950
Your Highness, look!

418
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,540
We've got provisions!

419
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,990
Si Yan.

420
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,300
You killed our wolf god.

421
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,820
We will offer you as a sacrifice

422
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,630
to the wolf god

423
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,910
for success against the East City!

424
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,910
Sacrifice!

425
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,870
Sacrifice!

426
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,790
Sacrifice!

427
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,100
Our army is bearing down upon the border.

428
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,750
Even the wolf god can't save you.

429
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,710
Let me go!

430
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,750
I can ask the East City's army to retreat!

431
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,870
Today,

432
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,750
you will be the human sacrifice
for the wolf god!

433
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,270
Wait!

434
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,110
My lady,

435
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,710
you can't go to the Northland alone.

436
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,300
I've heard that

437
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,420
the King of the Northland keeps a leading wolf.

438
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,910
It is all white

439
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,990
and very smart.

440
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,430
I wonder

441
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,990
if it's true.

442
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,990
I've heard that

443
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,710
there is a mythical beast in the Northland,

444
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,150
a leading wolf.

445
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,420
What?

446
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,510
Do you want to see it?

447
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,110
You?

448
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,910
I can't,

449
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,030
but I know a man who can.

450
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,110
Who?

451
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,590
Your Majesty, this woman is very cunning.

452
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,870
We can't trust her.

453
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,830
I'm telling you the truth!

454
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,590
All we do is wait.

455
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,750
How long should we wait?

456
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,990
Where is Prince Yi?

457
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,230
He left early this morning.

458
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,630
Your Highness.

459
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,180
Where is Yi?

460
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,820
He is the Vice Commander.

461
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,550
How could he leave at this critical moment?

462
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,390
Please calm down, Commander.

463
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,710
The scouts we sent to the Pass

464
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,830
all disappeared.

465
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,030
The Vice Commander thought
there might be traps.

466
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,910
So he took some people to the Pass.

467
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,750
He especially mentioned that

468
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,510
we should stay put

469
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,150
until he comes back.

470
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,740
How can you
let the Vice Commander eat this?

471
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,190
He asked to eat the soldier's meal himself.

472
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,990
Whoever lies to him

473
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,990
will be punished.

474
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,550
We received a letter!

475
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,310
Where is it from?

476
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,670
The envoy from the Northland sent this.

477
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,910
They're struggling for nothing.

478
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,790
What tricks are they playing?

479
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,190
From this moment,

480
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,870
I'm yours.

481
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,950
This token represents me.

482
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,790
We'll never be apart anymore.

483
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,550
Does this token look familiar to you?

484
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,910
Come to the Blackwater Valley
if you want to see her.

485
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,870
Get the horse ready.

486
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,430
Yes.

487
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,950
Split up!

488
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,830
Figure out how they deploy their troops

489
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,180
and meet at the gate after midnight.

490
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,870
Brother,

491
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,350
do you think the heavenly army's legend
in the Pass is true?

492
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,470
The Northland's Commander Wei Xuan

493
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,470
just succeeded to the throne.

494
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,910
Although the city
has been in lockdown for seven days,

495
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,580
they are still able to fight

496
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,470
and they have continuous food
and human supply

497
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,350
delivered here.

498
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,350
I think there should be a secret passage

499
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,750
to the Northland's military camps.

500
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,190
Let's split up and search for it.

501
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,110
Meet here

502
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,030
four hours later.

503
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,710
Scouts! Keep them alive!

504
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,190
Yi,

505
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,150
I found the secret passage!

506
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,710
It's under the water prison at the gate.

507
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,590
We don't have time for it today.

508
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,300
Let's get out first!

509
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,990
Catch them!

510
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,630
We need to get into the water prison.

511
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,350
Don't you really believe that

512
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,310
a token is enough

513
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,790
for the Prince Da

514
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,470
to risk his life for me?

515
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,750
Don't be stupid.

516
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,830
That's not possible.

517
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,670
That's the prince token.

518
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,350
You're really important to him.

519
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,980
You should wish that he will come here.

520
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,230
If he won't come here,

521
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,910
I will feed those wolves with you.

522
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,510
However,

523
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,830
if he does risk his life for a woman,

524
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,710
I will look down on him.

525
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,430
Commander, this is clearly a trap.

526
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,340
You shouldn't go here.

527
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,110
Since no one comes here to save you,

528
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,270
you're useless to us now.

529
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,830
Take her to the wolves

530
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,150
and feed them.

531
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,910
Commander!

532
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,950
I have to go there.

533
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,670
This is the order.

534
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,270
Wait.

535
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,510
Let her go! I'm here!

536
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,190
Wait!

537
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,950
Let her go! I'm here!

538
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,510
Qi Da!

539
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,830
Tell the Commander

540
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,060
that we already had enough information.

541
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,230
Send the troops as soon as possible.

542
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,630
Yes.

543
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,310
Did we receive news from the East City?

544
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,870
Cream for frostbite.

545
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,500
Give this to the doctors

546
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,270
and ask them to make the same set.

547
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,670
Yes.

548
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,180
I think of you.

549
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,790
I miss you.

550
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,420
I love you.

551
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,910
So mushy.

552
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,470
If he doesn't see this, then that's it!

553
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,590
Your Highness!

554
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,949
Your Highness, bad news!

555
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,949
The Northland
sent us a letter of surrender.

556
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,830
They...

557
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,150
they caught the Commander.

558
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,510
Who do they think they are?

559
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,870
The East City's Commander

560
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,219
was easily caught by me.

561
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,030
Let's drink!

562
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,710
Your Majesty, you're wise!

563
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,830
You didn't keep your promise!

564
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,390
You promised to let me go,

565
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,150
but you prisoned me again.

566
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,070
Why did you do this?

567
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,230
Let her go then.

568
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,030
We have Qi Da in our hands.

569
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,550
I guess she won't just run away.

570
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,110
Am I right?

571
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,350
You really helped me this time.

572
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,950
Here's to you!

573
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,550
I will kill Qi Da

574
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,590
to worship the wolf god

575
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,470
after the East City surrenders tomorrow.

576
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,950
We can take our time to catch up then.

577
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,070
You are so

578
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,590
short-sighted.

579
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,190
What do you have to say?

580
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,270
Do you really think that

581
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,830
catching Qi Da will solve everything?

582
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,790
I'm afraid that
it's too early for you to celebrate.

583
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,950
Why?

584
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,390
I didn't finish my words last time.

585
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,430
The man I was talking about

586
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,230
was not Qi Da.

587
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,710
The East City's army has another mainstay.

588
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,750
He is the one
that you should be worried about.

589
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,990
Do you mean Qi Yi?

590
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,630
That's right.

591
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,750
Prince Yi is better in brains and martial arts

592
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,110
compared with Prince Da.

593
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,110
Apart from that,

594
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,070
Prince Yi is the First Lady's son.

595
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,150
Without Prince Da,

596
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,550
it's only a matter of time
before Prince Yi becomes the king.

597
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,830
Several years ago,

598
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,870
you killed Prince Teng

599
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,030
during the fight between the two countries.

600
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,430
Prince Yi will be your greatest threat

601
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,190
if he succeeds to the throne.

602
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,870
I assume that

603
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,350
you don't want to see this happen.

604
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,150
Go on.

605
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,630
Why not let Prince Yi replace Prince Da?

606
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,710
If you have Prince Yi with you,

607
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,510
you can ask as much territory

608
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,790
and war indemnity as you wish.

609
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,230
Also,

610
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,140
Prince Da will appreciate your help.

611
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,110
If he succeeds to the throne,

612
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,790
he won't forget the person who helps him.

613
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,070
The East City and the Northland

614
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,670
can be allies someday.

615
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,070
Two birds with one stone.

616
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,470
You're beating around the bush.

617
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,550
Don't you want me

618
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,270
to focus on Qi Yi

619
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,950
so that you can save your lover?

620
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,270
But you're right

621
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,310
about Qi Yi.

622
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,190
He weighs much more

623
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,710
than a few cities and money.

624
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,550
If I have him,

625
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,030
I can have two discussions
on the compensation.

626
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,990
So you mean...

627
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,710
you're not the only one
who wants to make use of Qi Yi.

628
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,710
I've said that you helped me!

629
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,990
I have to treat you well.

630
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,350
Give her two maids

631
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,550
to take care of her.

632
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,230
Yes.

633
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,910
Thank you.

634
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,550
Your Majesty,

635
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,870
are you going to exchange prisoners

636
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,030
as she said?

637
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,910
What she said is right.

638
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,030
Qi Yi

639
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,910
is the real threat to me.

640
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,900
If he becomes the king,

641
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,950
he won't forgive me
for the things I have done.

642
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,110
Your Majesty,

643
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,870
will Qi Yi come here?

644
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,660
I've heard that

645
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,190
those two are fighting
for the crowned prince's position.

646
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,670
If this is not Qi Yi,

647
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,860
I won't take the risk.

648
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,510
Qi Yi

649
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,030
is like his brother Qi Teng.

650
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,630
They care more about camaraderie
than anything.

651
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,350
Hurry!

652
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,590
Emergency!

653
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,110
Prince Yi is in danger!

654
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,470
Prince Yi?

655
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,950
Did you hear the news?

656
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,630
In order to save Prince Da,

657
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,030
Prince Yi agreed to be
the Northland's prisoner.

658
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,190
Qi Yi will die.

659
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,590
You can't change this.

660
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,230
What kind of characters

661
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,030
can't even survive the second level?

662
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,950
Like bosses in the basic levels,

663
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,390
Miss Si Yan.

664
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,870
Also, monsters in those role-play games.

665
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,590
I have to find ways to save Qi Yi.

666
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,310
Luna, come out.

667
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,590
I know you're secretly watching me.

668
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,940
Come out!

669
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,910
The stupid game is crashed.

670
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,030
I can't go to the Northland.

671
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,870
What is this place?

672
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,030
I need to restart the system

673
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,950
and unlock the rest of the map.

674
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,430
If the master hadn't asked me
to keep you alive,

675
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,150
I would have killed you,

676
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,350
an idiot who failed the task several times.

677
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,510
Tell me,

678
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,390
why do you want to meet me here?

679
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,870
It's hard to take action
when the East City's filled with people.

680
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,270
I could only win Qi Yi's trust first.

681
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,830
This is a precious opportunity.

682
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,630
I will kill Qi YI in the Northland

683
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,230
without raising any attention

684
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,220
to show my loyalty.

685
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,670
Please give me another chance.

686
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,830
Isn't this game too intelligent?

687
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,430
Everything is back to normal

688
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,670
once I said I would kill Qi Yi.

689
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,750
Problems will be solved in the end.

690
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,710
I need to see Qi Yi first.
