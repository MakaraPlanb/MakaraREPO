1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,110
Provisions are coming!

3
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,350
Provisions are coming!

4
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,910
Prince Da.

5
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,590
The provisions have arrived.

6
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,270
I got it.

7
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,510
You can leave now.

8
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,750
Yes.

9
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,070
It's all because of the information
from Princess Hua Yan.

10
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,110
Interrogate these foreign merchants.

11
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,510
I'd like to see

12
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,110
who is smuggling provisions
and committing treason.

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,350
Yes.

14
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,870
With provisions,

15
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,550
we have to rescue Yi as soon as possible.

16
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,910
Master.

17
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,590
Think twice!

18
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,870
His Majesty has ordered a retreat.

19
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,150
As soon as the princess arrives,

20
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,270
Prince Yi will be able to return.

21
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,020
Why do you bother to rescue him?

22
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,630
The king of Northland captured Yi

23
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,870
and threatened us to give him five cities.

24
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,900
For a great shame like that,

25
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,510
if I can't get my brother back,

26
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,510
how can I go back to the East Mansion?

27
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,430
Rescuing Prince Yi and stopping the marriage

28
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,870
are, of course, great achievements.

29
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,510
But if you lose,

30
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,550
what will do to yourself?

31
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,390
Your Highness,

32
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,030
you're a brave and responsible man.

33
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,350
But now,

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,590
it's not the time to get emotionally involved.

35
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,750
Right now, the future

36
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,990
of Prince Yi is uncertain.

37
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,820
You have to protect yourself.

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,750
It is the best strategy.

39
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,910
If something bad

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,710
really happens to Prince Yi,

41
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,590
then the seat of the Crown Prince

42
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,060
will be secured for you.

43
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,550
You!

44
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,270
In my opinion,

45
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,670
let's follow the order of His Majesty.

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,150
Let's retreat.

47
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,630
Princess of East Mansion arrives.

48
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,710
Your Majesty, after the marriage,

49
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,190
will you really let Prince Yi go?

50
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,149
That depends on the offer given by

51
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,589
the people who want him.

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,460
I don't want to make enemies everywhere.

53
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,830
But if someone really wants to buy his death,

54
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,790
I'd have to consider how to set him up.

55
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,590
Your Highness.

56
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,710
You can't lift your veil.

57
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,630
Who said the women
of the East Mansion were full-figured?

58
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,270
She is clearly a nightmare.

59
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,070
I heard there is

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,630
a particularly evil underground prison.

61
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,100
Brother Yi is likely to be locked in there.

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,590
My lady, just focus on your marriage.

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,670
Leave the rescue to me.

64
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,950
I know you're good.

65
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,110
But the mission of covering you tonight

66
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,220
is what I should do, right?

67
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,110
Keep a low profile.

68
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,670
Yes, I know.

69
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,310
Quick.

70
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,990
Your Majesty,

71
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,670
our goal is the five cities.

72
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,350
Just bear it.

73
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,030
Your Highness is

74
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,830
so ug...

75
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,470
So beautiful.

76
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,590
You definitely can bring good fortune to me.

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,590
Your Majesty is so st...

78
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,510
So smart and talented.

79
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,950
You're indeed one of the kind.

80
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,990
Your Highness is so enthusiastic!

81
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,510
I like that!

82
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,510
So what are you waiting for?

83
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,990
Let's go and have our first night!

84
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,670
Your Highness...

85
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,550
Hurry up!

86
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,630
Wh... What...

87
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,150
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

88
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,430
This is improper.

89
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,750
Your Majesty.

90
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,590
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,710
If Your Majesty doesn't like this,

92
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,270
later, I will

93
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,950
send Your Majesty

94
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,500
these dancers.

95
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,870
To please Your Majesty's

96
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,270
lonely night.

97
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,430
What are you whispering about?

98
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,540
Tonight,

99
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,350
you have to drink with me.

100
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,860
Why are you pretending?

101
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,230
I knew you were happy secretly.

102
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,430
I'm good, aren't I?

103
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,150
The maid who came with you,

104
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,310
where is she now?

105
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,990
She feels sick now.

106
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,350
She is throwing up.

107
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,870
Do you like her, right?

108
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,030
No.

109
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,710
How can I like her?

110
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,070
We haven't even know who is the winner.

111
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,510
Come on! Drink!

112
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,140
Drink!

113
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,110
That's right!

114
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,510
Let's continue!

115
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,270
This kind of wine is

116
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,669
much more expensive
than the five cities in my hands.

117
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,900
Be careful, dear!

118
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,230
Be careful, dear!

119
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,310
Be careful, my dear!

120
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,830
Your Highness.

121
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,830
You're so strong.

122
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,270
How can you, my dear,
look at me with such affection?

123
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,470
Raise your bowls.

124
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,990
Cheers!

125
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,590
It's been a long time.

126
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,790
Come on. Come on.

127
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,710
Bottoms up!

128
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,750
Bottoms up!

129
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,430
Come on!

130
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,870
Do me a favor!

131
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,260
Come on!

132
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,550
Come on! Come on!

133
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,990
Drink it!

134
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,350
Bottoms up!

135
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,870
Brothers!

136
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,430
Dear brothers!

137
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,190
Come on! Come on!

138
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,590
Drink more. Drink more.

139
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,750
What is it?

140
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,710
This is good wine.

141
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,950
You'll regret it if you don't drink.

142
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,750
Come on.

143
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,590
Thank you, bro.

144
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,750
This one is brought by

145
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,310
His Majesty's wife from the East Mansion.

146
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,350
I heard that after drinking,

147
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,710
you can see your world with your own filters.

148
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,750
What is

149
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,740
fil... filter?

150
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,870
That means

151
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,620
after drinking,
everything will be more beautiful.

152
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,990
Yes, yes, yes.

153
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,270
So you mean after drinking,

154
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,390
I can have a beauty from the East Mansion?

155
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,150
How do you know if you don't try?

156
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,550
Here, have some more.

157
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,230
Drink more.

158
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,270
Didn't you just say

159
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,910
this wine can give me filters?

160
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,270
Yeah!

161
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,270
I heard that

162
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,950
His Majesty is deeply attracted by

163
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,660
his new wife.

164
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,430
Do you guys want to check it out?

165
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,110
Why don't you go?

166
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,630
I...

167
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,220
I have different needs.

168
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,030
All right, all right, all right.

169
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,470
In that cell at the back

170
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,420
is locked a serious offender.

171
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,950
He just got beaten up by us.

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,190
Don't let him die.

173
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,510
I got it.

174
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,510
Let's go!

175
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,910
Let's go to see fairies.

176
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
Brothers, slow down. Be careful.

177
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,910
Slow down. Slow down.

178
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,270
Watch out.

179
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,390
Did you see the fairly?

180
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,510
Yes.

181
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,230
That wine

182
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,340
is really extraordinary.

183
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,510
Does it hurt?

184
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,910
You promised to be good.

185
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,470
Is this what you think is good?

186
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,220
How can't I open this?

187
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,990
Why am I so useless?

188
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,910
You must be in a lot of pain, right?

189
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,990
Wait for me.

190
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,950
I'll get you out of here.

191
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,070
For someone as stupid as you,

192
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,790
how can you manage to get in?

193
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,870
Be good.

194
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,470
Don't cry.

195
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,070
If your cry,

196
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,270
your makeup will be smudged.

197
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,150
Aren't I already standing here safe and sound?

198
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,030
Safe and sound?

199
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,230
You're not safe nor sound.

200
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,830
I thought I would never see you again.

201
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,390
You don't even know what I've been through.

202
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,830
Si Yan.

203
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,110
You two must have watched
too many historical dramas, right?

204
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,030
Don't you know your situation now?

205
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,580
You'd better run for your life!

206
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,390
Good!

207
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,470
I once

208
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,150
thought that no one could

209
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,990
beat me in drinking.

210
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,350
I didn't expect

211
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,310
Your Highness was so good at it.

212
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,470
Today is the day of our wedding.

213
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,070
Of course, we have to drink.

214
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,310
Get up!

215
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,430
No. No.

216
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,270
Wait a second.

217
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,350
I am really happy today.

218
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,950
I have a husband!

219
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,830
I have my own home now!

220
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,670
Your Highness

221
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,430
really sees the desert as

222
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,790
your home?

223
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,070
I can decide this myself.

224
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,150
I don't have to hide

225
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,910
and pretend to be mysterious anymore.

226
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,670
I thought a princess

227
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,220
should be

228
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,230
delicate, frail,

229
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,150
Delicate and frail.

230
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,060
and reluctant to marry me.

231
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,470
I didn't expect...

232
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,550
I didn't expect...

233
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,190
I never thought you would be so...

234
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:19,790
I...

235
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,750
Would I be so...

236
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,630
Would I be so ugly?

237
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,589
No. No.

238
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,670
I tell you what.

239
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,230
The...

240
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,510
This wine from the East Mansion

241
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,110
will take you no more than 3 jars

242
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,430
to get you so drunk

243
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,390
that you can't tell the difference
between beauty and ugliness.

244
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,830
Drink! Drink!

245
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,630
Fine. Let's drink.

246
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,030
I...

247
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,550
What I want to say is that

248
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,510
you...

249
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,510
I...

250
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,750
You're goo...

251
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,790
Your Highness.

252
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,220
I seem to understand

253
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,230
the magic of this wine.

254
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,670
Slow down. Slow down.

255
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,390
Why are you still here?

256
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,150
I wonder about that too.

257
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,190
I've worked so hard to

258
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,910
get myself upgraded,

259
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,180
but I'm still trapped here now.

260
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,510
What about you?

261
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,110
You're doing nothing and idle.

262
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,950
The only thing your know is
having a boyfriend.

263
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,580
Do you know each other?

264
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,420
No.

265
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,910
No.

266
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,430
We've never seen each other.

267
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,190
Let's go.

268
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,190
Let's go this way.

269
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,270
What a coincidence,

270
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,190
little maid.

271
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,270
I am also here to save Prince Yi,

272
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,390
but the direction is the opposite of yours.

273
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,590
Let's go.

274
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,550
This way.

275
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,950
This way.

276
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,630
Tong Rui.

277
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,630
Let's get everything clear today.

278
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,750
What is the purpose of your approaching him?

279
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,030
What exactly is your mission?

280
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,350
How can Glasses be so hot?

281
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,990
So what are you doing here?

282
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,430
Do I need to report to you wherever I go?

283
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,420
Prince Yi,

284
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,190
will we follow the plan or not?

285
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,790
Whose plan do you follow?

286
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,150
Qi Yi, do you want to come with me or not?

287
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,590
Someone is here!

288
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,180
Stop!

289
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,070
What are you doing?

290
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,590
Take the secret passage.

291
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,990
Catch them!

292
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,110
Close the door.

293
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,780
Where is this place?

294
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,390
Go this way.

295
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,950
Go this way.

296
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,150
Why should I listen to you?

297
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,190
So who should I listen to?

298
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,230
What are we two fighting for?

299
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,580
Qi Yi has investigated here.

300
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,950
He must know, right?

301
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,910
How about we have rock paper scissors?

302
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,310
Rock paper scissors.

303
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,070
Here is the mission.

304
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,950
Won't that reveal that we are players?

305
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,550
No kidding.

306
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,270
I know this one.

307
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,590
Three.

308
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,190
I'm the one bringing wine here.

309
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,070
But I also want to ask you

310
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,550
something about the First Lady?

311
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,470
Did you set me up back then?

312
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,190
Four.

313
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,030
At the front gate, I got another one.

314
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,670
The candle was lit.

315
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,190
It was extinguished

316
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,390
I remember I was tripped back then.

317
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,790
You always make things so much worse.

318
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,350
You are just guessing.

319
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,950
My ability to read people's minds

320
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,990
is developed by you, Si Yan.

321
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,670
Then you are still ungrateful.

322
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
The last question.

323
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,470
Don't be impulsive.

324
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,790
A good memory is all you have.

325
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,990
I'm not as stupid as you said I was.

326
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,670
I know this one.

327
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,670
See? I'm right.

328
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,030
Rock paper scissors?

329
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,470
Go this way!

330
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,030
Let's go.

331
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,750
How can we get out of here?

332
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,230
There is light there.

333
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,700
Where the hell is the exit?

334
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,670
Exit.

335
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,350
It's written here clearly.

336
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,230
It seems that the system is to play us to death.

337
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,430
Who is the system?

338
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,630
Not important!

339
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,950
What the hell?

340
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,790
You also know kung fu?

341
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,750
Xiao Li.

342
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,870
You two stop fighting.

343
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,510
I know him.

344
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,430
Si Yan.

345
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,590
I'll take you out of here.

346
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,990
I know him.

347
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,590
He can be trusted.

348
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,950
All down!

349
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,190
Come on.

350
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,870
Let's all raise our cups.

351
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,030
Cheers!

352
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,550
General Min.

353
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,550
Prince Yi.

354
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,030
This is the surrender letter sent by Northland.

355
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,030
They not only return the five cities

356
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,230
that the princess has,

357
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,350
but also signed an agreement,
promising never to harass our borders.

358
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,710
All these

359
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,110
are because Your Highness

360
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,710
has found the secret passage.

361
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,550
So we don't need to spend a single soldier

362
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,430
to

363
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,390
make the Northland surrender so quickly.

364
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,870
Yes.

365
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,550
Regardless of the danger,

366
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,510
Prince Yi saved Prince Da.

367
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,950
Then he went deep into the enemy's base

368
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,390
and found out the location
of the secret passage.

369
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,550
He is indeed an honorable,

370
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,660
brave and smart man.

371
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,950
Having him is the East Mansion's fortune

372
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,910
and the world's fortune, too.

373
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,950
Your Highness is very wise.

374
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,670
Thank you for your compliment.

375
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,540
I'm just doing my job.

376
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,150
Thanks to the timely rescue
of General Min and Prince Da,

377
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,310
I was able to get away.

378
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,590
To be honest,

379
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,550
the credit is all yours.

380
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,230
I dare not take credit for it.

381
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,430
Here.

382
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,940
A toast to General Min.

383
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,390
But I still have one thing I don't understand.

384
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,950
Your army is brave and good at fighting.

385
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,230
The Northland can't defeat you.

386
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,750
But every year, after they were defeated,

387
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,150
they would come back next year.

388
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,990
The king of the Northland is not stupid.

389
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,190
He knew he couldn't win the fight

390
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,470
but still sent troops.

391
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,390
Why?

392
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,070
What do you mean, Your Highness?

393
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,550
Unless

394
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,510
he can gain some profits
from the battles with us.

395
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,750
The wars were profitable.

396
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,220
Good.

397
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,470
Good!

398
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,590
Nice dance.

399
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,110
I'm no-account.

400
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,030
Oh my.

401
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,070
She is General Min's daughter, Miss Min.

402
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,830
Then who is that "Miss Min" before?

403
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,550
Her maid?

404
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,350
Miss Tong.

405
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,750
Your Highness.

406
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,350
A toast to you.

407
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,710
I hope that you can forgive me

408
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,350
for pretending to be a maid.

409
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,150
Your Highness.

410
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,510
I truly appreciate

411
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,910
you risked your life to save me.

412
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,310
But I hope that what happened before,

413
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,670
only Heaven

414
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,150
and earth know.

415
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,390
Prince Yi.

416
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,630
A toast to you, too.

417
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,630
Without your blessing,

418
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,350
I'm afraid I couldn't have escaped
from the Northland.

419
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,940
You're welcome, Miss Min.

420
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,190
If not for you,

421
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,190
we couldn't have gotten out of there.

422
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,870
How can Your Highness still call me Miss Min?

423
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,350
It's a bit strange.

424
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,030
Don't you forget that

425
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,910
we're still engaged,

426
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,630
do you?

427
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,230
Brother Yi.

428
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,470
Where did this maid come from?

429
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,830
So rude.

430
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,230
Clean the mess now.

431
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,380
Father.

432
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,470
Don't blame her.

433
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,950
When I was in the East Mansion,

434
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,310
I got along with this maid well.

435
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,830
She also helped us

436
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,870
get out of the Northland.

437
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,470
Clean up quickly.

438
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,590
Si Yan.

439
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,230
Prince Yi.

440
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,390
Tonight let's sing and have fun.

441
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,510
Rui.

442
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,790
You take the lead.

443
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,910
Prince Yi.

444
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,030
May I?

445
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,270
Si Yan.

446
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,300
What's wrong with you?

447
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,110
I don't want to say anything.

448
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,700
I'm so angry.

449
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,070
Why are you here?

450
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,430
I have saved Prince Yi,

451
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,950
making up for my past mistake.

452
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,830
I'm a guard now.

453
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,030
In the future, we can work together.

454
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,590
Really?

455
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,070
You are a guard now!

456
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,790
Yeah.

457
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,430
Jack.

458
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,060
Don't mention that person so often.

459
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm not him.

460
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,830
Though I'm not that person,

461
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,190
I'm a guard now.

462
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,870
You're a maid.

463
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,140
We will be a perfect match.

464
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,110
You...

465
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,870
You're a sweet talker now.

466
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,070
Si Yan.

467
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,030
Let's go dancing, too.

468
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,350
Forget it.

469
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,910
I don't want to be a part of that.

470
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,230
Let's go.

471
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,070
Let's go.

472
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,310
Come.

473
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,750
Is this your first time dancing, Brother Yi?

474
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,510
Tomorrow we will leave for the East Mansion.

475
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,630
I will personally apologize to
His Majesty and the First Lady.

476
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,470
Aren't you going to say something to me?

477
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,310
What do you want me to say?

478
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,350
Get aside.

479
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,990
Xiao Li.

480
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,710
Let's go dancing, too.

481
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,430
Good.

482
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,190
Can I have a dance with you?

483
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,590
Now you come.

484
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,070
However,

485
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,270
yes.

486
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,750
I mean to dance with you.

487
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,750
Your Highness, please calm down.

488
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,030
How many other things are you hiding from me?

489
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,670
First, you were the maid, Peach.

490
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,070
Later, you dressed up like a boy,
called Mr. Tong.

491
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,830
Now you're Miss Min.

492
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,350
Tell me.

493
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,750
How should I calm down?

494
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,070
I have no intention to lie to you.

495
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,670
However,

496
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,870
I have my own difficulties.

497
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,910
I can ignore all these.

498
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,940
I just want to know the way you feel about me

499
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,830
is true

500
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,310
or not.

501
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,070
I...

502
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,150
Just now, you flirted with Yi.

503
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,070
What does that mean?

504
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,220
I can sacrifice my life for you.

505
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,590
Look at me.

506
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,190
To you, who am I?

507
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,070
He and I are engaged.

508
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,550
This has nothing to do with Your Highness.

509
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,790
This time I was able to
get out of the Northland via a secret passage,

510
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,990
thanks to your help.

511
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,110
I am not that capable.

512
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,310
I just want to get a job.

513
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,150
When did you meet Si Yan?

514
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,590
The correct way to say this is

515
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,710
she picked me up.

516
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,750
So, I decided to follow her till I die.

517
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,830
Is your hand okay?

518
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,550
I'm fine.

519
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,950
What did you talk about?

520
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,950
How come you never told me

521
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,670
you had a friend like Xiao Li?

522
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,110
I remember I told you so.

523
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,870
You don't remember, do you?

524
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,910
You didn't.

525
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,990
If you can't drink, then don't drink.

526
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,070
You make a fuss every day.

527
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,750
I didn't expect you to be such a bad drinker.

528
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,630
I'll tell you what.

529
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,710
This lady will never sleep in a bunk.

530
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,470
Screw your agritourism!

531
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,630
Come on.

532
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,740
Put me down.

533
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,390
I need to

534
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,710
stay in a suite with a mattress.

535
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,030
I have to have an infinity pool.

536
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,590
Do you get it?

537
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,710
What are you talking about?

538
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,070
I'll let you live in my room.

539
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,980
Let's go.

540
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,550
Then...

541
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,390
Where will you live?

542
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,230
Brother Yi.

543
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,590
The Min Mansion is a bit far away
from the East Mansion.

544
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,990
You will be very tired.

545
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,070
Last night I heard a servant say

546
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,230
you enjoyed the moonlight
in the courtyard all night.

547
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,070
What a pleasure!

548
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,390
A spy's job is really difficult.

549
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,590
If I had known that,

550
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,990
I would have bought him a drink.

551
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,220
Who asked you to come?

552
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,470
Of course, I am here to serve the two masters!

553
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,310
Brother Yi.

554
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,830
It's a long journey.

555
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,990
I have made some dessert.

556
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,030
Have a taste.

557
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,470
What a coincide!

558
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,790
I have made some, too.

559
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,900
I have made some.

560
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,550
With your clumsy hands?
Don't embarrass yourself here.

561
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,950
Your hands?

562
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,380
Si Yan, what happened to your hands?

563
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,830
At least, my hands work faster than your brain.

564
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,430
Your brain?

565
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,910
Brother Yi.

566
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,550
I do have a bit of a headache
and feel short of breath.

567
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,630
How about we get a new carriage?

568
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,270
What a great smell of bitch!

569
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,070
Stop playing like a bitch.

570
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,900
What kind of beach

571
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,310
can have such a strong smell?

572
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,390
A conniving little bitch.

573
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,470
Do you want to fight with me?

574
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,940
Will I lose to you or somewhat?

575
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,270
Good. Let's battle it out.

576
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,470
Fine. Battle it out.

577
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,470
What is the battle about?

578
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,910
Dancing.

579
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,350
Dancing.

580
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,260
Who's afraid of who?

581
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,830
Bring it on.
