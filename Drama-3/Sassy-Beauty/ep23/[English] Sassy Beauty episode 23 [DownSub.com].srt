1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,670
Si Yan?

3
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,950
Had I known, I wouldn't have held it like so.

4
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,390
Rehearsing the wedding for the master

5
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,830
is tiring.

6
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,070
Why do you agree to marry her?

7
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,510
Bao,

8
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,030
it doesn't concern you.

9
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,870
Why did you do that to Si Yan?

10
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,390
Don't go.

11
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,510
Explain yourself.

12
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,260
Qi Yi!

13
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,830
Brother Da!

14
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,030
Since you were young,

15
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,820
you have never changed.

16
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,030
You own everything,

17
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
but you want everything from others.

18
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,550
You don't like Tong Rui.

19
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,909
Why do you agree to marry her?

20
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,110
Say something!

21
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,350
I have nothing to say to you.

22
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,550
Let him go.

23
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,470
Your flute sounds

24
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,900
miserable and mournful.

25
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,910
People might think you just broke up.

26
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,430
Parents' orders.

27
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,190
Matchmaker's arrangement.

28
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,870
A well-matched couple

29
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,660
loves each other.

30
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,350
But who should marry whom?

31
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,630
If you want to see me, Uncle,

32
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,150
send me a message and I'll go to you.

33
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,950
You don't need to make a trip in person.

34
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,909
Where is the thing?

35
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,659
I haven't found it.

36
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,950
Is it that you haven't found it?

37
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,350
Or you don't want to look for it?

38
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,110
Have you forgotten

39
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,710
how your dad tragically died in East City?

40
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,230
If you can't find the heartbreak grass recipe,

41
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,550
I'll take over.

42
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,310
If I hurt Prince Xiu by accident,

43
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,110
don't blame me for that.

44
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,710
Don't go.

45
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,590
You can only leave

46
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,470
after finishing the wedding wine.

47
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,030
Si Yan,

48
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,510
listen to me.

49
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,310
Tomorrow's wedding

50
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,310
has other purposes.

51
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,470
Prince Yi,

52
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,550
the only emotion I have right now

53
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,630
is gratitude.

54
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,630
Please dismiss me.

55
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,430
Mother?

56
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,830
Mother?

57
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,830
Vengeful?

58
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,830
The woman you love and the crowned prince title

59
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,190
are both taken away.

60
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,470
Prince Da, you are miserable.

61
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,870
If you are here for a late-night stroll,

62
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,670
please excuse me.

63
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,110
I see that you don't wish

64
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,310
someone could solve the problem for you.

65
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,630
Why is my father's half piece of

66
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,790
Tiger tally with you?

67
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,470
It doesn't matter how I got it.

68
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,830
What's important is

69
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,910
how you get what you want with it.

70
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,750
Don't you know it's a crime to take the tally
 without permission?

71
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,350
It depends on who takes it.

72
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,230
If the future King of East City takes it,

73
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,470
it's not a crime.

74
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,900
Do you mean...

75
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,710
I should

76
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,270
revolt?

77
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,030
Everything belongs to you.

78
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,190
It's not revolting.

79
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,430
You are just using it

80
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,110
to get what you want.

81
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,150
You fulfilled your duty for East City,

82
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,430
but it's all for nothing in the end.

83
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,510
I don't know how you feel.

84
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,430
Right now, my brother has

85
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,670
the other half of the tally.

86
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,590
When the two halves match,

87
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,630
you can deploy the troops of East City.

88
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,350
As long as you commit to it,

89
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,310
the Mins shall spare no effort.

90
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,910
What do you want?

91
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm doing this for Rui.

92
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,230
I can tell that

93
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,030
the person in her heart is you.

94
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,190
I don't want her to follow in my footsteps

95
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,830
and marry someone she doesn't love

96
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,180
to uphold the Mins' power and status.

97
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,270
I trust that you

98
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,190
wouldn't want to see that happen.

99
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,340
Now the chance

100
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,190
has presented itself to you.

101
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,660
It's up for grabs if you have the courage.

102
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Qi Da,

103
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,030
is it you?

104
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,340
Farewell.

105
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,590
After tomorrow...

106
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,460
After tomorrow,

107
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,310
East City will be mine.

108
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,630
What are you going to do?

109
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,710
Don't you always want me to become
 the crowned prince?

110
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,510
If this is what you want,

111
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,830
I'll give you that.

112
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,590
I don't care if I'll risk everything I have.

113
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,870
You can't change the ending anymore.

114
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,790
Master,

115
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,910
you've been sitting here since yesterday.

116
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,150
You have been waiting for the whole night,

117
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,910
and haven't had any water.

118
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,230
Who are you waiting for?

119
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,670
Why did you nod your head

120
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,190
and then shake your head?

121
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,630
I'm waiting for someone who'd never come.

122
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,070
I'm not sure if I should keep waiting.

123
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,670
Is it a friend?

124
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,910
A confidant?

125
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,630
Or a lover?

126
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,830
She's everything.

127
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,830
It seems that you've expected the outcome.

128
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,030
You can say that

129
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,150
I used to be a person with no future.

130
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,030
Only after she walked into my life,

131
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,230
I started to save many moments.

132
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,670
Are those the moments of

133
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,830
you loving each other and being together?

134
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,910
Quietly standing next to her,

135
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,870
I watched as she busied herself in the kitchen.

136
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,150
When she messed up on her makeup,

137
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,990
I watched the messy look on her face.

138
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,150
I watched as she went on the hustle and bustle

139
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,670
of her everyday life.

140
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,070
I even...

141
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,310
I even watched her taken into the arms of someone

142
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,470
with tears in her eyes,

143
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,990
feeling hurt and wronged.

144
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,670
Time-out, Jack!

145
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,990
Master,

146
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,510
to love someone or not, that is the question.

147
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
I believe that

148
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,030
in her eyes,

149
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,510
there must be you.

150
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,150
Can she see me?

151
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,190
Yeah,

152
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,390
her in your eyes

153
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,750
reflects you in her eyes.

154
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,150
After tonight,

155
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,590
you can get out of here.

156
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,510
Si Yan,

157
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,830
thank you,

158
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,550
but are you sure that

159
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,150
you want to stay here?

160
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,100
After you get out,

161
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,350
if there's a chance,

162
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,670
please say hello to my old man for me.

163
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,900
Tell him

164
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,670
that I'm fine.

165
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,750
Tell him not to worry.

166
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,150
Si Yan,

167
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,140
did you think it through?

168
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,030
I know

169
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,870
you won't complete the task of killing Qi Yi.

170
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,630
But to give up your family who's been waiting for you,

171
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,750
are you sure you're ready for that?

172
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,030
Everything here

173
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,070
is a world constructed by data.

174
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,110
It looks realistic,

175
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,670
but dangers are everywhere.

176
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,190
Though we are players,

177
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,060
when it comes to the business in gaming,

178
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,950
you either win or lose.

179
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,110
My lady,

180
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,350
The Second Lady sent me to tell you that

181
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,390
General Min went to Treasure Pavilion

182
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,230
to pick up the special wedding gift he got for you

183
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,350
and was delayed.

184
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,070
He may not make it back by the auspicious time.

185
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,070
The auspicious time shall not change.

186
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,270
Please wait for my father outside the mansion

187
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,910
and tell my aunt that

188
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,670
the ceremony will proceed as planned.

189
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,350
Yes, my lady.

190
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,750
Lan Miao!

191
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,190
Where have you been?

192
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,390
Give my hairpin back.

193
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,270
Qi Yi,

194
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,510
talented in academics and martial arts,

195
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,630
born with intelligence and wisdom,

196
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,910
gentle and well-mannered,

197
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,350
dutiful of parents and respectful to siblings,

198
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,910
capable of battling at war

199
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,630
and governing at court.

200
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,150
I announced Qi Yi as the crowned prince.

201
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,870
He shall carry on responsibilities
 from ancestors

202
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,190
and unify the people of East City.

203
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,430
Yi,

204
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,030
it's your wedding day.

205
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,150
After today,

206
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,990
the weight on your shoulders is heavier.

207
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,670
I must not disappoint you, Father.

208
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,550
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

209
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,550
Congratulations, Crowned Prince.

210
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,700
Commence the ceremony.

211
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,950
Bow to the earth and sky.

212
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,100
Bow to the parents.

213
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,590
Bow to each other.

214
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,300
Doctor, the patient is responsive.

215
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,350
Big brother!

216
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:11,870
Da!

217
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,750
What are you doing?

218
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,790
It's a family business.

219
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,270
Get lost if you don't want to die.

220
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,710
Okay.

221
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,390
All of you, leave now.

222
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,110
Run! Prince Da is committing treason!

223
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,990
Hurry! Run!

224
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,630
Si Yan,

225
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,350
I have a bad feeling.

226
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,830
On my wedding day,

227
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,310
my father didn't show up.

228
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,670
I'm afraid

229
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,910
something is wrong.

230
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,660
Do you suspect

231
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,750
General Min to be behind all this?

232
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,830
Based on my understanding of the game plot,

233
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,950
General Min is a good person who's loyal to East City.

234
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,190
I hope that I am over-worried.

235
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,550
This is bad. I have to find General Min.

236
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,150
Say what you are scheming.

237
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,990
I want to leave with the woman I love.

238
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,340
Since I can't rightfully take her with me,

239
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,470
I can only get those

240
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,990
that are supposed to be mine.

241
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,070
Brother Da...

242
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,110
Don't call me brother!

243
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,380
Yi,

244
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,550
don't stop him.

245
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,100
Let him speak his mind.

246
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,150
You're an unruly son!

247
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,510
Merely for a woman...

248
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,070
Enough!

249
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,910
She is the only person who understands me.

250
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,030
She never looked down on me,

251
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,870
unlike you.

252
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,390
No matter what I do,

253
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,550
I can't get your recognition.

254
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,190
You never cared about me.

255
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,230
If you hate me so much,

256
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,310
why did you bring me to the world?

257
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,510
Didn't you say that

258
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,150
I accomplished nothing,

259
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,340
and I am a failure?

260
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,350
I'll show you what I can do today.

261
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,310
You wouldn't make me the crowned prince.

262
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,390
I'll make myself one.

263
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,110
Look at this yourself!

264
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,630
Father,

265
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,150
Luna is a scapegoat.

266
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,030
Someone else is behind this.

267
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,830
Yi,

268
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,430
I have an idea.

269
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,350
I want to make you the fake crowned prince

270
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,110
and use the wedding as bait.

271
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,670
The person behind this

272
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,350
would certainly take action.

273
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,870
Father...

274
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,340
The patient's vitals are dropping!

275
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,150
Her breathing is weak.

276
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,190
Rui?

277
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,670
Rui?

278
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,390
Rui!

279
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,340
General Min?

280
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,990
Prince Bao?

281
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,270
Prince Bao?

282
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,950
Prince Bao!

283
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,750
Are you still worried about Prince Yi

284
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,230
and Si Yan?

285
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,310
Do you still have feelings for

286
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,150
Si Yan?

287
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,060
Lan Miao,

288
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,030
don't you think

289
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,110
my mother has been acting strange?

290
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,590
What makes you think so?

291
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,430
She suddenly asked us

292
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,350
to bring the baby princess to the royal retreat

293
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,230
and we must set off right away.

294
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,310
It is very unlike her.

295
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,300
The Second Lady told us the reason, didn't she?

296
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,350
The weather is warm in the retreat,

297
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,870
so it's better for the health of the baby princess.

298
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,190
She also wants you to take a break
 and get some fresh air.

299
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,550
But...

300
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,070
now that you mentioned it,

301
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,590
I do think that

302
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,470
the Second Lady looked downhearted recently.

303
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,989
Every night when she held the baby princess
 in her arms,

304
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,150
she was secretly shedding tears.

305
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,830
Since when was she like that?

306
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,429
Since the assassin died.

307
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,070
The Second Lady said the assassin had so much grudge

308
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,310
that it was unhealthy for the baby princess.

309
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,750
After dinner,

310
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,429
she dismissed all the guards

311
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,380
and page boys

312
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,429
and didn't allow anyone to wait on her.

313
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,870
Lan Miao,

314
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,900
we have to go back.

315
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,070
Qi Da! Qi Da!

316
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,110
You can't even complete a simple task.

317
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,110
No wonder the King said that you're useless!

318
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,949
You planned all of this!

319
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,989
You finally showed yourself!

320
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,790
The Qixi assault case,

321
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,860
the Cloud Brothel case,

322
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,510
and the loss of food and fodder...

323
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,990
You are behind them all, aren't you?

324
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,900
Three years ago when Cloud Brothel had a fire,

325
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,230
it wasn't a coincidence that you were there.

326
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,100
You went there to meet the Northland King

327
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,030
and plotted

328
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,870
to trap Prince Teng!

329
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,670
My Teng?

330
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,460
You're right.

331
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,990
I sent Qi Teng to the Northland King,

332
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,790
but I didn't expect him

333
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,630
to threaten me because of that.

334
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,470
He asked me to provide food and fodder.

335
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,380
He would have exposed me had I said no.

336
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,230
But that worked out just as well.

337
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,070
I could strengthen my power by the war.

338
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,870
It's you who got Teng killed?

339
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,590
Dear...

340
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,150
Mother!

341
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,790
Dear!

342
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,700
Min Ling,

343
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,310
I order you to withdraw the troops immediately.

344
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,990
Or else

345
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,190
you are doomed.

346
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,630
You should worry about yourself first.

347
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,070
Nobody moves!

348
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,470
Min Ling,

349
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,750
what exactly do you want?

350
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,190
Re-draft the edict

351
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,630
and make Qi Bao the crowned prince.

352
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,950
Never!

353
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,750
If you don't agree,

354
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,470
they'll die in front of you one by one.

355
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,150
Okay.

356
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,350
Fine.

357
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,910
I'll do it.

358
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,990
Hold on!

359
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,310
Let General Min through.

360
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,790
Brother.

361
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,910
Bring Rui out of here first.

362
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,670
Please stop here!

363
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,990
The rebels have been purged.

364
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,550
Don't make any more mistakes!

365
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,830
I'm about to succeed.

366
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,540
East City will be mine soon.

367
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,230
It will belong to the Mins soon.

368
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,350
Why are you stopping me?

369
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,820
Didn't you want me

370
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,990
to earn my place in East City?

371
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,030
For that, despite my pleading,

372
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,350
you married me far to East City.

373
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,620
I'm about to have everything,

374
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,510
but you're pointing at me with a sword.

375
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,510
Ling,

376
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,830
what happened to you?

377
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,230
Why?

378
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,270
You turned me into this.

379
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,750
The Min household turned me into this.

380
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,590
For the Min household,

381
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,510
I gave up my love,

382
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,030
but what did I get in return?

383
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,510
Qing Yan died in front of me,

384
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,630
but I had to pretend that I didn't know him.

385
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,900
I had to suffer in silence!

386
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,070
This place is like a prison.

387
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,260
I can never escape.

388
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,390
Only Qing Yan...

389
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,550
He was always by my side.

390
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,830
I swallowed the pain, worked hard, and step by step,

391
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,510
I made you the most powerful minister in East City.

392
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,910
The Min household became a rainmaker
 in East City because of me.

393
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,350
And now you're asking me

394
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,710
what I've become?

395
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,870
You were the one who told me

396
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,070
only power can set me free!

397
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,310
Just as I'm about to

398
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,590
get everything,

399
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,220
you're pointing your sword at me!

400
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,900
You...

401
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,230
You...

402
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,350
You have turned my whole life into a big joke!

403
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,270
What has happened to me?

404
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,550
Min Ling!

405
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,220
A loser has to accept his fate.

406
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,390
I lost.

407
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,270
Why did you come back?

408
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,860
Let go, let go, let go!

409
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,500
Mother...

410
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,020
Bao...

411
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,150
Father,

412
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,150
please forgive my mother.

413
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,260
I'll accept any consequences for my mother

414
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,390
even if I die.

415
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,310
No, no!

416
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,430
Drop the sword. Drop it!

417
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,470
Drop it now!

418
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,430
Please don't...

419
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,190
I was late

420
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,630
to the rescue!

421
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,350
I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness.

422
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,590
Everything that happened

423
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,750
was caused by the Min household.

424
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,990
I ruined Ling's life.

425
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,430
I beg Your Majesty to let Ling live.

426
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,030
If it's not enough,

427
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,430
please take my life instead of hers.

428
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,860
Forget it...

429
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,180
What happened today

430
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,710
has nothing to do with you.

431
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,830
Take my order!

432
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,710
Strip off nobility of Min Ling.

433
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,510
Make her a commoner.

434
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,470
Exile her to the north region.

435
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,830
She shall never return to East City.

436
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,070
Mother,

437
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,830
don't be sad.

438
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,590
I'll do give everything I can

439
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,830
to protect both of you.

440
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,710
Bao,

441
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,550
I have wronged you.

442
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,070
In this big world,

443
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,950
there must be somewhere we can settle down.

444
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,660
I never desire nobility or power.

445
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,390
I only ask to stay by your side

446
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,750
to take care of you.

447
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,270
Furthermore,

448
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,630
I also wanted to

449
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,860
go to the north region.

450
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,870
Prince Bao!

451
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,110
Prince Bao!

452
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:46,990
Prince Bao!

453
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,190
Prince Bao...

454
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,310
Stop the horse!

455
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:07,830
Lan Miao,

456
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,710
why are you here?

457
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:11,950
It's cold in the north region,

458
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,230
so I packed you

459
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,510
some winter clothes.

460
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,030
There are some of your favorite snacks.

461
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,590
If you are not used to the food there,

462
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,750
at least you have these.

463
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,470
How considerate!

464
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,310
Thank you, Lan Miao!

465
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,230
Going forward,

466
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,590
please take care.

467
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,740
Your Highness,

468
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,310
please allow me to go with you.

469
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,070
Nonsense!

470
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,070
Go back!

471
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,460
It's not nonsense.

472
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,670
I mean it.

473
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,310
Although the north region isn't as nice as East City,

474
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,150
and one has to sleep in the open,

475
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,790
and lack clothes and food,

476
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,630
I am not afraid.

477
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,190
Please let me take care of you and the Second Lady.

478
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,870
I am no longer a prince in East City.

479
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,150
Don't be silly.

480
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,310
As for you,

481
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,190
I don't have any feelings for you,

482
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,870
and I don't need you to care for me.

483
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,710
Prince Bao!

484
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:30,830
You kept

485
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,940
this purse.

486
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,710
Prince Bao,

487
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,030
I like you.

488
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,590
I know I was born lowly,

489
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,420
but

490
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,030
I can't control myself from liking you.

491
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,910
I like Qi Bao

492
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,550
regardless of his status

493
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,750
and identity.

494
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,940
I want nothing but to stay by your side.

495
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,860
I want to keep you company.

496
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,710
Take me with you.

497
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,670
Okay.

498
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,750
You said yes!

499
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,590
But on one condition.

500
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,590
No more crying.

501
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,470
The hidden task of the Second Lady is completed,

502
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,310
which means

503
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,990
I won't need to kill Qi Yi!

504
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:38,830
Si Yan,

505
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,350
I'll be waiting for you at the posting station

506
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,910
until you come.

507
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,510
No one can

508
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,470
separate us now.

509
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,630
Wait for me.

510
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,870
There's something I need to do.
