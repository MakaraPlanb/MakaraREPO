1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,510
Prince Xiu decorated it so romantically!

3
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,390
So sweet!

4
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,870
The afternoon sunlight is strong,

5
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,710
and the temperature is high.

6
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,190
When Her Ladyships stay outdoors for a long time,

7
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,350
the skin can become oily.

8
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,750
Here are the cleansing muds

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,829
from UNIFON

10
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,750
for Her Ladyships.

11
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
When the fall hunt is over,

12
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,750
Her Ladyships' skin is guaranteed

13
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,630
to stay as smooth as before.

14
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,590
The cleansing muds

15
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,790
have won my heart.

16
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,430
When will we get the hats?

17
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,510
Her Ladyships are waiting.

18
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,430
It's very hot.

19
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,870
If Her Ladyships get sunburned,

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,710
you must take full responsibility.

21
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,110
Don't worry.

22
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,750
The hats are on the way.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,510
They'll be here shortly.

24
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,020
How much longer do we need to wait?

25
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,230
We've been waiting for hours.

26
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,540
Who knows if you're lying?

27
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,230
It's been more than two hours.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,590
We haven't seen the hats.

29
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,190
Are you buying time on purpose

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,470
because you didn't get us hats?

31
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,990
What is going on?

32
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,620
Do we have hats or not?

33
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,150
Tell us.

34
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,350
Stop making a fuss.

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,990
Here are the hats you want.

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,190
The hats are here.

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,670
Take a break, would you?

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,110
Let others take care of it.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,870
Otherwise, people might think

40
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,020
there aren't enough people working for me

41
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,230
so my wife needs to work hard.

42
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,630
Stop teasing me.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,590
I know you are the sweetest.

44
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,990
His Highness is so sweet!

45
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,070
You overacted.

46
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,790
You, too.

47
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,380
But that's not a bad idea

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,390
to keep people from suspicious.

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,950
Around us,

50
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,030
you never know which ones

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,510
are spying on us for the King and the First Lady.

52
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,390
Did you make the hats?

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,350
Of course.

54
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,110
Your business is my business.

55
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,030
But...

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,750
what's your plan on claiming
 the title of the best hunter?

57
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,670
Do you need my help?

58
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,630
Hunting the most precious game

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,190
is a piece of cake!

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,740
I've never heard that

61
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,070
you have caught
 the most precious game before.

62
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,950
Serious hunting

63
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,020
is not my forte,

64
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:12,990
but...

65
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,350
as for taking shortcuts,

66
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,220
no one can beat me.

67
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,870
Are you gonna cheat?

68
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,150
In a word,

69
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,070
just be ready

70
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,350
to cheer for me then.

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,220
How confident!

72
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,540
Then I'd better make good use of

73
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,390
my status as your wife.

74
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,150
How do I look?

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,510
What a surprise!

76
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,030
Si Yan and Prince Xiu look good together.

77
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,909
As a maid,

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,790
she is lucky to marry up.

79
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,990
After Prince Xiu's wedding,

80
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,230
the two of us...

81
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,470
Why marry up?

82
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,990
If you have to marry up for status,

83
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,510
you are bound to be confined.

84
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,740
Ultimately,

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,990
you'll fall deeply.

86
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,110
Miss Min,

87
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,670
I have to go.

88
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,710
Please excuse me.

89
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,470
Brother Yi,

90
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,470
where are you going?

91
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,540
I am the real Min Tongrui.

92
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,350
Qi Yi is mine.

93
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,100
You've got to participate well

94
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,990
in the autumn hunt this year.

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,150
I know how capable you are!

96
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,830
Claim the best hunter title.

97
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,150
Then

98
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,350
I'll use the opportunity

99
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,980
to ask the King to grant the marriage.

100
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,270
Yi,

101
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,550
are you listening?

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,110
Yi!

103
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,950
Mother,

104
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,500
I know you wholeheartedly hope

105
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,630
that I earn support from the Min household

106
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,070
through marriage.

107
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,390
But do you know what the Mins think?

108
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,070
Do you know

109
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,750
if Miss Min wants to marry me?

110
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,390
What do you mean?

111
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,830
Brother Xiu's marriage is not set in stone yet,

112
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,990
so mine can wait.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,110
What kind of excuse is it?

114
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,790
Prince Xiu's marriage is already set in stone.

115
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,230
Don't tell me that you still like her!

116
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,070
Are you gonna steal the bride?

117
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,750
Speak!

118
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,590
I don't mean that.

119
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,870
Please rest assured.

120
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,110
No matter what,

121
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,310
I'll claim the best hunter title.

122
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,909
You'd better!

123
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,590
Si Yan,

124
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,790
what brought you here?

125
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,350
What were you trying to hide?

126
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,750
Nothing.

127
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,830
Did you finish making the hats?

128
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,470
Thanks to Prince Xiu's help!

129
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,470
Yan,

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,550
you don't need to pretend in front of me.

131
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,910
Aren't you and Prince Xiu just putting up a show?

132
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,030
Don't say that.

133
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,630
We both like each other.

134
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,710
Having met Prince Xiu

135
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,830
is a true blessing.

136
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,020
He is open-minded,

137
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,190
reasonable,

138
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,670
gentle, and considerate.

139
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,110
Having met him

140
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,350
and being with him

141
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,030
has provided me with a sense of security.

142
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,430
As long as he's nice to me,

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,310
I don't care about anything else.

144
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,870
I think

145
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,870
among all the princes,

146
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,870
Prince Xiu will make the best husband.

147
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,630
Your kite looks nice.

148
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,350
I'll make one for my husband-to-be.

149
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,790
What's with the dark circles?

150
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,750
I found some leads on Cloud Brothel.

151
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,870
Another one to spy on me!

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,990
I stayed up and found

153
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,230
something relevant.

154
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,950
Did you find anything suspicious?

155
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,700
Three years ago,

156
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,470
there was indeed a fire.

157
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,789
The fire wasn't big,

158
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,950
and there was not much damage.

159
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,669
So, no one paid much attention to it.

160
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,510
It was when the war broke off in Northland.

161
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,710
Was there any witness?

162
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,470
No.

163
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,430
Luckily the fire happed after midnight,

164
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,350
otherwise, the Second Lady...

165
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,710
The Second Lady?

166
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,950
The Second Lady might know something.

167
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,990
Then shall we ask Second Lady?

168
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,390
Or Miss Si Yan?

169
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,510
It flies so high up!

170
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,750
The string broke!

171
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,460
Your drawing skills

172
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,140
have improved quite a lot.

173
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,230
Your Highness,

174
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,110
you're so skillful.

175
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,550
You tamed this horse in such a short time.

176
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,510
The best hunter title must be yours.

177
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,630
Brother Yi,

178
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,110
who upset you?

179
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,630
Why the long face?

180
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,390
It almost touches the ground.

181
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,270
The Western region sent us several fine horses.

182
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,510
Go and choose one.

183
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,950
You might get nothing if you are too late.

184
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,790
I have picked one.

185
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,030
Sooner than me?

186
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,260
Don't tell me that I put in all the work

187
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,740
on that horse for him.

188
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,510
How does he become so cold again?

189
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,830
It's like going back in time.

190
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,750
I guess my acting is very convincing.

191
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,750
He shouldn't be jealous like that.

192
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,870
Does it bother you?

193
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,390
If so, you should tell him the truth.

194
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,750
If I tell him the truth, the plan of Xiu and I

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,550
will go down the drain.

196
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,790
Furthermore,

197
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,310
why do I need to explain?

198
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,670
Why couldn't he trust me?

199
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,830
Am I someone who eyes what's in other's pot

200
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,990
while eating from my bowl?

201
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,830
Yes, you are.

202
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,390
No, I'm not.

203
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,900
Maybe it's for the best.

204
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,140
Don't you always

205
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,310
want to keep him at arm's length?

206
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,340
But...

207
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,510
But you regretted it?

208
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,230
I did not!

209
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,510
I never regret what I did.

210
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,030
Si Yan,

211
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,710
can I ask you a question?

212
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,100
It is the first time you ask a question.

213
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,380
Go for it.

214
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,430
Do you remember how you got into a car accident?

215
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,100
Why did you ask this?

216
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,910
Si Yan,

217
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,070
running away cannot solve the problem.

218
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,710
What do you mean?

219
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,430
You knew Tong Rui long ago.

220
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,150
She is your personal assistant,

221
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,270
and the daughter of Tong Hui, the game developer.

222
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,030
I retrieved the surveillance video in the hotel

223
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,110
by the entrance on the day of the accident.

224
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,270
She got in the car.

225
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,630
The president arranged

226
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,590
a blind date for you.

227
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,750
A 25-year-old game architect

228
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,070
who is young, rich, and talented.

229
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,870
I heard that

230
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,110
you hate girls who act crazy after drinking.

231
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,470
Fill up

232
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,030
my glass.

233
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,310
Let's toast

234
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,540
to a great date!

235
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,470
Miss, please believe me.

236
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,750
I didn't do it.

237
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,750
You are the mole!

238
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,700
If I sent fake products to clients,

239
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,910
Si Yan's live streaming would...

240
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,540
I don't want her

241
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,270
to do live commerce.

242
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,150
Who do you think

243
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,310
framed me

244
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,630
with the fake product?

245
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,190
I believe

246
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,150
I'll find the answer soon.

247
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,140
Let's go.

248
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,870
I can't do it, Mr. Tong.

249
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,670
You're the mole!

250
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,190
You set me up with my dad.

251
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,350
Firing you is a light punishment.

252
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,430
I didn't do it, Miss.

253
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,990
Go away and don't let me see you again.

254
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,030
I didn't sell fake products.

255
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,750
Someone framed me.

256
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,510
What's wrong, Si Yan?

257
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,150
Who permitted you to do that?

258
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,670
You are my butler.

259
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,750
You have no right to intrude on my privacy.

260
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,910
I found it out by accident

261
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,710
when I was checking players' information.

262
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,030
I was trying to do something for you.

263
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,390
Can you intrude on my privacy

264
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,670
just because you think it's good for me?

265
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,870
You are just my butler.

266
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,670
The things between Tong Rui and I

267
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,310
are not for you to meddle.

268
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,150
Si Yan,

269
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,150
where are you?

270
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,510
The matron wanted you to go to the stable

271
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,030
and bring back the makeup box left on the carriage.

272
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm here.

273
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm coming.

274
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,910
Please do not meddle

275
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,550
in my life from now on.

276
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,750
What I said to Jack...

277
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,020
Was it too harsh?

278
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,340
Should I apologize to him?

279
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,700
Miss Min,

280
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,230
what are you doing here?

281
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,390
You are in no place to mind my business.

282
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,870
Of course, as a maid,

283
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,550
I have no right to ask you any questions.

284
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,950
But...

285
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,350
please do not meddle in my matters in the future.

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,020
I don't care much about it

287
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,900
because I was born intelligent.

288
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,950
Miss Min, you are in a different situation.

289
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,870
You've hoarded up all the hats in the city.

290
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,830
Do you need my help to sell them?

291
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,670
The weather is getting cooler.

292
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,670
I'd hate to see you stuck with those hats.

293
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,910
You can't accuse me as you wish.

294
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,990
If you had the evidence,

295
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,750
you would have told on me to the First Lady.

296
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,270
You wouldn't be here

297
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,510
flustering!

298
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,510
It was her.

299
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,510
If you try to frame me

300
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,390
because of what I said,

301
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,310
you'll regret it.

302
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,150
I advise you...

303
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,070
don't take the risk.

304
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,190
I won't waste any energy on you.

305
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,740
I just want to know

306
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,150
who went through this trouble to set me up.

307
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,550
You only did it

308
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,190
because of Prince Yi.

309
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,190
Such a typical plot
 for the evil supporting actress.

310
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,870
How dare you call me evil?

311
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,230
I'm done with

312
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,950
my business here.

313
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,950
Since you like the smell of manures,

314
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,950
please stay here.

315
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,070
I won't disturb you.

316
00:16:59,470 --> 00:16:59,870
Si Yan,

317
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,670
come here.

318
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,950
How does it look?

319
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,190
Prince Xiu,

320
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,230
this is too much.

321
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,710
Is it?

322
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,790
Yi,

323
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:16,990
come here.

324
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,540
Come here.

325
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,470
How does it look?

326
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,470
Xiu,

327
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,550
since this is the first time you hosted the hunt,

328
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,790
naturally,

329
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,750
you'd like to make it different from the past.

330
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,750
You are right.

331
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,990
I don't think it's too much.

332
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,340
The color looks great.

333
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,350
Qi Xiu.

334
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,150
Greetings, Your Majesty.

335
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,190
Tear it up.

336
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,630
Redecorate it.

337
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,430
Father, you're right.

338
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,310
I also think that

339
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,870
the decoration seems a bit pompous.

340
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,070
Yi,

341
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,950
you didn't say that earlier.

342
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,950
Sorry, Your Highness,

343
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,670
you've got to redecorate.

344
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,430
Nothing but crass comments!

345
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,100
In my opinion,

346
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,710
it's not hard to decorate the hunting preserve.

347
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,710
Just keep things simple.

348
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,710
Keep some plants and flowers.

349
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,950
And get someone

350
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,310
to chop off some firewood.

351
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,270
Boil water and make tea.

352
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,150
This way, not only does it preserve
 the pleasure of being in nature,

353
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,630
but it also helps keep cool and thirst-quenching.

354
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,750
Your idea sounds good.

355
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,220
Then we'll need Si Yan to help.

356
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,430
There's no need.

357
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:36,990
I...

358
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,270
I'll send a few servants to do the job.

359
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,270
Do you not want to exhaust her, Prince Xiu?

360
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,230
You are protective of your wife so soon.

361
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,950
Miss Si Yan,

362
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,990
your charm is pretty irresistible.

363
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,950
Miss Min,

364
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,550
since you know

365
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,700
I am Her Ladyship-to-be,

366
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,180
we are both masters,

367
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,870
you can't give me orders.

368
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,110
If I must go,

369
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,430
we will both go together

370
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,550
in case it's a trap.

371
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,550
Don't you think so?

372
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,700
What do you mean?

373
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,390
Who set you up?

374
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,470
Do you not want to go?

375
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,190
I can't order you to do things,

376
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,950
but the First Lady can.

377
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,430
Since my future-sister-in-law
 has different status now,

378
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,430
then naturally,

379
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,790
you should share more responsibility for Xiu.

380
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,670
Chores like chopping firewood and boiling water

381
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,870
are part of the deal.

382
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,270
Are you telling me to chop off the wood?

383
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,580
Yi doesn't mean that.

384
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,630
Si Yan,

385
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,550
there was a rip by tree branches on my clothes.

386
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,190
Would you accompany me to get changed?

387
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,110
Chores like chopping wood...

388
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,910
I'll send a few servants for the job.

389
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,990
Prince Xiu, you love Si Yan so much.

390
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,670
I'm so envious.

391
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,710
No one will think you're a dumb

392
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,990
if you don't say a word.

393
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,030
Chopping wood is easy.

394
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,310
Where do I go?

395
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,470
Over there.

396
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,670
Isn't there readily available wood there?

397
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,670
I'll go with you.

398
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,870
It's okay.

399
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,390
The hunt is starting.

400
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,430
Focus on the hunt.

401
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,510
Si Yan,

402
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,750
why did you give me the letter?

403
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,620
What are you trying to threaten me?

404
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,470
I did that out of good intention.

405
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,950
Do you admit you're a player?

406
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,310
Do you remember me?

407
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,470
Of course, I do.

408
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,510
Aren't you the Miss Si,

409
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,790
who is capricious and willful?

410
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,910
Could it be that...

411
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,230
she didn't remember what happened
 on the night of the car accident?

412
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,580
I warn you

413
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,820
not to do anything stupid.

414
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,190
As I could make you take off the poster
 for the marriage contest,

415
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,460
I can make you do something else, too.

416
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,190
Like...

417
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,710
Leave East City.

418
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,630
So it's her who made me take off the poster.

419
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,390
There is no hierarchy in the hunting ground.

420
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,270
Today,

421
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,510
you all need to give all you can.

422
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,550
Whoever hunts the top game

423
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,190
will be rewarded well.

424
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,420
Yes, Father.

425
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,350
Xiu and Yi,

426
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,070
I won't go easy on you today.

427
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,310
Who will hunt the top game

428
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,670
is still up in the air.

429
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,580
Then let's wait and see.

430
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,070
In that case, I won't wait for you.

431
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,180
That-a-boy!

432
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,230
Start the hunt!

433
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,070
Start the hunt!

434
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,270
Yun Li,

435
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,230
follow me.

436
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,030
Tong,

437
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,790
why did you bring me here?

438
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,230
Da,

439
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,030
listen up.

440
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,870
Did you hear that?

441
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,630
It sounded like a deer bleating.

442
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,910
Tong,

443
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,550
how did you find the place?

444
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,790
Deer needs water,

445
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,190
and it will stay close to the water source.

446
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,750
It should be near.

447
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,700
It looks like a good decision

448
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,870
to have you tag along.

449
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,950
It seems that

450
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,270
you will surely get the top game!

451
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,740
Let's go.

452
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,870
Saddle up!

453
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,310
Let's go.

454
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,510
I have to kill you

455
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,220
to become Miss Min forever.

456
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,750
We've circled for a while

457
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,430
but haven't seen any rare animals.

458
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,630
And this area...

459
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,830
I thought that we just went past it earlier.

460
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,580
Is that so?

461
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,870
You... you...

462
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,670
you are a woman.

463
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,150
I trusted you the most, but you deceived me!

464
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,070
I don't want to see you again.

465
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,550
Your Highness!

466
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,310
Chopping wood is exhausting.

467
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,710
Ja...

468
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,820
From now on,

469
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,390
please don't intervene.

470
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,180
You are my butler.

471
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,910
You have no right to intrude on my privacy.

472
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,550
You can't do whatever you can

473
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,990
just because you think it's best for me.

474
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,190
You're just my butler.

475
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,030
You should not meddle with

476
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,870
the things between Tong Rui and me.

477
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:45,990
Forget it.

478
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,230
I can do it.

479
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,350
Perhaps...

480
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,270
she doesn't need me that much.

481
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,580
One can't avoid one's enemies.

482
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,910
What is with you?

483
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,070
Sometimes when you take a wrong step,

484
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,590
there's no coming back.

485
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,630
Don't make the same mistake.

486
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,950
I've got the firewoods,

487
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,150
but where do I find the morning dew?

488
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,710
What brought you here?

489
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,910
Sure,

490
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,150
let's go together.

491
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,830
Why are you leaving?

492
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,550
Jack!

493
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,110
Save me, Jack!

494
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,310
Jack!

495
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,190
Save me, Jack!

496
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:15,910
Si Yan?

497
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,030
Si Yan?

498
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,710
Si Yan, wake up!

499
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,470
You're okay.

500
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,990
Don't be afraid.

501
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,630
You've never spoken to me so gently.

502
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,270
You even comforted me.

503
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,060
I must be dying.

504
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,750
You're not dying.

505
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,230
You're poisoned.

506
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,310
The mists are toxic.

507
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,910
Take this.

508
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,350
Take this anti-poison pill,

509
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,950
and you'll be better.

510
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,190
So, people who are good at martial arts

511
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,870
always have elixirs with them.

512
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,910
What do you do

513
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,030
if you give it to me?

514
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,510
I already took one.

515
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,550
Are you a fool?

516
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,350
Why did you go so far

517
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,390
for the firewoods?

518
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,710
Have you been following me?

519
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,190
Are you worried about me?

520
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,750
Typically,

521
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,070
you are defiant.

522
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,430
Why did you do as told this time?

523
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,790
Didn't you want me to go?

524
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,510
I didn't want to,

525
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,900
but I was angry that you took Miss Min's side.

526
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,470
I thought that

527
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,790
I was about to die earlier.

528
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,710
Why did you save me?

529
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,230
Don't you hate me and disbelieve me?

530
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,430
Si Yan!

531
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,230
Si Yan!

532
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,870
I was a fool.

533
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,950
Qi Yi?

534
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,150
Are you okay?

535
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,070
I'm fine.

536
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,510
I've probably stayed in the water for too long.

537
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,270
But...

538
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,350
don't you feel

539
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,510
it is now

540
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,990
much colder?

541
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,990
The mists are toxic.

542
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,830
Take this anti-poison pill,

543
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,510
and you'll be better.

544
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,190
What do you do if you give it to me?

545
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,350
I already took it.

546
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,790
The system is despicable!

547
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,070
For the sake of killing us,

548
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,430
what won't it do?

549
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,510
What nonsense is it?

550
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,950
Did you give me the only elixir?

551
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,550
Are you a fool?

552
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,190
Trying to play the hero at this moment?

553
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,030
Hurry and climb up.

554
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,139
Use some force and come up here.

555
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,710
Don't pull me anymore.

556
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,469
I can't move.

557
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,420
The lake is starting to freeze.

558
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,909
Leave and never mind me.

559
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,790
Go and find help.

560
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,350
No.

561
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,790
I can't.

562
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,110
I can't leave you here.

563
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,190
Si Yan,

564
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,270
I'm not afraid of cold.

565
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,550
I'm not afraid of death.

566
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,389
I'm just afraid of

567
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,030
not understanding you.

568
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,389
You saved me again and again,

569
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,110
but you ran away from me.

570
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,590
Si Yan,

571
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,630
I understand now.

572
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,750
Your Highness!

573
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,870
Where are you, Your Highness?

574
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,550
Over here!

575
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,830
Help is here.

576
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,380
Just hold up a bit longer.

577
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,910
I'll go to get them.

578
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,470
Where are you, Your Highness?

579
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,070
We are here!

580
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,870
Si Yan,

581
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,390
you're back.

582
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,750
Why?

583
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,670
Why did you do that?

584
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,540
I don't deserve everything you did for me.
