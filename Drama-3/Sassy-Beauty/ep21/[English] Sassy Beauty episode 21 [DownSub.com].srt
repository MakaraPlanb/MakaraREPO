1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,070
We're finally back!

3
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,790
Father.

4
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,380
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,230
I acted rashly

6
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,990
and almost got Yi killed.

7
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,070
I'll accept any punishment.

8
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,950
Father,

9
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,990
If Da hadn't deployed the troops in time,

10
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,060
the Northland's army wouldn't have retreated.

11
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,910
Rise.

12
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,110
Neither of you

13
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,190
let me down.

14
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,590
Bao didn't, either.

15
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,870
You've been helping me

16
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,510
review the memorials.

17
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,430
Thank you for saying this, father.

18
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,230
It's my pleasure

19
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
to help you share the responsibility.

20
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,630
I'm not a sentimental person.

21
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,630
I'll try not to upset you.

22
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,910
Father,

23
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,910
you may not know this.

24
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,380
We solved the case
of the missing provisions

25
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,990
and saved our soldiers,

26
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,710
thanks to Xiu's help
from within the East City.

27
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,590
Xiu, you've finally behaved like a prince,

28
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,680
but you still have a long way to go

29
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,910
and work hard.

30
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,550
Not a big deal.

31
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,630
Since the King of Northland

32
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,110
has realized
what princes of the East City can do,

33
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,950
I guess he dares not start any war
in the next ten years.

34
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,710
You should be awarded.

35
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,740
Thank you, father.

36
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,950
The King of East City,
let's see how many good days you've left!

37
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,110
The person behind is watching you.

38
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,510
I'll see how you'll react

39
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,950
when you lose your son.

40
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,430
What did you say?

41
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,909
I mean...

42
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,190
I'll wait till I have my own son!

43
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,780
The King of East City has sons.

44
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,550
I can have many sons as well!

45
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,670
Honey,

46
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,030
what are you waiting for then?

47
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,590
Shall we?

48
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,390
Hua Yan?

49
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,950
Hua Yan.

50
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,590
Hua Yan.

51
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,659
Hua Yan!

52
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,390
Dismissed.

53
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,150
His Majesty

54
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,750
gave his sword to Prince Da.

55
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,110
Obviously, His Majesty thinks highly of him.

56
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,790
But the jade crown given to Prince Yi

57
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,790
can only be worn by the crowned prince.

58
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,660
Isn't it

59
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,340
obvious?

60
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,630
In my opinion,

61
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,710
the crowned prince

62
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,630
should be Prince Yi.

63
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,750
I agree.

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,910
I totally agree.

65
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,550
Congratulations, Si Yan.

66
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,870
It's so beautiful.

67
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,390
I'm really jealous.

68
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,790
Look!

69
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,909
It really suits you.

70
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,350
No more showing off.

71
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,060
I will soon catch up with you.

72
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,430
Let's wait and see.

73
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,550
Here is the order from the First Lady.

74
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,430
The Meditation Chamber
is looking for a makeup maid.

75
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,910
I'll let Si Yan take the job for now.

76
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,870
Why me?

77
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,150
You want me to be Tong Rui's maid?

78
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,030
That's impossible!

79
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,750
No way!

80
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,390
The Beekeeping Site is quite busy today.

81
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,860
They're in short of hands.

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,870
Why not...

83
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,990
Si Yan...

84
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,590
Well, it's not a hard no.

85
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,670
Fine.

86
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,350
Serving people

87
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,150
is exactly my strength.

88
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:44,830
You're here.

89
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,150
Miss Min,

90
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,190
how can I help you?

91
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,390
We're fine for now.

92
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,350
By the way,

93
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,750
father recently sent several pigs

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,940
from the Northland.

95
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,790
They didn't eat much these days.

96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,910
I wonder if you can help me find

97
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,150
delicious pig feed.

98
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,790
This is what you're good at, right?

99
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,830
You...

100
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,870
you're messing with me on purpose!

101
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,710
Didn't we agree that

102
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,670
we never disturb each other

103
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,510
and play our game separately?

104
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,150
I've told you that

105
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,150
I just wanted a makeup maid.

106
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,070
Although your makeup skills
are just average,

107
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,230
you're at least better them.

108
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,470
My god, I almost believed you.

109
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,590
You want me to be your makeup maid?

110
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,710
Just say it out loud
if you think I've improved.

111
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,990
Why hide it?

112
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,150
Glasses.

113
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,060
Don't call me Glasses!

114
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,430
Didn't you ask me to feed pigs first?

115
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:36,950
Tell me,

116
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,110
what are you planning now?

117
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,750
What's your final task?

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,670
Isn't it boring if I just tell you?

119
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,950
Why not

120
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,230
have a guess?

121
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,780
It's getting late.

122
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,750
Go to Prince Yi's palace

123
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,790
and invite him to come here tomorrow.

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,270
What do you want?

125
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,790
You're my maid now.

126
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,110
Just follow my order.

127
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,630
Why bother to ask?

128
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,350
You're apparently ordering me about

129
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,070
for personal reasons.

130
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,550
I'm following the story setting.

131
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,990
Now, go!

132
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,510
It has been the third time already.

133
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,380
Indeed.

134
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,470
Look at this.

135
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,910
What General Min sent here

136
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,070
is clearly the dowry.

137
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,750
Dowry?

138
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,350
Whose dowry?

139
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,630
Can Tong Rui be sure that

140
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,669
she will marry Qi Yi?

141
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,230
It hasn't been decided.

142
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:37,870
He's speaking nonsense.

143
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,309
Don't worry about it.

144
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,870
His Highness won the battle

145
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,830
and was rewarded with the jade crown.

146
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,549
Of course, people want to flatter him.

147
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,430
It will be too late

148
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,390
after he becomes the crowned prince.

149
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,220
He went to the Patrol Squadron.

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,030
Do you want to see him?

151
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,630
Not me.

152
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,630
Our wealthy Miss Min wants to see him.

153
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,310
She asked Qi Yi to meet her
in the Meditation Chamber tomorrow.

154
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,870
I just don't understand it.

155
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,070
They live near each other.

156
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,510
Why let me send the message?

157
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,790
Can't she just knock on the wall?

158
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,150
His Highness is in trouble again.

159
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,430
Your Highness.

160
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,510
Where are Commandant Zuo and Minister Liu?

161
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,860
Didn't they say

162
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,830
they want to compete with me while I'm back?

163
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,750
They're ungrateful.

164
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,670
They all went to Prince Yi's palace.

165
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,470
I also heard that...

166
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,950
What?

167
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,740
General Min also went there himself

168
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,070
and brought gifts for Prince Yi.

169
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:32,950
Your Highness,

170
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,670
does it mean that

171
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,990
we no longer have a chance?

172
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,630
Xiu,

173
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,830
Manager Ruan was caught.

174
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,790
Let's go! Make good use of your strength

175
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,950
and interrogate him.

176
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,110
I asked you to load the provisions.

177
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,190
There's no time for this nonsense!

178
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,670
Move!

179
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,190
I...

180
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,830
I know nothing.

181
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,070
I see.

182
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,070
So this time

183
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,190
we won't ask you anything.

184
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,990
We'll wait.

185
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,190
Wait for what?

186
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,590
You're bluffing.

187
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,590
If you do know something,

188
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,030
you won't be wasting your time here.

189
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,310
You're right.

190
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm just a servant.

191
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,910
Observing other's speech and behavior

192
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,550
is just a basic skill.

193
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,470
Such a good servant!

194
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,070
Let's see if your master

195
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,030
deserves your loyalty.

196
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,070
Long!

197
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,830
Dad!

198
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,990
Grandpa, grandma,

199
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,900
and mom all died!

200
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,750
What did you say?

201
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,350
Don't cry!

202
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,630
They were killed by the man in black.

203
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,150
It was too late

204
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,590
when I arrived.

205
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,750
He promised not to hurt my family!

206
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,950
Can you tell me now?

207
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,510
Ten years ago,

208
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,750
I was just an assistant in the grain depot.

209
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,470
They found me

210
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,310
and promised me that

211
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,670
I could be the next manager

212
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,430
if I did what they asked.

213
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,070
We were having a locust attack at that time.

214
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,950
Victims were everywhere.

215
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,830
I worked in the provisions depot
at that time.

216
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,910
Our manager was a sympathetic man,

217
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,350
a great leader.

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,750
So I suggested that

219
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,820
we give victims

220
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,910
expired army provisions.

221
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,070
He asked me to write a report

222
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,220
and sent to the Court for approval.

223
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,670
However,

224
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,910
I changed the report

225
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,830
and accused him of taking army provisions

226
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,110
to line his pocket.

227
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,510
That's why many soldiers died

228
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,710
in the battle against the Northland

229
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,390
and we were defeated.

230
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,070
Is the previous manager you mentioned

231
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,340
Lin Xu, or Manager Lin,

232
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,870
who was later put to death?

233
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,110
Yes.

234
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,580
Si Yan,

235
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,230
the seventh daughter

236
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,790
of Manager Lin of Army Depot.

237
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,350
Your father was put to death
for embezzlement of provisions.

238
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,990
You are a criminal's daughter

239
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,430
and you work as a maid in the East Mansion.

240
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,710
What on earth do you want?

241
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,350
They really made you the next manager.

242
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,590
What happened next?

243
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,590
At first,

244
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,230
I was on tenterhooks,

245
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,230
but they never contacted me again.

246
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,220
When did you start to

247
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,750
transfer army provisions to the Northland?

248
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,630
Around...

249
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,110
three years ago.

250
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,830
They contacted me

251
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,110
once in a while.

252
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,510
Then,

253
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,230
the provisions were secretly transferred

254
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
to the Northland

255
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,510
through foreign merchants' caravans.

256
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,110
There was nothing left

257
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,510
in the army depot.

258
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,140
I couldn't think of any solution

259
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,660
but let the boats overturn,

260
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,790
hoping that no one would find out.

261
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,110
How do you get in touch?

262
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,150
They sent a spy to reach me.

263
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,470
Then,

264
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,870
we would meet at the Treasure Store
on the edge city.

265
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,190
Treasure Store?

266
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,710
Who's there?

267
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,830
It's me.

268
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,310
What do you want me to do?

269
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,190
Are you suspecting that

270
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,790
they are part of a team?

271
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,830
Director Li was smuggling mica crystals.

272
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,750
Look at the ledgers Si Yan found.

273
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,340
These mica crystals

274
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,790
were sent to Treasure Store

275
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,830
in exchange for metals and jades.

276
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,540
It is worth

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,750
several grand every month.

278
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,390
These amounts of money

279
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,910
somehow ended up
being in the Treasure Store again.

280
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,540
So the Treasure Store
is an underground bank.

281
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,190
I sent people
to investigate it a long time ago.

282
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,510
All these years,

283
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,910
the Treasure Store is the only place

284
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,350
that does business with foreign merchants

285
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,470
in the name of
developing trade with the Northland.

286
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,830
So the army provisions

287
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,110
were also transferred
through the Treasure Store.

288
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,540
You once mentioned that

289
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,270
Manager Xue from the Treasure Store

290
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,030
used to serve under General Min.

291
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,910
I suspect that

292
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,350
the Treasure Store

293
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,350
is Min's secret outpost here.

294
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,230
Yi,

295
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,630
do you mean that

296
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,620
General Min is involved with all of these?

297
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,710
Ten years ago,

298
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,590
when our army was trapped in Northland
due to short of provisions,

299
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,750
the Min family's army arrived

300
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,950
and defeated the enemy.

301
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,830
Father bestowed him
the title of Zhenyuan.

302
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,580
After that, the Northland attacked us

303
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,310
once in a while.

304
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,630
General Min happened to
win all the battles.

305
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,030
Normally speaking,

306
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,790
the Northland would have

307
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,870
took our people's money and food

308
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,790
and had conflicts all the time

309
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,790
since they never won once.

310
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,430
However, they didn't do anything.

311
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,070
From what General Min's report said,

312
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,990
we almost lost nothing.

313
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,310
It seemed that

314
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,790
the two of us were just acting.

315
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,270
It's quite possible that

316
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,910
General Min gave
the Northland money and food

317
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,860
to make sure that nobody could replace him.

318
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,350
That's shameless.

319
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,710
He has been fighting for years!

320
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,030
All these years,

321
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,030
father has a good reason

322
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,750
to show his respect

323
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,830
and has feared for him.

324
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,910
That's why we need reliable evidence.

325
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,390
Ask Yun Li to keep an eye on the store.

326
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,550
Go visit the Meditation Chamber these days.

327
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,990
Don't worry about Si Yan getting jealous.

328
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,670
If Min Tongrui knows

329
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,630
what General Min did,

330
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,510
then she is a threat to us

331
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,910
if she stays in the East Mansion.

332
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,310
Your Highness,

333
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,710
this is the special hair growth cream
from the west.

334
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,630
Have a try.

335
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,670
This is good for your health.

336
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,230
Here you are.

337
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,470
I can't even have it with hawthorn cake.

338
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,590
I prefer this.

339
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,270
Your Highness,

340
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,550
you lost five more hairs

341
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,830
this morning.

342
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,830
Please take the medicine.

343
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,070
I'm busy.

344
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
You don't know what I saw.

345
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,510
The King's hair

346
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,750
dropped like this.

347
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,470
After he took off the wig,

348
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,670
he actually had no single hair left.

349
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,910
It's so scary.

350
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,310
Does the whole family have hair issues?

351
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,270
The new hair growth recipe

352
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,829
made by the Institute of Medicine

353
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,700
is too smelly.

354
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,069
No one likes it.

355
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,670
Doctors have no solution

356
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,590
and ask if others can come up with
some medicine pairings.

357
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,190
Of course,

358
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,430
the Makeup Service has to show our support.

359
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,430
We have never made

360
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,940
anything like this before.

361
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,270
I'd like to give it a try

362
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,430
on one condition.

363
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,150
If I win,

364
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,950
please transfer me back to the Service.

365
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,150
If you can solve this problem,

366
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,310
I will speak for you

367
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,140
in front of the First Lady.

368
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,980
Deal!

369
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,630
What exactly do we need to make?

370
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,870
Si Yan,

371
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,030
you don't even know what's going on.

372
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,630
How can you just take on the work?

373
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,630
It's still about making makeup products.

374
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,590
Just tell me,

375
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,990
is it hairline powder

376
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,990
or a healthy hair comb?

377
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,190
Neither.

378
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,430
It's...

379
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,230
delicious medicine parings.

380
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,420
Why are you here?

381
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,350
Are you worried about me?

382
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,670
You even bring me gifts.

383
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,430
Yi,

384
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,870
you're here.

385
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,590
Si Yan,

386
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,470
make some tea.

387
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,630
These are...

388
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,910
His Highness was busy with
Patrol Squadron's work

389
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,070
and didn't have time to visit Miss Min.

390
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,070
That's why we bring gifts here.

391
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,950
Fine.

392
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,150
I'll make some tea,

393
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,110
Miss Min.

394
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,750
Yi,

395
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,470
shall we go inside and play chess?

396
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,750
I...

397
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,630
I need to ask you a favor.

398
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,270
If Min Tongrui knows

399
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,910
what General Min did,

400
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,070
then she is a threat to us

401
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,550
if she stays in the East Mansion.

402
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,630
Sounds good.

403
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,030
Let's go.

404
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,950
Prince Yi really cares about Miss Min.

405
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,750
He brought so many gifts

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,790
for everyone here.

407
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,630
That's how wealthy people
treat their true love.

408
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,110
Miss Min is lucky.

409
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,710
Those two

410
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,430
are like a dragon and a phoenix.

411
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,190
They will be a happy couple.

412
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,070
Dragon and phoenix?

413
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,390
They're two-timing

414
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,030
cheaters!

415
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,670
I think they're a perfect match.

416
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,310
You only have food in your mind!

417
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,270
I keep meeting you in the kitchen

418
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,790
since you're able to touch the food!

419
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,790
He's so handsome!

420
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,630
So tall!

421
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,100
His eyes are so bright!

422
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,270
You are already

423
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,710
as popular as those princes.

424
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,990
I can't imagine how many girls here

425
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,310
have fallen in love with you?

426
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,750
Are you one of them?

427
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,470
I need to leave.

428
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,230
No need to look there.

429
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,110
Si Yan is not here.

430
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,230
How's it going with General Min?

431
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,110
Although the Northland retreated,

432
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,350
we are not sure

433
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,700
if they will come back again.

434
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm worried that General Min
might let his guard down

435
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,460
and give our enemy a chance to attack us.

436
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,310
Don't worry.

437
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,750
Father has been
guarding the border for years

438
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,550
and he never leaves the Northland.

439
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,630
The King of Northland fears him.

440
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,990
This time,

441
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,550
father took the Redbud Pass back

442
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,710
without losing any soldiers.

443
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,710
The Northland will get nothing good

444
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,110
if they ever start the war again.

445
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,910
If they have enough food and money supply,

446
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,430
why would they be afraid of losing?

447
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,350
After all,

448
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,630
the Redbud Pass

449
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,990
is not the only thing that protects them.

450
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,070
You mean...

451
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,190
there are other people

452
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,830
who can benefit from the war.

453
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,830
Checkmate.

454
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,590
So you already had a suspect.

455
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,110
I don't know what to say

456
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,700
to dispel your doubt,

457
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,470
but my father

458
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,110
thought highly of a person.

459
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,790
Who?

460
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,230
Qi Teng.

461
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,150
Father respected him

462
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,390
and felt sorry for his death.

463
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,230
But Father knew that

464
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,910
Qi Teng would die on the battlefield.

465
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,510
Enough.

466
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,670
Father used to tell me that,

467
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,750
as a soldier who guarded the border,

468
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,590
no matter what position he was at,

469
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,830
he should die on the battlefield

470
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,910
to defend every inch of our territory.

471
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,940
You should have a face-to-face talk

472
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,910
with someone who said things like this,

473
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,510
or you may wrong an innocent person

474
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,470
and cause unnecessary trouble.

475
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,460
Don't let the real criminal
get away with it.

476
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,510
Miss Min, you're smart.

477
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,870
I've learned my lesson.

478
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,590
Father will show up at our wedding.

479
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,830
Yi, you put this piece

480
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,430
at the wrong place,

481
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,950
as if you're bringing about
your own destruction.

482
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,070
Miss Min, you have excellent skills.

483
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,030
I lost.

484
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,510
It's late today.

485
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,430
I'll leave for now.

486
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,060
You're not waiting for Si Yan?

487
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,030
You brought so many gifts

488
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,430
to the Meditation Chamber.

489
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,670
Even the maids

490
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,910
working in the Meditation Chamber

491
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,070
can have their portions.

492
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,630
You're so generous.

493
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,460
I should thank you on behalf of them.

494
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,070
Or...

495
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,790
should I thank Si Yan?

496
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,310
Chestnut cakes from the south,

497
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,550
pomegranate flower bonsai,

498
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,350
and a full set of
limited edition lipsticks.

499
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,470
This one is even more amazing.

500
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,550
Golden and silver silk thread from Persia.

501
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,750
I have a question for you, Yi.

502
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,710
Do you want me
to make you a jumper with this?

503
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,220
You want to act friendly.

504
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,630
I totally understand it.

505
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,750
However,

506
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,860
at least show me your efforts next time.

507
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,870
I know you don't have feelings for me,

508
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,350
but please have some boundaries

509
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,510
and let me do what I should do.

510
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,590
I only want a title.

511
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
I dare not

512
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,190
ask for anything else.

513
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,990
Miss Min, I'm sorry.

514
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,990
I can promise you anything,

515
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,670
except for

516
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,190
our engagement.

517
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,430
Blockheaded.

518
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,910
Giving me gifts in such a way!

519
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,910
Well done!

520
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,150
Tell me,

521
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,630
what color jumper do you like?

522
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,550
I can make one for you.

523
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,550
I...

524
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,510
I need to go to the Patrol Squadron.

525
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,270
Okay.

526
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,670
I won't keep you any longer.

527
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,630
Be quick.

528
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,150
I'll see you

529
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,990
at the usual spot tonight.

530
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,350
Yi,

531
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,870
why are you resting in my place?

532
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,070
What?

533
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,110
Is there something in your mind?

534
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,870
Manager Lin

535
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,550
is Si Yan's father.

536
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,390
What?

537
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,910
Did she know what happened before?

538
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,870
Are you going to tell her?

539
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,790
I failed to stop Manager Lin

540
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,030
from being killed years ago.

541
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,270
Her family was ruined by me.

542
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,630
How dare a small manager

543
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,060
steal all the provisions from the depot?

544
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,950
Father,

545
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,230
as far as I know,

546
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,950
Maolin is experiencing
severe locust attacks.

547
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,230
Whether Manager Lin

548
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,270
used food to save people

549
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,630
or line his pockets

550
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,830
needs further investigation.

551
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,510
What?

552
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,950
Did anyone make you unhappy?

553
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,390
Brother was besieged by our enemies.

554
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,990
We lost many soldiers

555
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,390
due to the lack of food.

556
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,190
Please don't let these corrupt officials
easily get away with this.

557
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,630
What?

558
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,750
Rise.

559
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,750
If we don't kill

560
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,950
people like Manager Lin,

561
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,700
we won't be able to quell people's anger!

562
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,540
Father.

563
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,710
Take this.

564
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,430
Now

565
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,700
how could I face her?

566
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,350
You didn't know

567
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,750
that her father was framed.

568
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,270
I'm not sure
if I have the right to say this,

569
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,550
but it has been many years
since this happened.

570
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,030
Why mention it to her?

571
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,300
If you tell her the truth,

572
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,910
maybe she will be hurt again.

573
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,550
You two might have more understanding.

574
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,030
How do you get along?

575
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,190
If she is angry with you because of this,

576
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,910
you will end up hurting yourself.

577
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,350
Think more about it.

578
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,790
They're all spoiled.

579
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,150
Does the medicine taste this bad?

580
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,190
Just hold the nose and take it.

581
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,780
You're in the kitchen again.

582
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,190
Such good timing.

583
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,630
Give me some ideas.

584
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,750
Is there anything

585
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,470
I can cook

586
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,790
to make those virtual princes happy?

587
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,710
Let me think.

588
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,270
Shouldn't you add something sweet
to the medicine?

589
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,590
Well...

590
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,030
my mom would give me candy

591
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,910
when I was little.

592
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,750
Sweet and chewy candy.

593
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,510
description

594
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,870
makes me want to have a try.

595
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,630
Good idea!

596
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,790
I can make that.

597
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,470
It will blow their minds.

598
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,820
Jack,

599
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,870
you used to be a cook.

600
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,310
Help me, please.

601
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,270
But I'm an imperial bodyguard.

602
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm not allowed to leave.

603
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,670
I see you every day.

604
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,470
Can you just do me a favor?

605
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,430
We need some fruits.

606
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,270
Let's go!

607
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,070
Hurry!

608
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,470
Jack,

609
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,340
I won't try to figure out

610
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,430
whether you are Xiao Li or Jack.

611
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,270
We are the same

612
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,460
as we were before.

613
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,740
No.

614
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,190
It feels more real than before.

615
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,310
I can touch you now.

616
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,350
Actually,

617
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,830
you've always been by my side, right?

618
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,150
I didn't realize this earlier.

619
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,670
I didn't even say

620
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,790
thank you to you.

621
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,820
Don't leave me in the dark.

622
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,030
Don't leave me in the dark.

623
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,750
I can't see anything,

624
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,750
but I can give up everything

625
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,950
for you.

626
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,550
Si Yan,

627
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,070
I'm sorry.

628
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,630
I can't see anything.

629
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,270
Xiao Li, it's alright.

630
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,670
Don't be afraid. It all passed.

631
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,030
Si Yan.

632
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,140
Wake up.

633
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,590
Xiao Li, wake up.

634
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,190
Don't be afraid.

635
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,590
Si Yan.

636
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,950
Si Yan.

637
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,070
Si Yan.

638
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,310
Can you stay with me?

639
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,790
I need to do something.

640
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,340
I have to leave now.

641
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,670
Prince Da, what brings you here?

642
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,030
Your Highness!

643
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,670
Your Highness!

644
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,230
You can't go inside!

645
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,750
Out of my way!

646
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,750
Move!

647
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,700
Leave us alone.

648
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,110
Yes.

649
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,390
Your Highness broke into
my Meditation Chamber

650
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,590
under everyone's eyes.

651
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,910
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

652
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,030
You seem to be quite calm.

653
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,990
You came back days ago,

654
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,190
but you never visited me once.

655
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,230
Instead, you and Yi
got well along with each other

656
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,150
and had a lot of fun.

657
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,590
Tell me,

658
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,670
who am I to you?

659
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,990
Your Highness.

660
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,390
I've made it clear

661
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,950
with you.

662
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,180
I never forgot

663
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,790
what happened between us

664
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,070
while I was still Miss Tong.

665
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,550
But I'm Miss Min now.

666
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,150
I have no choice

667
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,590
but to follow

668
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,300
my destiny.

669
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,830
Your Highness.

670
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,830
Please behave yourself.

671
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,710
Tong Rui,

672
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,389
I'm begging you.

673
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,150
Please?

674
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,510
Your Highness,

675
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,270
do we have the ability

676
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,230
to make decisions for ourselves?

677
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,550
Fine.

678
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,179
Fine.

679
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,500
Miss Min,

680
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,030
the destiny you're talking about

681
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,470
is not decided yet.

682
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,470
No one knows

683
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,110
who will be the winner.

684
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,350
Your Highness,

685
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,230
what are you going to do?

686
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,390
What happened?

687
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,990
He never arrives late.

688
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,510
You're here!

689
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,790
What happened?

690
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,950
Are you drunk?

691
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,750
Si Yan,

692
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,900
I have something to tell you.

693
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,590
Why are you being weird?

694
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,390
We know each other so well.

695
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,590
You're drunk.

696
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,630
I'll get you home first.

697
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,510
In the end,

698
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,670
we can't force ourselves to be together.

699
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,870
I think we should end our relationship.

700
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,230
We didn't force it.

701
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,870
If we are forced to be together,

702
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,230
how can we make it till today?

703
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,700
What happened?

704
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,190
Is there anything getting in our way?

705
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,390
I don't want to break up with you.

706
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,270
It's too late, Si Yan.

707
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,100
We shouldn't have met

708
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,390
at the beginning.

709
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,470
I don't care

710
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,820
what happened.

711
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,510
Please don't push me away.

712
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,070
You don't know anything.

713
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,110
Many years ago,

714
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,510
Manager Lin,
who was in charge of the provisions,

715
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,910
was framed to death

716
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,630
because I didn't stop them from killing him.

717
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,350
That's why

718
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,020
the system

719
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,430
asked me to kill Qi Yi.

720
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,990
No truth should be kept as secret.

721
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,180
No good man should be wronged.

722
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,390
Si Yan,

723
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,310
you can blame me,

724
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,830
hate me,

725
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,310
or even kill me.

726
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,430
I won't complain.

727
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,390
But I'm afraid.

728
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,310
I don't know

729
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,950
how I should face you.

730
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,270
I can't even imagine

731
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,350
our future.

732
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,470
How can I force you to stay with me?

733
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,750
Thank you for being honest with me

734
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,350
and telling me

735
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,710
the deepest secret in your heart.

736
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,070
I've never seen a man

737
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,150
who can be as honest as you.

738
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,230
Qi Yi,

739
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,630
thank you for your courage.

740
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,190
Thank you for loving me.

741
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,310
I really don't blame you.

742
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,230
I mean it.

743
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,990
I believe that

744
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,350
you didn't know

745
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,750
my father was framed at that time.

746
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,150
That's why you didn't save him.

747
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,150
I know it's an accident.

748
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,110
I don't blame you.

749
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,980
I mean it.

750
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,670
I'll make sure

751
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,910
what you asked will be done.

752
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,270
Where are you from?

753
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,670
It's midnight.

754
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,550
Why are you hanging around?

755
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,750
My lord,

756
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,580
I just joined the Institute of Medicine.

757
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,110
I lost my way.

758
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,590
Please forgive me.

759
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,910
I'll leave now.

760
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,470
Jack didn't make the green one.

761
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,910
I'll do it then.

762
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,310
Where did you go?

763
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,030
Check this out.

764
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,590
I made this green gummy bear.

765
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,230
What do you think?

766
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,790
Green?

767
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,110
Didn't I just make it?

768
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,990
It's fine.

769
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,390
It's fine.

770
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,190
Please forget about

771
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,990
what I said before.

772
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,430
What did you say?

773
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,110
If you want to help me, then be quick.

774
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,190
It's almost dawn.

775
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,430
We'll be running out of time.

776
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,590
Si Yan,

777
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,990
did you finish the medicine paring?

778
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,260
The princes are waiting.

779
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,230
Someone!

780
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,910
Bring the medicine.

781
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,630
Wait.

782
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,230
This one is for Prince Yi.

783
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,310
One reason

784
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,420
you're here today is to

785
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,950
have some tea and chat with me.

786
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,620
Second,

787
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,470
it's time for the Institute of Medicine

788
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,710
to reveal the best dessert.

789
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,150
Mrs. Huang,

790
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,790
bring all the desserts here.

791
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,630
Let the princes have a try

792
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,790
and see if they go with medicine.

793
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,270
The person

794
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,750
whose desserts have been eaten most

795
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,070
will be the winner.

796
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,350
Royal Kitchen.

797
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,310
Dragon beard candy.

798
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,070
Garment Service.

799
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,550
Orange Cake.

800
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,550
Protocol Department.

801
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,590
Red preserves.

802
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,830
Makeup Service.

803
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,630
Spon...gummy bear?

804
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,270
Spongy.

805
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,660
Spongy gummy bear.

806
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,310
Si Yan

807
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,390
treats these princes like little kids.

808
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,190
This is so delicate.

809
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,380
Si Yan,

810
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,830
what's the flavor?

811
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,230
As for the flavor...

812
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,510
You have to

813
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,550
find out yourself.

814
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,990
I won't let you down.

815
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,710
The name is strange.

816
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,150
How can it taste good?

817
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,230
Da,

818
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,230
Si Yan made this herself.

819
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,950
Since you made this,

820
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,470
I'll save it for the last.

821
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,590
Where are you from?

822
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,030
It's midnight.

823
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,910
Why are you hanging around?

824
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,110
I'll leave now.

825
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,030
Check this out.

826
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,910
I made the green gummy bear.

827
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,110
Green?

828
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,380
Didn't I just make it?

829
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,910
What are you doing!

830
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:29,990
My mistake.

831
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,310
It's my fault.

832
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,270
I accidentally dropped them.

833
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:36,910
There are a few left.

834
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:37,510
I'll go get them.

835
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,110
It's fine.

836
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,270
No bother.

837
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,270
You can have mine.

838
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,990
Yi,

839
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,630
please ask Si Yan

840
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,790
to make more of them for us.

841
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,070
Since you had the candy,

842
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,190
finish the medicine then.

843
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,750
Maybe the gummy bear isn't the only poison.

844
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,230
The medicine could be poisonous as well!

845
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,150
Your Highness,

846
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,100
the medicine is cold.

847
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,070
It is bitter.

848
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,230
I'll get you a new one.

849
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,470
You are such a rash man.

850
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,150
You not only hit Prince Yi

851
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,150
but also caused trouble.

852
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,790
Why didn't you get others a new one?

853
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,910
Or is something wrong with the medicine?

854
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,790
What are you doing?

855
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,670
Put it down.

856
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,190
There is nothing wrong with the medicine.

857
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,510
I'll prepare new medicine for all princes.

858
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,070
Jack.

859
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,990
Jack,

860
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,510
are you alright?

861
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:50,900
Of course,

862
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,470
I'm alright.

863
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,110
They're waiting for you.

864
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:54,990
Go back.

865
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,070
Are you sure?

866
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,900
Don't worry.

867
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,030
I'm fine.

868
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:00,670
Go.

869
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,110
Si Yi.

870
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,550
I won't let anything happen to Qi Yi

871
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,990
and get you involved.

872
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,100
Jack,

873
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,390
this transparent one is for you.

874
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:38,820
Your Highness.

875
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,070
You are such a professional.

876
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,310
this UNIFON Purifying Clay Face Mask

877
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,110
gives you a deep cleanse
and purifies your skin.

878
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,070
It's just for the royal family's use

879
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:45,910
and it's a limited edition.

880
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,870
Take all of these

881
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,350
and send them to my palace.

882
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,310
Yes!
