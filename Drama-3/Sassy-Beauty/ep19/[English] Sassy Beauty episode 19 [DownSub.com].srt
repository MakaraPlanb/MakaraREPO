1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,350
Where's Miss Tong?

3
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,390
Where is she?

4
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,470
What did you do to her?

5
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,150
Walk!

6
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,790
Behave!

7
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,750
Where are you taking me?

8
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,340
She's fine.

9
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,310
And...

10
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,829
she's been very "cooperative."

11
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,390
I'll have you in exchange for your brother.

12
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,310
Qi Yi?

13
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,590
Why is he here?

14
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,790
This is all on me.

15
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,390
Let him go.

16
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
Let him go?

17
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,150
Miss Tong will be dead then.

18
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,630
You!

19
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,550
Qi Da,

20
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,830
to be a king

21
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,550
means that you can't have all you want.

22
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,020
Choice and sacrifice are necessary.

23
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,829
Victory belongs to those who are prepared.

24
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,670
But you are just pathetic.

25
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,310
You!

26
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,670
Don't be so naive next time,

27
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,150
Qi Da.

28
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,390
Let him go.

29
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,710
Prince Yi,

30
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,990
I haven't seen you in a while.

31
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,590
It seems that there are many misunderstandings

32
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,909
between you and me.

33
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,230
What happened three years ago 
has nothing to do with me.

34
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,390
What do you mean?

35
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,710
You will see it later.

36
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,830
Since Prince Yi has kept his promise,

37
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,390
I shall let him go.

38
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,350
Why are you doing this?

39
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,150
The army cannot be led without you.

40
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,430
If I was captured,

41
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,790
I believe you would've done the same for me.

42
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,750
Don't feel sorry about this.

43
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,630
I took what you cherished when we were young.

44
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,630
Let me give it back to you.

45
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,390
You've said that

46
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,190
this jade is transparent

47
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,590
and can bring good luck.

48
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,310
Does that black lotus

49
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,550
belong to Qi Yi?

50
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,630
Now I want to return it to you.

51
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,550
Yi,

52
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,230
take care.

53
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,500
Save it.

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,510
Off you go.

55
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,710
No time for small talk.

56
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,430
If you didn't fight with me

57
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,550
for the mung bean cakes,

58
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,510
Mother wouldn't have locked me up here.

59
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,870
Brother Da, I didn't mean to fight with you.

60
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,550
You are the child of the First Lady.

61
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,470
Everything is yours.

62
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,590
Get lost!

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,190
Brother Da, don't be mad at me.

64
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,630
I can give you this.

65
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,110
You can trade a lot of cakes for that.

66
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,350
It can also bring you good luck.

67
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,110
You filthy rat!

68
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,590
How dare you call me that!

69
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,870
As a man,

70
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,340
you don't even know how to fight.

71
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,380
All you can do is stab people from behind.

72
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,909
You don't deserve the throne.

73
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,750
Go back home and graze the sheep!

74
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,710
Your brother died because of me.

75
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,190
I suggest you stay low-key here.

76
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,710
Bring him down to the water dungeon.

77
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,870
Make him suffer!

78
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,670
Yes.

79
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,230
Walk.

80
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,710
Qi Yi,

81
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,070
why did you provoke the King of the Northland?

82
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,350
Yi,

83
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,510
I've marked the location of the secret passage

84
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,380
in the Zijin water dungeon for you.

85
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,100
Follow the mark and you shall find it.

86
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:39,789
Go!

87
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,550
Go.

88
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,950
Disrespectful as the Northland is,

89
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,820
they dare to threaten us with Yi's life

90
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,110
and ask for union through marriage.

91
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,190
When has the East City been humiliated like this?

92
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,510
The king of the Northland is so despicable

93
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,390
that he first took Prince Da as a hostage.

94
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,310
Then he took advantage of their brotherhood

95
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,990
and traded Prince Yi for Prince Da.

96
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,830
And now he's asking for lands and money.

97
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,190
He is absolutely

98
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,750
shameless!

99
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,270
What about we lead an army now

100
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,310
and take the Northland down?

101
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,550
Your Highness,

102
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,470
we must show the Northland

103
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,310
what we are capable of.

104
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,190
From my perspective,

105
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,310
we shouldn't rush at the moment.

106
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,030
The grain ships were overturned.

107
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,150
Brother Yi is captured.

108
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,590
There must be someone
 who's been pulling the strings behind.

109
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,390
We shall not fall for their tricks

110
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,830
and let someone reap over the fight.

111
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,030
I agree with Brother Xiu.

112
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,270
Besides, they have Brother Yi as a hostage.

113
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,230
Xiu is right.

114
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,870
We need to calm down,

115
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,350
especially at this moment.

116
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,030
I'd love to see

117
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
what other tricks

118
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,270
they have!

119
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,990
Father.

120
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,590
Your Majesty.

121
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,910
Are you alright?

122
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,580
Let's go on.

123
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,900
Ten years ago,

124
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,590
the Northland was nothing but a small village,

125
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,110
which was of little significance.

126
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,350
But somehow, over these years,

127
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,470
they've started to stir up trouble.

128
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,420
And now,

129
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,310
they even took Prince Yi hostage

130
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,660
to threaten His Majesty

131
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,870
and ask for Princess Hua Yan, his only daughter,

132
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,830
to marry to the Northland.

133
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,790
He must be aiming at

134
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,230
the five cities alongside as dowry.

135
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,580
But speaking of this Princess,

136
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,860
she's indeed mysterious.

137
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,310
Few people know what she looks like.

138
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,470
It is said that

139
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,670
the princess has been dead for years.

140
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,510
Dead?

141
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,990
It is also rumored that

142
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,950
her face is

143
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,420
breathtakingly beautiful.

144
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,350
Any man who sees her

145
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,670
would be

146
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,150
ravished by her beauty.

147
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,390
So, His Majesty

148
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,230
is reluctant to introduce her to the public.

149
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,430
But these are just rumors.

150
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,540
They could be lies.

151
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,190
Or they might be true.

152
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,630
Lady Qian has made the order.

153
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,990
All the mansions and pavilions

154
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,990
are selecting their candidates.

155
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,950
As for us,

156
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,590
I'll leave it for you to decide.

157
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,710
Why are you crying here?

158
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,110
To be adopted by Lady Qian

159
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,230
as her daughter

160
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,580
should be an honor for you.

161
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,870
She does not want a daughter!

162
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,630
She wants a scapegoat!

163
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,220
Weren't you very close to Prince Yi before?

164
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,830
Why are you so quiet now?

165
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,790
Si Yan!

166
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,670
Si Yan?

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,230
Will you?

168
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,550
I will.

169
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,990
Are you serious?

170
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,980
Lady Cui,

171
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,670
I won't regret it.

172
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,430
In our mansion,

173
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,870
you are the only one 
who's seen the Princess before.

174
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,750
Whether I could be selected by Lady Qian

175
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,510
is all on you.

176
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,390
What if you are selected?

177
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,830
After this,

178
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,470
can you make it to the Northland?

179
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,140
It must be very dangerous there.

180
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,510
I will do this

181
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,310
no matter what happens.

182
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,950
What's the point of

183
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,950
sticking around Prince Yi?

184
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,310
To get yourself into a mess again?

185
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,350
Now you don't even care about your own life.

186
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,710
I think you are brainwashed

187
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,750
by those love stories.

188
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,550
A Prince fall in love with a maid?

189
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,230
Nonsense!

190
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,990
Bravo.

191
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,230
I can tell that

192
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,590
you are not missing any of those love stories.

193
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,590
Are you jealous of me?

194
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,830
Why would I be jealous of

195
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,070
those unrealistic tales?

196
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,750
A couple that doesn't match

197
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,860
is destined to be doomed.

198
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,380
Even my makeup brush is more reliable than that.

199
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,350
You are right.

200
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,190
But just let me be.

201
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,750
You win.

202
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,070
Isn't it nice to stay at Makeup Service

203
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,710
and polish your skills?

204
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,190
Why do you have to suffer for this?

205
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,430
I enjoy it.

206
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,270
Love is love.

207
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,590
There are no limits.

208
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,310
If I love someone,

209
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,390
I don't care about status.

210
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,710
I shall go for it

211
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,910
even if we are in different dimensions.

212
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,430
You're so weird.

213
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,630
You're saying things that don't make sense again.

214
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,180
You're so annoying.

215
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:00,950
But

216
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,230
if there are more people

217
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,110
who think in the same way as you,

218
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,230
will that make a difference

219
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,310
to our situation?

220
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,670
Trust me.

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,950
That day will come.

222
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,950
I promise.

223
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,390
You're full of big talk.

224
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,070
You should take care of your life first.

225
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,150
Did the sun rise up from the west?

226
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,510
I didn't expect that even you

227
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,190
care about me.

228
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,030
Who cares?

229
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,990
I was hoping that 
you could leave soon as you can.

230
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,870
Prince Yi will be saved.

231
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,030
I will be at the top of Makeup Service.

232
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,390
Isn't that a win-win?

233
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,270
Okay, okay.

234
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,540
Then, please show me what you are capable of

235
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,710
and do me a favor.

236
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,070
No.

237
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,710
Why is that?

238
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,660
This cannot be done by makeup.

239
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,110
We need to find another way.

240
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,950
Am I not pretty enough?

241
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,870
Lady Qian,

242
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,910
these are the portraits of the selected maids.

243
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,030
These are all we have here.

244
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,150
Her eyes are not good.

245
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,150
This one looks unhappy.

246
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,510
This...

247
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,990
This one won't do, either.

248
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,830
My lady, what about this one?

249
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,990
Si Yi An?

250
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,230
She is the one!

251
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,910
Yes.

252
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,790
Prince Xiu,

253
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,790
these are what we salvaged from the sunken ships.

254
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,310
They are all rocks and cotton.

255
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,430
No grain is in there at all.

256
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,550
It seems that the accidents of

257
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,670
the granary and ships

258
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,670
could have been planned in advance.

259
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,550
Have you found the damn Manager Ruan?

260
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,990
The servants have been salvaging for days

261
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,470
and found nothing.

262
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,030
Probably he didn't get on the ship.

263
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,110
Being in the position of Cashier Service

264
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,990
can give him the courage to do such a thing.

265
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,020
Yun Li,

266
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,030
bring him to me,

267
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,550
no matter he's dead or alive.

268
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,550
Yes, Your Highness.

269
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,910
A despicable man like him

270
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,030
may lead an indulging life.

271
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,190
Go check Cloud Brothel.

272
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,980
You told me that

273
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,700
Yi made this incense

274
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,390
particularly for me.

275
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,790
You know what?

276
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,190
The smell of it

277
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,510
really makes me feel better

278
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,099
from head to toe.

279
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,300
The chest pain seems to be relieved.

280
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,069
Your Majesty,

281
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,790
set your mind at ease.

282
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,430
Prince Yi will be fine.

283
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,910
He will come back safely.

284
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,910
I hope so.

285
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,870
If I lose Yi,

286
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,190
to whom should I

287
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,270
pass on the throne?

288
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,750
Your Majesty,

289
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,030
I'll go check the medicine.

290
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,910
Mother.

291
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,430
You're back, Bao.

292
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,790
Does Father feel better now?

293
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,670
I've brought the medicine soon as it's done.

294
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,550
He's gone to bed.

295
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,710
You've been busy arranging all the stuff.

296
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,870
You must be tired.

297
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,070
I'm fine.

298
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,510
This is the least that I can do.

299
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,660
Director Hua.

300
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,830
Director Hua,

301
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,580
are these for my father?

302
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,700
These are the memorials to the King over the days.

303
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,940
Leave them to me.

304
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,550
I'll learn how to deal with these

305
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,230
and share Father's burdens.

306
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,590
Bao,

307
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,630
you can't make reckless decisions

308
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,150
when it comes to state affairs.

309
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,270
You need to strike a balance.

310
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,190
If there's anything you don't understand,

311
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,670
ask me any time.

312
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,990
I'll remember that by heart.

313
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,950
I'll go back then.

314
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,790
Leave.

315
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,390
It doesn't make sense.

316
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,380
The system is never wrong.

317
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,390
I took what you cherished when we were young.

318
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,350
I'll give it back to you.

319
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,950
It belongs to Qi Yi.

320
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,710
Greetings, Prince Da.

321
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
Come on, present the gifts.

322
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,670
Please.

323
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,470
The person with the white jade box

324
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,950
is the one I should be with.

325
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,470
I did everything right!

326
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,950
It was Prince Da who took the white jade box

327
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,230
to pick up Miss Min.

328
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,190
How are you, Brother Yi?

329
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,230
I am fine.

330
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,390
Please, Da, take care of Miss Min.

331
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,940
Since you can't go there,

332
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,820
I, as your big brother,

333
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,710
will go there for you.

334
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,910
So, the one I should be with

335
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,550
is not Qi Da,

336
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,180
but Qi Yi.

337
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,070
Cheers, guys!

338
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,950
Here's to our King!

339
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,790
Come on!

340
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,470
Down in one!

341
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,230
Your Majesty,

342
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,150
we're all dying to know

343
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,460
who is the person you're partnered with.

344
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,510
Is Qi Yi

345
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,950
really worth that much?

346
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,230
If my partner's identity is exposed,

347
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,350
not only you,

348
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,470
but each one of you here

349
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,030
will be astounded.

350
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,790
Just get ready to become rich!

351
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,630
Great!

352
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,990
Thank you, Your Majesty!

353
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,430
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

354
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,270
Let's drink!

355
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,060
Let me in!

356
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,300
Qi Yi is a hostage from the East City, after all.

357
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,350
Your Majesty, it's okay if you don't treat him
 with respect.

358
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,790
But do you have to torture him in the water dungeon?

359
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,670
You almost beat him to death.

360
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,070
If anything happens to him,

361
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,270
you'll never be able to

362
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,670
get those five cities you want.

363
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,270
I planned all this.

364
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,070
I will win this for sure.

365
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,310
He's just a prince.

366
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,830
Keeping him in the water dungeon

367
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,150
is already a nice treatment.

368
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,670
Don't worry!

369
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,830
I won't kill him.

370
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,630
I still need to use him to exchange for more things.

371
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,950
If you want to benefit from this,

372
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,830
stay by my side and behave.

373
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,940
Otherwise,

374
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,230
get lost.

375
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,310
Don't spoil my mood.

376
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,990
I am starting to miss my wolf again.

377
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,070
Why are you here?

378
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,350
Prince Yi,

379
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,710
there's no time to explain.

380
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,990
The wardens at the entrance have been bought.

381
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,230
I've got a horse ready outside the city.

382
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,230
Right now,

383
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,390
the King and his men are all drunk.

384
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,310
We need to run now!

385
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,990
Why would you, a lowly maid,

386
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,990
be here?

387
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,830
Your Highness...

388
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,060
The person standing right before me

389
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,420
should be General Min's only daughter.

390
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,310
Miss Min, you managed to persuade
 the King of the Northland

391
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,910
to take me as a hostage, instead of Brother Da,

392
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,100
and played us like fools.

393
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,590
When did you know?

394
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,390
The flowers are blooming.

395
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,340
The sun has risen

396
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,870
above the green branch.

397
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,230
Whose poem is this?

398
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,550
It's so poetic.

399
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,390
Brother Teng wrote it.

400
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,030
Miss Min, have you forgotten?

401
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,030
Why isn't your maid

402
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,710
with you today?

403
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,390
She was late

404
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,950
on the Flower Feast.

405
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,550
My lady,

406
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,110
where have you been?

407
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,310
I was scared to death!

408
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,310
Scared of what?

409
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,420
I am here, aren't I?

410
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,470
Miss Min, have you ever suspected that

411
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,350
it was she that tampered with the First Lady's rein?

412
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,150
Never mind.

413
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,270
I was just asking.

414
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,710
Because of the balsam flowers?

415
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,750
Indeed.

416
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,870
On the Flower Feast,

417
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,060
I gave Miss Min a potted balsam flower.

418
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,020
But she was allergic to balsam.

419
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,950
Brother Teng told me once

420
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,630
that balsam flowers were Miss Min's favorite.

421
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,030
So, you've known who I am since then.

422
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,070
Turns out I am such a lousy actor.

423
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,150
I just find it strange.

424
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,190
Why would you, the honorable Miss Min,

425
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,670
get involved with the Northland?

426
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,950
Why did you capture Brother Da for their King?

427
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,390
Back then,

428
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,310
I offended the King of Northland

429
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,510
because I killed his wolf.

430
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,310
So, he tied me up and took me here.

431
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,190
To save myself,

432
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,540
I had to take advantage of Prince Da.

433
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,420
Why did you hide your identity?

434
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,430
There are four princes in the East City.

435
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,710
If I didn't observe in secret,

436
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,750
how could I know

437
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,550
which one of you is capable of ruling the city

438
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,870
and becoming my husband?

439
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,100
Anyway,

440
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,590
let's leave here first.

441
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,550
The King of Northland is greedy and dishonest.

442
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,830
We need to figure out

443
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,180
if he's a friend or a foe.

444
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,430
Why should I trust you?

445
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,310
So, you displeased the King on purpose

446
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,590
so that he could throw you in here.

447
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,790
Turns out I underestimated you.

448
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,670
Qi Yi,

449
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,510
if it wasn't me who's standing here...

450
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:44,910
Your Highness,

451
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,390
you'd be in grave danger.

452
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,510
You must have your reasons

453
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,340
for saving me.

454
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,830
We'll get out of here for sure.

455
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,510
But as for how,

456
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,030
you need to do as I say.

457
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,270
Fine.

458
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,430
The Redbud Pass

459
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,300
is not simply easy to defend and hard to attack.

460
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,070
Back then, Brother Teng laid siege to it
 for seven days

461
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,430
and still couldn't break in.

462
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,510
However,

463
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,460
there is a secret passage

464
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,430
to the military camp of the Northland

465
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,660
for the delivery of provisions and soldiers.

466
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,550
So, you came to the water dungeon

467
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,550
to find the passage.

468
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,190
Brother Teng almost found it back then.

469
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,790
He should've won the battle at Redbud Pass.

470
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,350
But he died in an accident.

471
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,390
I will take advantage of this opportunity

472
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,230
to find the secret passage.

473
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,950
We need to send troops to the passage

474
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,950
on the wedding night

475
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,590
and take Redbud Pass.

476
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,670
I finally understood

477
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,270
why Si Yan took a fancy to you.

478
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,190
Your Highness,

479
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,110
you should put on the veil,

480
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,630
in case someone finds out the substitution

481
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,910
and report it to Lady Qian.

482
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,510
Who is it?

483
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,470
It's me.

484
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,590
Princess Hua Yan?

485
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,510
I want to marry to the Northland myself.

486
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,430
Yourself?

487
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,470
It's not necessary.

488
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,630
The Northland is in the middle of nowhere.

489
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,590
The sun is scorching there.

490
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,830
You're too delicate

491
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,670
to handle that.

492
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,670
I'll go there for you.

493
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,870
What?

494
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,190
Do you really think of yourself as the princess?

495
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,830
Will you help me or not?

496
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,910
Will you?

497
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,390
I will!

498
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,310
I will, okay?

499
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,390
Will this work?

500
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,590
It sure will.

501
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,950
Really?

502
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,630
Sorry.

503
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,190
I went too hard.

504
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,340
So what if they report it?

505
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,580
Even if Mother sent someone,

506
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,270
it would be too late already.

507
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,950
It was all thanks to you last night.

508
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,190
Otherwise,

509
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,190
I'd still be locked up in my room now.

510
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,550
Your Highness,

511
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,710
thank you for not blaming me.

512
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,550
You're helping me earn my freedom.

513
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,990
Why would I blame you?

514
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,630
However,

515
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,670
you're going to the Northland

516
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,510
for Brother Yi, right?

517
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,150
Although I don't show myself frequently,

518
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,230
I do know well about

519
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,830
the gossip in the Mansion.

520
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,750
I've learned roughly what happened

521
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,310
between you and Brother Yi.

522
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,630
Where are you right now?

523
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,350
Have you held hands yet?

524
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,870
Have you kissed?

525
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,430
Stop it!

526
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,990
Why are you so shy?

527
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,310
You've done everything

528
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,710
other than...the final step, right?

529
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,870
Come on, Your Highness, stop teasing me!

530
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,790
Don't be shy!

531
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,670
He's so handsome!

532
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,150
Look!

533
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,590
Who?

534
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,590
Where?

535
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,430
He looks familiar.

536
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,700
A tea merchant?

537
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,190
But he's carrying a bag of grain.

538
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,110
Clean this up now!

539
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,590
Clean this up!

540
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,110
Hurry!

541
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,030
Are the lost provisions of the East City

542
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,710
hidden in here?

543
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,030
Your Highness!

544
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,230
Come here.

545
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,830
Come here.

546
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,780
Are you also here

547
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,750
to check on the handsome...

548
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,230
Yes.

549
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,950
These foreign merchants seem fishy.

550
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,870
They're tea merchants

551
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,910
but they were loading grain to the containers.

552
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,700
A batch of grain was lost in the East City

553
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,830
and there's a batch of grain showing up here.

554
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,590
This whole thing is strange.

555
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,350
So, I came here to investigate it.

556
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,110
I didn't expect you to notice this, too.

557
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,590
Yeah.

558
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,350
You're right.

559
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,940
We're like-minded.

560
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,350
I am flattered.

561
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,550
What shall we do?

562
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,870
You...

563
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,020
Who are you?

564
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,350
Jack!

565
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:27,990
Jack!

566
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,230
You're Jack, right?

567
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,270
It's me, Si Yan!

568
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,310
Don't you recognize me?

569
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,860
It really is you!

570
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,540
You're finally back!

571
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,470
Who on earth are you?

572
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,100
Do you even know me?

573
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,230
Tell her to let go of me!

574
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,550
Let go of him!

575
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,150
Apparently, you're the person

576
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,990
that cares about me the most in the world.

577
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,270
Miss Si Yan,

578
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,180
it's my job to care about you.

579
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,670
I am moved.

580
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,710
Thank you.

581
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,340
It's true that I can't touch you!

582
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,950
I forgot that you can't eat it.

583
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,550
Miss Si Yan,

584
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,670
call a time-out.

585
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,870
Please!

586
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,990
Call a time-out!

587
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,150
I can touch you now!

588
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,700
I can finally touch you, Jack!

589
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,220
You've turned into a real person!

590
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,630
You know this handsome man?

591
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,630
That's great!

592
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,150
I've never seen a chef

593
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,989
this handsome before!

594
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,830
Let's talk!

595
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,630
Don't get handsy!

596
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,190
Your Highness,

597
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,870
can you really see him?

598
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,190
Not only can I see him,

599
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,820
but I can also touch him and feel him!

600
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,350
You...

601
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,110
Sorry,

602
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,699
I went too hard.

603
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,310
Why did you hit him so hard?

604
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,030
Well...

605
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,389
He seemed tough.

606
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,510
Who'd have known that he's so weak?

607
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,310
However...

608
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,270
Do you really know him?

609
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,150
I am not sure.

610
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,030
But there's no time for us to think about this.

611
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,630
There must be something wrong with the caravan.

612
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,389
We can't let them leave like that.

613
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,270
I'll send a homing pigeon to Brother Da

614
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,550
and ask him to send people

615
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,790
to take the grain back.

616
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,350
You also feel hopeless, right?

617
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,910
I wish I could

618
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,430
go to the frontline now

619
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,190
and bring Brother Yi back.

620
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,950
Mother.

621
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,470
How's it going?

622
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,630
I am not smart enough.

623
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,900
There are a lot of things I haven't figured out.

624
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,630
Sit.

625
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,150
Take your time.

626
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,070
Nobody is born to

627
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,310
know everything.

628
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,900
The key is to master these thoroughly

629
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,190
and take advantage of them.

630
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,910
What are your thoughts about

631
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,870
the overturned grain boats?

632
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,340
Brother Xiu found stones and cotton

633
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,350
in the bags they managed to salvage.

634
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,190
It means that

635
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,950
it was a man-made incident.

636
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,990
Manager Ruan alone

637
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,790
wasn't able to swap the provisions

638
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,830
without raising attention.

639
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,990
So, there must be someone else

640
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,190
behind this.

641
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,670
Someone else?

642
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,190
Who benefits the most from all this?

643
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,830
On the surface, it's the Northland.

644
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,470
But we haven't gotten to the bottom of this.

645
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,710
So, everything remains unclear.

646
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,750
Bao, you've gotten better at this.

647
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,470
You learned to analyze the pros and cons.

648
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,150
Wars

649
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,350
are bound to be cruel.

650
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,230
Over the years,

651
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,900
His Majesty has been giving us what we want.

652
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,430
He's been good to us.

653
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,830
It's all because the Min family
 has been guarding the border,

654
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,150
which is the key to defending ourselves
 against the Northland.

655
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,700
Think about it.

656
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,470
If the Northland

657
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,470
is no longer a threat to the East City,

658
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,870
then the Min family,

659
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,790
and us two...

660
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,670
How can we protect ourselves anymore?

661
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,110
Mother,

662
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,070
Brother Da and Brother Yi...

663
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,590
Bao,

664
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,710
have some soup while it's hot.

665
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,230
To make sure you can concentrate on the memorials,

666
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,390
I've demolished the hamster house.

667
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,830
Bao,

668
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,430
you won't hate me for it, will you?

669
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,190
I...

670
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,990
I understand why you did it, Mother.

671
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,990
They've got the same eyes

672
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,670
and nose.

673
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,270
Clearly, you are Jack!

674
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,470
Why do you pretend that you don't know me?

675
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,870
Jack!

676
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,630
Stop calling me Jack!

677
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,910
I am just a chef.

678
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,590
Stop acting!

679
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,110
There's no one else here.

680
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,630
Tell me!

681
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,990
Why did you disappear out of the blue?

682
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,870
Why did you come back as a chef?

683
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,510
Why can I touch you now?

684
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,270
Couldn't I be touched before?

685
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,460
What was I, then?

686
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,350
A ghost?

687
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,350
Or an imaginary person?

688
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,190
You used to be my AI Butler.

689
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,070
Although, it may sound

690
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,550
funny right now.

691
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,670
Jack is your butler.

692
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,870
I am just a chef.

693
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,630
How could you be a chef?

694
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,950
I used to teach you how to eat food.

695
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,750
You're my AI butler who's got

696
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,710
no pulse, no conscience,

697
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,750
no organs,

698
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,310
and nags a lot.

699
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,550
Maybe it's you that has no pulse!

700
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,310
Well...

701
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,310
Have some congee first.

702
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,670
Did you make this for me?

703
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,750
Tastes good.
