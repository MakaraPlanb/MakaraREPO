00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,310
Open the book!

3
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,430
You're in for a good story today.

4
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,790
People say that on Prince Yi's wedding day,

5
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,350
the Second Lady slaughtered the city.

6
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,310
But alas! She's too calculating and overly cunning,

7
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,510
and in the end, she got nothing

8
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,510
and became a commoner

9
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,070
exiled to the north region.

10
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,260
This matter involved many.

11
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,350
Prince Da

12
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,780
and Min Tongrui

13
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,870
disappeared since that day.

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,590
No one knows where they are!

15
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,390
Among all princes, the most unfortunate

16
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,230
is Prince Xiu.

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,950
He kept

18
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,900
an ingrate by his side

19
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,630
who had stayed in East City for years

20
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,030
in search of the most poisonous recipe

21
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,380
of heartbreak grass.

22
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,390
The heartbreak grass recipe

23
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,150
disappeared with him.

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,070
No one knows how many

25
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,870
innocent lives will be lost.

26
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,020
Yun Li had nothing to do with the poison

27
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,630
that killed Manager Xue.

28
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,390
Why are you getting upset?

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,830
Where is he?

30
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,430
I sent him to get the flowers for the incense.

31
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,829
He won't be back for a while.

32
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,310
Xiu,

33
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,910
why are you playing dumb?

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,950
Let's say he has nothing to do 
with the death of Manager Xue.

35
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,390
What about the Yun family?

36
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,790
These years,

37
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,870
the Yuns have been searching
 for the heartbreak grass.

38
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,510
For the elixir,

39
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,590
the Yun brothers attempted to kill each other.

40
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,790
Yun Li's father died tragically.

41
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,950
He was such a heroic man!

42
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,829
Do you know why he left the recipe to me

43
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,460
before he died?

44
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,180
He had hoped

45
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,430
the extreme poison

46
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,829
would never appear in the world

47
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,910
to injure or kill people.

48
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,350
But look what you did?

49
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,980
You happened to keep the wolf pup

50
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,590
by you all the time.

51
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,790
Aren't you afraid that he'll set up a trap

52
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,830
by working with the force outside?

53
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,550
Father,

54
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,670
he's loyal to me.

55
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,390
He will never do that.

56
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,190
I have sent people out

57
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,590
to track the whereabouts of the Yuns secretly.

58
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,510
Once I found that

59
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,820
Yun Li is still in contact with the Yuns,

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,470
he can no longer stay.

61
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,709
Yun Li knows nothing

62
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,149
about this.

63
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,110
Are you sure he knows nothing?

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,390
Or are you defending him?

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,630
The precious stone lands its

66
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,659
innocent possessor in jail.

67
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,510
Xiu,

68
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,470
you are still young.

69
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,670
Karma and destiny intertwine amongst people.

70
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,030
You ought to reflect on it more thoroughly.

71
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,790
Prince Xiu,

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,430
take care.

73
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,510
I have to break my promise.

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,550
I can no longer stay by your side now.

75
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,590
Flowers blossom and wither endlessly.

76
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,710
Willows cycle through green and brown.

77
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,270
You play less music on the zither

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,340
when you have fewer bosom friends.

79
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,950
The pursuits of the past and now

80
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,110
are passing illusions soon forgotten.

81
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,230
Anyways,

82
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,310
in East Mansion,

83
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,110
some people left, and others stayed.

84
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,550
It's not like what it was before.

85
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,060
What happened to Prince Yi?

86
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,630
About Prince Yi,

87
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,940
I'll tell his story next time.

88
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,230
Butler Jack,

89
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,550
welcome back!

90
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,950
What is this?

91
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,220
The game world

92
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,430
is about to start the count down to destruction.

93
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,540
Isn't there any other way?

94
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,750
You know your mission.

95
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,540
No!

96
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,870
I can't do that.

97
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,070
I won't do anything to betray Si Yan.

98
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,550
Oh? Even if it means that she won't ever wake up?

99
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,470
It's her choice.

100
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,470
She chose to stay in this world

101
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,950
and be with her love.

102
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,510
Maybe there'll be a turning point.

103
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,190
The person you miss

104
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,470
is waiting for you at the posting station.

105
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,030
If you accept the command to kill Qi Yi,

106
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,390
the person by Si Yan's side

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,030
will be you.

108
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,110
Waiter,

109
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,710
has someone come for me?

110
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,780
He left.

111
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,190
He waited for a long time.

112
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,909
Who has to come

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,909
will come.

114
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,110
Who shouldn't come

115
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,230
will leave.

116
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,870
You don't understand.

117
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,910
When I needed him,

118
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,390
he always appeared at lightning speed.

119
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,110
You are talking about God.

120
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,150
We normal people can't see Him.

121
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,070
You're right.

122
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,100
In the past,

123
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,910
I was the only person in this world who could see him.

124
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,550
Jack,

125
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,710
I wasn't able to bid my farewell to you.

126
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,660
You won't blame me, will you?

127
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,630
Miss Si Yan,

128
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,230
I would never blame you.

129
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,030
I know you had waited for me for a long time.

130
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,030
It's my fault.

131
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,390
Although I don't know where you're going...

132
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,110
Where will I be?

133
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,430
I'll leave it to fate.

134
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,510
Actually,

135
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,150
without you,

136
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,830
black and white are just adjectives.

137
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,870
Butler Jack,

138
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,790
you know clearly what the punishment is

139
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,710
by disobeying the order from the system.

140
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,750
Now

141
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,510
you don't have any choice.

142
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,790
Isn't it silence and endless darkness?

143
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,870
I can handle it.

144
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,990
Even if you are not afraid 
of being recycled forever,

145
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,220
but player Si Yan

146
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,150
won't be able to see

147
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,630
and hear you.

148
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,710
Are you still willing?

149
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,950
I want to thank you.

150
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,110
You walked toward me from the light,

151
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,910
and you stayed by my side

152
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,750
quietly.

153
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,150
I want to thank you as well,

154
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,540
Miss Si Yan,

155
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,510
for taking me on

156
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,140
a boisterous journey.

157
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,310
Don't worry, Jack.

158
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,790
I'll take good care of myself.

159
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,500
Thank you for always being there for me.

160
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,190
Thank you for liking me!

161
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,390
How about you?

162
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,270
Of course, I like you, too.

163
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,910
I like you as

164
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,870
the most precious friend of all.

165
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,780
How wouldn't I understand

166
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,510
your love for Qi Yi?

167
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,030
You're probably complaining about me.

168
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,950
For me now,

169
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,380
I only wish to safe-keep those images
 of your happiness

170
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,510
when you laughed out loud,

171
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,830
when you are rambunctious,

172
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,990
and even those tears

173
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,790
when you loved and were loved.

174
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,990
Miss Si Yan,

175
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,910
I only blame myself for not being able to
 make you happier.

176
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,350
You have to remember me.

177
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,710
After all, you are an AI.

178
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,270
You'll live on much longer than I will.

179
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,430
You'll forget about me slowly and surely.

180
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,230
I promise you

181
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,830
that I'll keep you in my heart

182
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,060
like a picture.

183
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,710
Follow me.

184
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,150
Lady Cui wants to see you.

185
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,630
Isn't this way to the Makeup Service?

186
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,830
Lady Cui was in league with the Second Lady.

187
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,140
She has lost her place at Makeup Service.

188
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,550
Lady Cui.

189
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
The so-called makeup

190
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,260
emphasizes

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,270
cleanliness, harmony, freshness,

192
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,340
compliance, orderliness, smoothness, and integrity.

193
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,660
Cleanliness

194
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,270
means keeping the appearance neat,

195
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,070
not dirty, and not cluttered.

196
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,630
Harmony

197
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,750
means that makeup and the look become one.

198
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,670
The beauty of post-makeup is natural and innate.

199
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,460
Freshness

200
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,270
refers to making sure the makeup is not expired.

201
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,830
The colors are pure.

202
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,780
And you can't neglect to manage the makeup items.

203
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,510
Compliance

204
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,830
means to have patience and delicacy

205
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,990
when applying hair oil.

206
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,470
As for orderliness,

207
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,950
it means following the procedures step by step

208
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,900
when brushing the hair.

209
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,150
Regarding smoothness,

210
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,710
it means to level up and even out when brushing the hair.

211
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,310
And integrity

212
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,870
is the highest state of applying makeup.

213
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,110
It depends on your heart.

214
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,510
Palace Makeup Service

215
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,430
is now under your management.

216
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,670
Me?

217
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,340
Head Matron?

218
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,990
Why me?

219
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,150
I can tell that

220
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,390
you like it from the bottom of your heart.

221
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,190
Makeup

222
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,990
is aesthetic.

223
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,510
You want to please both yourself and others.

224
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,470
But what matters the most is

225
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,870
the heart.

226
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,910
Greetings, my lady.

227
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,430
How is Si Yan doing?

228
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,030
Lady Cui said that

229
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,670
Si Yan is talented.

230
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,550
Perhaps

231
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,180
it's her destiny

232
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,109
to become Head Matron

233
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,270
of Makeup Service.

234
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,310
She's close to being compatible with my Yi.

235
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,670
You mean...

236
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,550
Do you agree?

237
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,510
It hasn't been easy for Yi.

238
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,070
Because of me,

239
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,110
he's had a hard time

240
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,820
growing up.

241
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,710
In the past,

242
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,670
I always thought

243
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,350
I should make plans for him

244
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,060
and fight for something.

245
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,870
I never asked him

246
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,910
what he was thinking

247
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,750
or what he wanted.

248
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,870
I channeled my efforts

249
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,700
in the wrong place after all.

250
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,950
Come to think about it,

251
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,420
as a mother,

252
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,710
I have wronged him.

253
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,270
My lady,

254
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,190
everything is going well now.

255
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,630
Shouldn't you be happy?

256
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,910
Happy?

257
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,390
I am happy.

258
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,740
Is it beautiful here?

259
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,110
Yes, it is.

260
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,830
Si Yan,

261
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,750
I can finally marry you.

262
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,550
Are you...

263
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,510
are you proposing to me?

264
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,550
Then my wedding has to...

265
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,510
I'll give you

266
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,990
the most magnificent wedding in East City.

267
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,390
That would be too much.

268
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,060
Then what do you want to do?

269
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,990
I also have a surprise for you.

270
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,590
Let's go.

271
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,820
Qi Yi,

272
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,060
are you crazy?

273
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,470
It's okay.

274
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,860
What's to worry about?

275
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,590
Wait for me!

276
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,750
Master, I can't hold them any longer.

277
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,910
You're not even holding much stuff.

278
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,750
You're not as strong as you look.

279
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,510
That's wrong.

280
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,310
You don't

281
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,990
even look strong.

282
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,190
And you're even weaker than you look.

283
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,350
I am holding these fabrics for you.

284
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,380
Why don't you hold it?

285
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,070
Just tell me if you need more clothing.

286
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,350
Why did we come here?

287
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,710
This place

288
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,310
is the place to make surprises.

289
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,150
Wait for me here, please.

290
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,180
Boss,

291
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,790
I want to make an outfit,

292
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,710
but it is difficult.

293
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll draw it for you.

294
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,270
Don't look.

295
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,990
Go over there.

296
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,590
It looks like this...

297
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,550
It has a veil that's this long...

298
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,990
And a very long skirt...

299
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,070
The fluffy and puffy kind...

300
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,670
Do you get it?

301
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,060
It's going to be a bit pricy.

302
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,710
2000 tael.

303
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,830
2000 tael?

304
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,390
Aren't you afraid of choking?

305
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,910
Mainly it's because of the desired design...

306
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,030
Okay, I get it.

307
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,710
Where's my surprise?

308
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,190
I just checked.

309
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,950
The surprise is too expensive.

310
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,990
Since I came to the mansion,

311
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,270
not only have I not made any money,

312
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,870
but I've also run out of my savings!

313
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,470
I don't know...

314
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,630
if you're willing to lend a hand?

315
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,470
I'll think about it.

316
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,550
That's a bit much!

317
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,870
Forget it if you don't want to.

318
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,310
That'll do it, right?

319
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,950
A kiss for a thousand tael!

320
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,390
Don't you need two thousand tael?

321
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,510
When other princes are married,

322
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,830
people pay tributes and give presents.

323
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,310
My master is the opposite.

324
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,470
He's planting the flowers

325
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,030
needed for the wedding decoration.

326
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,750
Your Highness,

327
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,150
those plants are growing so well.

328
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,180
Why did you pull them out?

329
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,110
These are weeds.

330
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,870
If they grow out,

331
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,390
the lilac won't thrive.

332
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,510
Your Highness,

333
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,070
I'll do it.

334
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,670
Please take a break.

335
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,950
No need.

336
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,150
You can do other things.

337
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,030
Yes.

338
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,630
The weeds endanger lilac, so they need elimination.

339
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,230
You are...?

340
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,710
Li?

341
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,380
Why are you...

342
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,950
If a person's existence

343
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,270
endangers other people,

344
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,670
should that person be eliminated like the weeds?

345
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,710
Be it a flower,

346
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,750
or a person,

347
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,310
if he stays where he doesn't belong,

348
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,190
he will only annoy others.

349
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,790
If you keep pestering Si Yan,

350
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,390
I won't be nice to you.

351
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,710
You misunderstood me.

352
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,590
I've given up on

353
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,310
Miss Si Yan.

354
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,100
However,

355
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,230
Prince Yi,

356
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,350
it's no use when only I gave up.

357
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,550
You should know

358
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,870
what will happen here soon.

359
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,550
What on earth is this place?

360
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,710
Why did you bring me here?

361
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,990
Who are you?

362
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,350
I am the virtual reality wake-up system's

363
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,980
assigned butler, Jack.

364
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,950
Who I am doesn't matter.

365
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,430
What matters is that

366
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,060
you need to know who you are.

367
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,750
This...

368
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,630
This...

369
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,910
What is this?

370
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,830
After hundreds of times of discussions
 and revisions,

371
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,390
the production team eventually created you.

372
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,910
Prince Yi of East City.

373
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,830
He looks calm and introverted,

374
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,350
but he does a brisk job.

375
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,790
He's considered perfect in people's eyes.

376
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,710
What's untold about him is that

377
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,190
he lives

378
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,990
in the shadow of his brother, Qi Teng.

379
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,110
How do you know all of this?

380
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,790
Those are created by others,

381
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,710
just like the characters in the play

382
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,990
in your world.

383
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,510
As a player, one of the steps

384
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,790
in Si Yan's hidden task

385
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,550
was to meet you at the stone bridge.

386
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,150
After the accident of falling into the water,

387
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,670
your life was supposed to end right there.

388
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,350
Si Yan?

389
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,510
I am her task?

390
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,830
You are not alone.

391
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,990
Qi Xiu,

392
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,030
Qi Da,

393
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,910
Qi Bao,

394
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,590
or any insignificant maid in the East Mansion

395
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,590
is pre-written programming.

396
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,670
Every one of them

397
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,710
has their missions

398
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,750
and clues

399
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,990
to help Si Yan become the Head Matron

400
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,190
and wake up in the real world.

401
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,550
She doesn't belong

402
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,060
in your world.

403
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,150
Impossible!

404
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,870
I don't believe it.

405
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,300
Don't you always hear her

406
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,990
say weird things?

407
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,030
This is Si Yan's world.

408
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,430
Because of a car accident,

409
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,550
she entered here.

410
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,070
She was supposed to complete her task easily,

411
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,950
but she met you.

412
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,630
Si Yan!

413
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,150
That is Si Yan in that world.

414
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,150
Si Yan?

415
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,030
What happened to her?

416
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,070
She tried her best

417
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,470
to become the Head Matron,

418
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,990
so she could wake up from the game.

419
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,030
But your existence

420
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,750
has disrupted everything.

421
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,230
I saved your life!

422
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,590
With it,

423
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,230
you can conceal the rashes on your body.

424
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,990
I'll make you star-crossed lovers!

425
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,580
Jack, time-out!

426
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,310
For him,

427
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,590
I can give up everything.

428
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,910
You were supposed to die.

429
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,430
Miss Si Yan

430
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,510
saved you again and again.

431
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,270
She even gave up

432
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,470
the opportunity to wake up in the real world.

433
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,550
Are you saying...

434
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,710
Si Yan could have been able to return?

435
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,540
Even if Si Yan gave up returning,

436
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,030
the whole system would

437
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,350
face crashing because of

438
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,110
the bug of you.

439
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,910
What is the consequence of crashing?

440
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,230
Si Yan will never wake up,

441
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,710
and we will all disappear.

442
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,710
We are all created by others,

443
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,110
and everything

444
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,110
is unreal.

445
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,870
Impossible...

446
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,190
Impossible...

447
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,790
Then what is real?

448
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,230
Miss Si Yan is real,

449
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,270
and her love for you is real.

450
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,070
She wants to return to the real world.

451
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,070
That's also true.

452
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,180
Without Qi Yi...

453
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,990
But because of you...

454
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,950
There's no point in me waking up.

455
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,470
She doesn't even want to return to reality.

456
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,870
How I wish that

457
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,910
she could live her life according to her wish.

458
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,390
But as a system butler,

459
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,630
I can't let her.

460
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,270
As a character in Si Yan's game,

461
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,550
you can't let her, either.

462
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,190
Only you

463
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,630
can end this.

464
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,550
If the game were to play out according to plan,

465
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,070
Si Yan could get out of here.

466
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,060
But if that's the case...

467
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,310
In that case...

468
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,270
I have to die.

469
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,390
Si Yan loves you.

470
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,100
Even though thousands of people want you dead,

471
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,350
she will be the first to stop it from happening.

472
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,990
It may sound selfish,

473
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,150
but isn't it...

474
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,060
Isn't it love?

475
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,870
I truly...

476
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,510
envy you a lot.

477
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,630
Farewell, Qi Yi.

478
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,550
You must intercept Yun Li

479
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,710
and get the heartbreak grass portion back.

480
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,270
If it's necessary,

481
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,590
you can kill him.

482
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,150
Yes.

483
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,190
Brother Xiu,

484
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,710
when will you be back?

485
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,870
Yi,

486
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,470
you are the only one

487
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,990
who didn't ask why I had to go.

488
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,750
You love Yun Li very much.

489
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,070
Please be careful on the trip.

490
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,630
Please come back early.

491
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,100
Father needs you.

492
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,300
You know that

493
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,430
I don't like the ins and outs of politics.

494
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,630
Traveling suits me better.

495
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,590
Have you heard?

496
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,870
If you keep going eastward toward South Jiuzhai,

497
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,510
there's a place called Xiwu Paradise.

498
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,220
When spring comes,

499
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,590
peach blossoms are everywhere.

500
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,190
When I find Yun Li,

501
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,990
we'll go peach blossom viewing with our swords.

502
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,070
Sounds good.

503
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,390
I've never heard of that place before.

504
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,990
What's there to be envious?

505
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,750
Don't you have Si Yan?

506
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,790
By then,

507
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,790
bring her to South Jiuzhai.

508
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,710
Maybe, when we have the chance.

509
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,350
I'm the one who's leaving.

510
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,950
Why are you down in the dumps
 as if you'll never see me again?

511
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,750
Brother Xiu,

512
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,430
sometimes

513
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,910
I feel we are like the characters in a play.

514
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,790
All the challenges we went through

515
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,670
are for engaging audiences.

516
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:07,990
You

517
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,390
and I

518
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,270
are both unreal.

519
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,430
If we are characters in a play, that'll be nice.

520
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,110
Because in plays,

521
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,750
people love happy endings the best.

522
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,100
Yi,

523
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,820
I don't know what you went through,

524
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,430
but I believe

525
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,590
everything you said.

526
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,550
When I come back,

527
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,830
if you're willing to tell me the stories,

528
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,950
I'll be all ears.

529
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,710
Sure.

530
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,870
I'll wait for your return.

531
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,510
What brings you here?

532
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,590
I can't sleep.

533
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,630
I miss you.

534
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,390
Are you hiding something from me?

535
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,630
No.

536
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,110
Don't be absurd.

537
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,429
I remember you once told me

538
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,469
that the moon in this world

539
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,260
is bright and round.

540
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,429
Too bad that

541
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,550
there's no moon today.

542
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:20,820
It's not a big deal

543
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,429
as long as you're with me.

544
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,389
Si Yan,

545
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,710
what is it like in your world?

546
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,989
Can you tell me?

547
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,989
Why are you asking this out of the blue?

548
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,630
Don't you always say

549
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,310
they're different worlds?

550
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,830
I was making things up.

551
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,790
Did you believe all that?

552
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,830
I did,

553
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,469
and I am curious.

554
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,990
My world

555
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,510
is so big that

556
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,630
you can go up in the sky and under the ground.

557
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,630
You can go wherever you want.

558
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,550
It is also so tiny that

559
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,590
all you need is a cell phone

560
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,510
and you can see people you want to see.

561
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,190
Even though you are far apart?

562
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,190
Like this?

563
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,710
Yes, like that.

564
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,630
If only there is

565
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,110
the thing

566
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,830
called cell phone in this world...

567
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:37,950
then I could

568
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,350
see you anytime and anywhere.

569
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,710
In the future,

570
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,030
if you do

571
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,190
this gesture,

572
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,990
I'll know that you miss me.

573
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,350
Rui,

574
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,470
I'm sorry.

575
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,950
If I were not impulsive,

576
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,790
you wouldn't need to

577
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,030
hide in here with me.

578
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,910
It's me who's always been hiding.

579
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,110
Until you brought me here,

580
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,350
I finally dare to face it.

581
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,830
Thank you.

582
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,710
You know what?

583
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,110
I thought that

584
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,550
I don't deserve to be happy,

585
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,550
and I don't deserve love

586
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,710
until I met you.

587
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,990
Wherever you are

588
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,910
is where my home is.

589
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,870
I won't let you down.

590
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,670
I'm delivering a letter from Prince Yi.

591
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,420
Big brother, how are you?

592
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,630
You must be shocked

593
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,550
that I know where you are.

594
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,510
The truth is that

595
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,150
Father has been looking for

596
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,390
your location secretly.

597
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,910
I wanted to visit you two in person,

598
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,950
but I don't want to intrude.

599
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,390
So I sent a messenger.

600
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,830
What's in the past,

601
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,510
be it a misunderstanding

602
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,870
or fate,

603
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,900
has already happened.

604
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,630
So, let's leave the past behind us.

605
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,150
Since you left,

606
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,870
Father has been worried.

607
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,630
Father has always had high expectations for you,

608
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,350
but

609
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,270
expectations gradually became a shackle.

610
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,950
Big brother,

611
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,150
come home.

612
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,990
Father is waiting.

613
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,950
Please tell Prince Yi

614
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,030
that I've received the letter.

615
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,310
Tell him to take care of Father.

616
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,390
Yes.

617
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,510
Wait.

618
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,630
I have a letter here.

619
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,550
Please deliver it to Miss Si Yan.

620
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,270
Si Yan,

621
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,990
How are you?

622
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,270
Although it's kind of late,

623
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,670
I still want to confess.

624
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,620
I was driving on the day of the accident.

625
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,710
I wanted nothing but to be a beauty blogger!

626
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,750
You were drunk.

627
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,830
And I was worried.

628
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,470
I didn't expect that

629
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,190
we'd get into an accident
 a few hundred meters in the ride.

630
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,230
I am very sorry

631
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,470
that I didn't tell you the truth sooner.

632
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,990
I used to

633
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,710
think that this world was only a fantasy.

634
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,630
All I cared about was the task,

635
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,350
so I deceived you.

636
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,910
Other than apologizing,

637
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,030
I also want to say thank you.

638
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,710
Thank you for showing me that

639
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,150
our emotion is the only real thing.

640
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,710
I thought that

641
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,150
I don't deserve to be happy

642
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,590
and loved in my life

643
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,270
until I met Qi Da.

644
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,510
He gave up everything to take me away.

645
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,670
At that moment,

646
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,510
I finally mustered up the courage

647
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,630
to face my utmost real emotions.

648
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,110
Now

649
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,550
I think I finally found

650
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,950
my happiness.

651
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,750
I hope you will find yours, too.

652
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,510
I will,

653
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,470
Glasses.

654
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,110
For better

655
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
or worse,

656
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,670
for richer or poorer,

657
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,470
in health

658
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,590
or in sickness,

659
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,870
I'll love you forever.

660
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,430
I'll love you forever.

661
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,350
Si Yan,

662
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,710
do brides in your world

663
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,390
all wear white wedding gowns?

664
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,190
Yes.

665
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,870
The brides in my world

666
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,670
are beautiful, right?

667
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,590
Very beautiful!

668
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,830
Si Yan,

669
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,870
I will keep you engraved deep in my heart.

670
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,950
I'll never forget you.

671
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,150
Thank you.

672
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,510
Thank you for doing all of this for me.

673
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,670
If you are so grateful,

674
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,190
use your whole life to thank me.

675
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,270
Having met you,

676
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,030
I have never regretted it.

677
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,990
Though my world might be unreal,

678
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,150
you...

679
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,700
you are my only reality.

680
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,790
Thank you

681
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,620
for helping me find myself.

682
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,790
Qi Yi,

683
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,950
What's wrong?

684
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,950
Don't scare me, Qi Yi.

685
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,230
Qi Yi...

686
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,270
Si Yan,

687
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,670
this time,

688
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,430
don't save me again.

689
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,590
Brother Yi,

690
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,110
I found Yun Li.

691
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,310
Since you'd like to keep the heartbreak grass elixir,

692
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,270
I'll leave it to you.

693
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,590
Please make sure it won't be displaced.

694
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,470
Also,

695
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,260
congratulations on getting married.

696
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,910
Go home.

697
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,430
I won't go home.

698
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,150
Don't die.

699
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:08,550
I only want you.

700
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,110
I don't want to go home.

701
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,710
No!

702
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,270
No!

703
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,510
Doctor!

704
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,510
Doctor,

705
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,900
my daughter's awake.

706
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:53,910
You're awake!

707
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,430
You're finally back.

708
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:28,870
What do you think?

709
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,030
It's not bad, isn't it?

710
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:30,630
Here is

711
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,310
the makeup style I'm featuring today.

712
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,670
It's the most unforgettable makeup style

713
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,110
and my all-time favorite.

714
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,350
I gave it a name.

715
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,510
It's

716
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,750
The Maid from the East City.

717
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,390
Wow! So beautiful!

718
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,670
What does makeup mean to you?

719
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,430
What does makeup mean to me?

720
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,670
For me,

721
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,870
it is

722
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,910
a fantasy journey

723
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,990
from the body to the soul.

724
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,510
You'll encounter

725
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,350
many unforgettable experiences.

726
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,830
Alright.

727
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,950
This is it for the day.

728
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,230
I'll see you next time.

729
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,110
Bye!

730
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,070
Miss Si Yan, excuse me.

731
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,180
As a successful beauty blogger,

732
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,550
you have led the research and development

733
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,150
of the game The Beauty Blogger 2.0

734
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,190
and become the owner of

735
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,830
a costume makeup game company.

736
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,830
Can you comment on that, please?

737
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,420
I just wanted to

738
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,150
promote the virtual reality

739
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,110
costume live-action role-playing game.

740
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,510
By combining education and entertainment,

741
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,790
traditional cultures and modern technology
 are merged.

742
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,110
Other than entertaining, I think games can

743
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,670
benefit the public, popularize science,

744
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,070
reinforce cultural heritage,

745
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,710
foster positive values

746
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,390
of the young generations,

747
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:52,470
and enable the comprehension

748
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,070
and passion about Chinese artistic traditions.

749
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,430
Alright, thank you.

750
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,870
How are you

751
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,070
over there?

752
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,870
I've taken over the game company.

753
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,150
I've also extended the game time

754
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,230
indefinitely.

755
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,700
If you want to come back,

756
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,070
anytime is fine.

757
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,630
I'm your butler, Jack.

758
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:55,710
Come.

759
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:56,870
Your adventure

760
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,030
is about to start.

761
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,630
Please make sure your VR glasses fit well.

762
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,390
I heard

763
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,230
that you hate women who act crazy when drunk.

764
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,870
Here.

765
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,350
Fill up the glass.

766
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,830
Let's make a toast

767
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,390
for a successful blind date!
