1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,910
It's you.

3
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,990
You wake up.

4
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,780
Is this the way you treat your lifesaver?

5
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,470
So you are the poisoner.

6
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,990
Rest assured.

7
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,590
I'll take care of everything you ask.

8
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,550
I know Qi Yi will

9
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,510
definitely drink the medicine because of Si Yan.

10
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,230
Relax.

11
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,550
It won't kill anyone.

12
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,990
But I just want to

13
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,310
make some trouble for them

14
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,510
in front of the First Lady.

15
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,990
So they can stay away from each other a little.

16
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,990
How can you speak so easily

17
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,030
about your meticulous plan

18
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,830
without any hesitance?

19
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,070
Don't you want to

20
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,950
keep them apart from each other?

21
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,630
Jack,

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,190
the butler.

23
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,510
How do you know I am...

24
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,350
You followed Si Yan from the Northland
all the way to the East Mansion.

25
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,270
You've taken good care of Si Yan.

26
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,470
Si Yan seems to be familiar with you too.

27
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,630
Then how can you just

28
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,870
be a common NPC?

29
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,270
I should have known that

30
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,310
for a player like Si Yan,

31
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,030
someone would help her for sure.

32
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,190
How do you get in touch with the outside world?

33
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,750
Since you know that I'm Si Yan's butler,

34
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,710
why did you save me?

35
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,030
Because you and I are on the same side.

36
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,070
We both want to separate them for good.

37
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,510
I don't.

38
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,750
Jack.

39
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,149
Because of your identity,

40
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,190
you couldn't let others know you love Si Yan.

41
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,630
Now you and Qi Yi are finally
at the same threshold,

42
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,470
but you are getting cold feet now.

43
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,380
Cooperate with me.

44
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,830
Tell me Si Yan's weaknesses.

45
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,510
As for what happened today,

46
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,550
I will keep it a secret.

47
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,590
As for the rest,

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,670
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

49
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,540
You thought you letting them be together

50
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,909
was something great?

51
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,310
That's just your excuse to hide your cowardice.

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
To love someone

53
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,030
means you have to be selfish

54
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,590
and make him or her yours.

55
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,670
If you really love her,

56
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,630
you shouldn't let others be around her.

57
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,310
You should protect her yourself.

58
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,470
It smells so good!

59
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,270
Lian Miao.

60
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,670
Are you showing off your cooking skills again?

61
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,190
Recently Prince Bao has been busy
with court issues.

62
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,950
He even forgot to eat dinners.

63
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,670
He becomes thinner and thinner.

64
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,030
I'll make some soup for him
to help him stay healthy.

65
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,590
Prince Bao, Prince Bao.

66
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,790
Why is he so lucky?

67
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,990
How can he have a future wife like you
to take care of him?

68
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,670
You always make fun of me.

69
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,870
I can't help him with anything else.

70
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,310
What I can do for him

71
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,660
are all these easy things.

72
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,030
The Second Lady is now quite strict with him.

73
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,830
She even demolished his hamster park.

74
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,790
On the surface,

75
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,190
Prince Bao has to pretend that

76
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,380
he doesn't care about that.

77
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,990
So you secretly adopted

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,070
his pet hamsters?

79
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,430
I just want to make him happy.

80
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,190
If you want me to keep a secret,

81
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,659
you will have to give me some hush money.

82
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,190
Have a try.

83
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,550
Right, Si Yan.

84
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,630
The guard who followed you back,

85
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,670
is the Jack that you've always

86
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,390
talked about?

87
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,390
How did you find him?

88
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,350
Didn't you say he left without saying goodbye?

89
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,550
Yeah.

90
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,950
But by coincidence,

91
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,830
I have found him.

92
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,830
Does he like you?

93
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,990
Otherwise,

94
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,790
why has he followed you all the time?

95
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
And

96
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,430
he treats you so well.

97
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,430
Also, I think

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,870
to you, he is special.

99
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,950
You always mention him for some reason or not.

100
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,710
Why do you always mention

101
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,909
Xiao Li,

102
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,030
Xiao Li?

103
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,470
Don't talk nonsense.

104
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,380
Do I always mention him?

105
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,910
Lian Miao,

106
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,990
Jack and I can only be friends.

107
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,990
Because of Prince Yi?

108
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,150
He is the only one in my heart.

109
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,340
Love is always distressing.

110
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,150
By the way,

111
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,790
Si Yan,

112
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,550
to the question I asked you last time,

113
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,590
do you have an answer?

114
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,150
Where are you going to hide with Prince Yi?

115
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,070
I will stay here forever

116
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,390
to accompany Qi Yi.

117
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,030
I'm not going anywhere.

118
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,990
Besiege this place.

119
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,510
Let's go.

120
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,710
It seems that Manager Xue

121
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,900
hasn't been dead long.

122
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,340
The people who killed him

123
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,950
is poisoned.

124
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,750
Be careful, Yun Li.

125
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,070
This poisonous powder...

126
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,510
Could it be that the Yun family
has come to East Mansion?

127
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,350
Luna?

128
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,030
When I wanted to kill you,

129
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,630
you could always manage to get away.

130
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,110
I have no intention to kill you today,

131
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,780
but you seem to want to be killed.

132
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,190
Who are you working for?

133
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,790
Tell me, and I'll spare your life.

134
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,950
You can keep the question

135
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,340
and go ask the King of Hell.

136
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,910
You can't get away today.

137
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,750
Yi!

138
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,990
The blood disappears here.

139
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,590
This person is very cunning.

140
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,110
He deliberately lures us here.

141
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,190
Be careful.

142
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,070
This is the poison powder found on Manager Xue.

143
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,990
It's highly toxic.

144
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,230
This poison powder is reflective.

145
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,310
Follow the powder, and we may find him.

146
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,830
Oh no.

147
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,270
The powder is in the direction of
East Mansion's gate.

148
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,230
Let's go.

149
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,870
A beautiful girl

150
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,350
looks south for the returning geese.

151
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,030
The grass is lush,

152
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,630
surrounding a green lake.

153
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,590
My life is miserable.

154
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,790
My families were separated in the chaos.

155
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,670
But my love is real.

156
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,110
I'm fortunate enough to have my love.

157
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,910
I grieved.

158
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,790
The cold chilled my bones.

159
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,710
The wind was cutting my face.

160
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,630
I looked out to my home.

161
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,230
It was so far.

162
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,390
No one ever pitied me during long nights.

163
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,030
When I was in a panic,

164
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,550
Qing Yan appeared.

165
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,950
We vowed to be together,

166
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,150
no matter how time would do to us.

167
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,830
You have gray hair too.

168
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,830
I remember

169
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,830
when you first came to the Min Mansion,

170
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,190
it was a cold winter,

171
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,950
snowing outside.

172
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,990
You were skinny and small,

173
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,830
just reaching my shoulder.

174
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,230
This means

175
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,740
when I first met you, I was already gray.

176
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm happy about that.

177
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,950
Over the years,

178
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,310
you have been following me

179
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,270
and accompanying me.

180
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,790
I know that in your heart,

181
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,870
you want to avoid all the trouble.

182
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,430
Wait a little longer.

183
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,510
When everything settles,

184
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,350
no one will be able to separate us anymore.

185
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,910
Okay.

186
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,110
I'll do whatever you say.

187
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,630
The powder should have disappeared.

188
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,540
Brother Xiu,

189
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,510
let's split up to find him.

190
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,190
Okay.

191
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,710
Let's go.

192
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,990
Today is your birthday.

193
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,150
I ask you to come, regardless of the risk,

194
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,510
because

195
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,910
I got a nice present for you.

196
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,870
From now on,

197
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,550
remember to wear this all the time.

198
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,750
Tie your hair up.

199
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,660
And I don't have to wear these

200
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,150
tedious dresses anymore.

201
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,790
We can ride together,

202
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,430
play soccer

203
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,670
and walk together in the sun.

204
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,950
We don't need to mind what others may think.

205
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,500
Qing Yan, what's wrong?

206
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,270
Qing Yan!

207
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,790
Qing Yan!

208
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,950
Manager Xue, that old bastard.

209
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,510
He expected that I would come towards him.

210
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,550
So he secretly prepared the poison powder.

211
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,070
Qing Yan.

212
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,870
Hang in there.

213
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,350
I'll find the antidote for you.

214
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,070
I won't let anything happen to you.

215
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,510
Don't...

216
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,990
Let's treasure this moment.

217
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,870
Help me wear it.

218
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,950
Put it on my hair.

219
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,950
There he is!

220
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,790
Surround this place.

221
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,220
Help me!

222
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,750
Second Lady!

223
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,670
Luna.

224
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,470
Let the Second Lady go.

225
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,710
You have no way out.

226
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,670
Don't move

227
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,350
What the hell do you want?

228
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,950
Ask the King to see me now.

229
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,310
Otherwise...

230
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,670
Don't do anything stupid.

231
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,950
I come to see you tonight

232
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,270
without any hope that I can leave alive.

233
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,260
All of you, back off!

234
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,630
She is pregnant.

235
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,070
Don't hurt the innocent.

236
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,350
Shut up!

237
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,990
The truly innocent people

238
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,310
is me.

239
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,190
Why would I love you?

240
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,910
I have loved you for 18 years.

241
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,830
The moment I entered the Min Mansion,

242
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,580
I fell in love with you.

243
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,750
At that time,

244
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,830
even if I looked at you from a distance,

245
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,350
I would feel satisfied.

246
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,630
But you!

247
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,830
How could you be so cruel?

248
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,750
You even didn't give me a chance to look at you.

249
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,790
You hated me so much

250
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,910
that you expelled me from the mansion.

251
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,349
I couldn't bear that.

252
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,910
If I couldn't have you,

253
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,190
nor would anyone have you.

254
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,190
I will soon have everything

255
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,220
that the King of the East Mansion has.

256
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,829
I can even give you more.

257
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,470
Compared with him,

258
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,790
I love you more.

259
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,510
You!

260
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,430
Why don't you love me?

261
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,550
Why don't you love me?

262
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,670
Let the Second Lady go.

263
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,950
I'll be your hostage.

264
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,750
I'll escort you to leave here.

265
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,670
As long as you're alive,

266
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,150
you will still have the chance
to see your beloved one.

267
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,590
Am I right?

268
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,070
From now on,

269
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,950
you and I are over.

270
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,750
Just by yourself,

271
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,790
how can you have the power

272
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,470
to change the entire East Mansion?

273
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,390
Not to mention you transported provisions
to the Northland.

274
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,350
Tell me.

275
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,710
Which powerful person are you
taking the blame for?

276
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,620
If I really have such a background,

277
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,550
why do I have to come here now?

278
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,230
You are from the Min family.

279
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,870
Does General Min know what you've done?

280
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,670
You're doubting General Min.

281
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,510
Prince Yi,

282
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,790
your imagination is too wild.

283
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,990
I said

284
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,990
all of this

285
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,430
is done by me, myself.

286
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,270
For my beloved one,

287
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,750
I am willing to sacrifice everything I have.

288
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,870
Yi, be careful!

289
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,780
Mother!

290
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,460
My...

291
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,750
My dear.

292
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,030
Luna wants to kill Qi Yi.

293
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm going to save him.

294
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,870
Let go of me!

295
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,790
When you see Luna,

296
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,550
aren't you afraid that
people will know you're a killer?

297
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,100
How do you know that?

298
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,030
No!

299
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,390
I have to save Qi Yi.

300
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,830
Qi Yi is fine

301
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,070
He subdued Luna.

302
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,350
It seems that

303
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,190
the only person you care about is Qi Yi.

304
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,190
Are you Jack or Xiao Li?

305
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,110
Does it matter who I am?

306
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,270
You have never cared about me after all.

307
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,750
You are Jack!

308
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,710
That's right.

309
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,310
I am the one

310
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,710
that you can only remember

311
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,870
when you're in danger,

312
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,030
or you can't finish your tasks.

313
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,950
Back then, you begged me to save Qi Yi.

314
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,220
To make your wish come true,

315
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,710
I let the system take me back.

316
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,060
I hid in the dark alone.

317
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,790
Do you know what that feels like?

318
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,590
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,230
I didn't know you had been through so much.

320
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,590
The past is all in the past.

321
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,670
For you,

322
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,150
I don't regret anything I have done.

323
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,630
Now I am not

324
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,470
the butler that has privileges anymore,

325
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,110
but a common NPC.

326
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,630
Now I want to learn to be selfish.

327
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,940
Rest assured.

328
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,070
I will find a way to

329
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,350
help you get your privileges back.

330
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,950
I will always be with you.

331
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,430
Si Yan.

332
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,150
I don't need your pity.

333
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,150
I just wish you could see me

334
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,350
or care about me.

335
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,110
To love someone

336
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,470
means you have to be selfish

337
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,950
and make him or her yours.

338
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,950
If you really love her,

339
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,150
you shouldn't let others be around her.

340
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,630
You should protect her yourself.

341
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,580
One day I will.

342
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,350
Here. Here it is!

343
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,630
It's a little princess.

344
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,670
Miss, you're awake.

345
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,270
Prince Yi, Miss Min is awake.

346
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,790
My lady,

347
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,110
His Highness watched over you
at the door all night.

348
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,790
How are you, Miss Min?

349
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,750
Your Highness has been outside the whole night.

350
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,150
You even have dark circles now.

351
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,990
Thank you, Miss Min, for saving me.

352
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,310
But why did you do that?

353
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,430
I did it on purpose.

354
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,870
I want you to care about me.

355
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,390
I saved you.

356
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,070
You will remember me.

357
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,390
Your Highness,

358
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,190
do you really think what the assassin said

359
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,550
in front of His Majesty is true?

360
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,150
What does Miss Min think?

361
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,990
His death is very strange.

362
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,150
It looks like someone sent him
to Your Highness on purpose.

363
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,950
The person behind the curtain

364
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,630
wanted to use Your Highness

365
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,070
to present a show

366
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,630
that will clear him or her.

367
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,070
In your opinion,

368
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,390
who is behind the curtain?

369
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,150
In Your Highness's heart,

370
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,140
you must already have the answer.

371
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,790
Otherwise, why did you

372
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,110
come here so frequently

373
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,430
to play chess and chat with me?

374
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,510
In that case,

375
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,670
can you tell me the answer right now?

376
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,270
Of course, I believe that

377
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,870
my father will not betray the East Mansion.

378
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,430
But I know my words are not enough

379
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,390
to dispel the doubts in Your Highness's mind.

380
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,750
If you really want to know the truth,

381
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,830
I do have an idea.

382
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,580
Except for marrying you,

383
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,790
I'll agree to anything.

384
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,790
Then we need to see

385
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,830
whether Your Highness can force my father

386
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,590
to revolt against the state.

387
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,350
Miss Min,

388
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,030
how can say this so easily?

389
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,230
On the day of our wedding,

390
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,950
my father will come.

391
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,310
By then,

392
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,140
whether my father will leave or not

393
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,310
all depends on Your Highness.

394
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,070
If my father is really
the one behind the curtain,

395
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,710
with me,

396
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,420
you can threaten my father's army.

397
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,910
Miss Min, you need to rest.

398
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,630
Take care.

399
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,190
I'd like to see,

400
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,390
in your mind,

401
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,750
if the East Mansion is more important

402
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,110
than Si Yi or not?

403
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,550
Master,

404
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,310
please don't be impulsive.

405
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,710
Director Hua,

406
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,670
how is everything going inside?

407
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,590
You must intercede for our master!

408
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,510
Prince Yi, he...

409
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,990
Just go and get some help.

410
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,950
Okay.

411
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,150
Get out of here!

412
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,950
Yi.

413
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,670
Why do you have to use such a stubborn way?

414
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,950
Brother Yi,

415
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,830
let's go back.

416
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,430
No one is allowed to intercede for him!

417
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,390
Just leave him alone on his knees.

418
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,830
Father!

419
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,870
You all leave!

420
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,990
What now?

421
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,910
Now you figure it out
and want to cooperate with me?

422
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,430
But now I may not need you anymore.

423
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,270
I advise you not to jump to conclusions
too early.

424
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,430
My lady,

425
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,590
I heard that Prince Yi

426
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,590
has been kneeling outside the court.

427
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,790
I don't know what his plan is.

428
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,110
A prince can't defy a king.

429
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,660
Right now,

430
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,870
he is just making a futile struggle.

431
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,310
Don't you forget Si Yan!

432
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,990
She is definitely not as simple as you think.

433
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,270
What can she do?

434
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,030
Si Yan really loves Prince Yi.

435
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,990
Even if everyone is against him,

436
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,820
she will still be on Qi Yi's side.

437
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,590
What should we do then?

438
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,310
But that could very well be her shackle.

439
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,990
What do you mean?

440
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,470
Si Yan doesn't remember
the truth about the car accident!

441
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,190
She always thinks

442
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,070
she is the one who caused the car accident.

443
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,310
That's why she believes she owes you.

444
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,350
You can take advantage of this.

445
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,670
But don't hurt her.

446
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,790
Si Yan.

447
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,790
How can you be so calm?

448
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,350
Aren't you going to check him out?

449
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,670
It's so cold, right?

450
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,670
I'm fine.

451
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,110
Why are you here?

452
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,310
It's so cold out here.

453
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,230
You're sure to get sick.

454
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,470
I'm fine.

455
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,350
For you,

456
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,830
I will do anything I can.

457
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,070
Parents are all merciless.

458
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,310
They can do anything to force you to marry.

459
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,110
Qi Yi.

460
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,790
Rest assured.

461
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,550
I will take care

462
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,420
of the whole matter.

463
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,830
What are you going to do?

464
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,470
There's no point interceding for me.

465
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,190
So you won't feel cold anymore.

466
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,110
You should go back now.

467
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,870
Hang in there.

468
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,270
Be good!

469
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,870
Are you hungry?

470
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,870
You've brought so many things to eat.

471
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,390
Which one do you want to eat?

472
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:34,750
This one.

473
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,630
Is it good?

474
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,870
This is also delicious.

475
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,870
Try this one.

476
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,910
Aren't you afraid?

477
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,910
I know it's you.

478
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,630
Put it on.

479
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,510
Did you make this?

480
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,990
Are you warm?

481
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,420
Aren't you tired?

482
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,030
I am not tired.

483
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,790
For us,

484
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm not tired.

485
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,990
Someone is coming.

486
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,110
I'll go first.

487
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,750
Go back now.

488
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,989
Why are you here?

489
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,469
Let go of Qi Yi.

490
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,750
That will be good for both of us.

491
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,270
Here we go again.

492
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,110
I just don't get it.

493
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,139
You obviously like Qi Da.

494
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,030
Why do you have to ask me to give him up?

495
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,310
Since what is done is done,

496
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,870
I don't want to hide it anymore.

497
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,989
My ultimate goal

498
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,870
is Qi Yi.

499
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,429
Only by marrying him

500
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,310
and getting a wedding kiss,

501
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,030
can I complete my mission.

502
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,150
The wedding?

503
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,219
Initially, this game is

504
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,630
a single-player game.

505
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,150
Only one player can enter at one time.

506
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,710
If Mr. Si hadn't

507
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,870
forced you to enter the game

508
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,950
with his money,

509
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,750
I could have gotten out a long time ago.

510
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,630
Now there's a conflict between our missions,

511
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,190
because the key to our missions

512
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,990
is Qi Yi.

513
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,030
So that's why.

514
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,710
The most important thing now is that

515
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,230
we need to find a way
to get our missions completed

516
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,950
and get out of here.

517
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,390
My mission,

518
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,070
I'm afraid it can't be completed.

519
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,990
As for yours,

520
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,190
there is nothing I can do.

521
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,310
Your mission is to assassinate Qi Yi.

522
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,110
I already know that.

523
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,190
You can let me marry him first,

524
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,470
and then you kill him.

525
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,460
In that case, we both can complete our missions

526
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,510
and wake up.

527
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,660
But if I kill him first,

528
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,230
you will never be able to go back.

529
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,670
If you kill him first,

530
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,590
perhaps my mission will change.

531
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,270
I don't need to talk nonsense to you now.

532
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,550
Why do you have to change

533
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,830
the fate of a living human being?

534
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,510
Is that as easy as you said?

535
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,070
Your mission is important.

536
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,150
Is Qi Yi not important?

537
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,910
Qi Yi is just an NPC.

538
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,470
What he said to you

539
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,310
and did to you

540
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,790
can all be repeated on other players.

541
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,190
Don't forget reality for a virtual character!

542
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,230
Our families are still waiting for us
in the outside world.

543
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,580
Really?

544
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,470
Do you really think

545
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,750
they are simply NPCs?

546
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,990
Don't you forget

547
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,390
who caused the car accident.

548
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,710
If it hadn't been because of you,

549
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,110
how would I have gotten in here?

550
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,270
I just want to wake up.

551
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,310
Is it wrong?

552
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,310
What's wrong with you?

553
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,510
My body

554
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,670
can't last long.

555
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,310
The marriage

556
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,990
is my only chance.

557
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,550
Why are you here?

558
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,430
Go back now.

559
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,100
What's going on?

560
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,710
Do you worry about me?

561
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,470
Don't kneel anymore.

562
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,110
Get up now.

563
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,470
Why?

564
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,620
I can hold on.

565
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,950
You and I both know

566
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,670
His Majesty is determined
to let you marry Miss Min.

567
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,910
I don't want to see you suffer anymore.

568
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,630
I don't want to ruin your relationship
with His Majesty either.

569
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,990
Miss Min is your home.

570
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,270
If I had been afraid of suffering,

571
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,940
I wouldn't have knelt so long.

572
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,460
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

573
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,310
Actually...

574
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,670
I've never had a good relationship
with my father.

575
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,150
He wanted me to get married early.

576
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,070
But I didn't want to.

577
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,270
So I went for a drink.

578
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,630
But I didn't expect

579
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,030
I dragged a girl into this game.

580
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,470
She and I started a new journey.

581
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,150
In this journey,

582
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,790
I have gained friendships

583
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,620
and love.

584
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,870
I have even realized
the preciousness of family love.

585
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,670
I have got a lot of precious emotions.

586
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,230
I think

587
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,070
this is a better world than the one
I lived in before.

588
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,350
But...

589
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,870
I can't impose my feelings

590
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,430
on an innocent girl.

591
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,910
Perhaps everything I treasure

592
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,830
is a nightmare for her.

593
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,830
I can't just stand by and watch.

594
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,870
I can't do anything.

595
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,870
But does that have anything to do

596
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,550
with my engagement to Miss Min?

597
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,580
That girl is Miss Min.

598
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,590
I have owed her so much already.

599
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,430
I can't owe her anything more.

600
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,070
If you get married to her,

601
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,110
that will make her happy.

602
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,350
What right do I have to keep you?

603
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,630
Because you owe her,

604
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,310
you can give up our love.

605
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,580
Then what am I?

606
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,350
You can think of it as a dream.

607
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,670
In this dream,

608
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,110
everyone has his or her own character setting,

609
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,510
has his or her time to start

610
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,230
and time to end.

611
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,310
Si Yan.

612
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,300
Even if it's a dream,

613
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,630
please don't leave me either.

614
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,510
Don't go away, okay?

615
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,870
I'm begging you.

616
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,310
We can get through this.

617
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,150
Let go of me, Qi Yi.

618
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,710
I have no choice.

619
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,350
Si Yan.

620
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,740
Si Yan.

621
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,110
Jack.
