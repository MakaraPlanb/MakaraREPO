00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,670
Jack.

3
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,710
What is this place?

4
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,670
Last time I said something wrong.

5
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,110
I shouldn't have said that about you.

6
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,510
None of this matters anymore.

7
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,460
Congratulations, Si Yan.

8
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,350
You have completed the mission.

9
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,510
You will wake up soon.

10
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,470
Really?

11
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,990
That's not right.

12
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,870
I am not yet the Head Matron.

13
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,900
So how could I complete my mission?

14
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,030
Where is Qi Yi?

15
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,070
Qi Yi! Qi Yi!

16
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,990
Who the hell did this?

17
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,150
How did he become like this?

18
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,710
What's going on?

19
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,230
A person who looks like you

20
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,670
killed him with a hairpin.

21
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,910
What?

22
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,829
Who pretended to be me?

23
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,950
Si Yan.

24
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,230
Don't stay here anymore.

25
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,300
You're about to wake up.

26
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,270
To wake up?

27
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,910
No.

28
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,190
I can't wake up.

29
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,550
Jack.

30
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,230
I beg you.

31
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,230
Please help me.

32
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,710
Please help me save him, okay?

33
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,630
It's okay if you need to read a file,

34
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,190
ask the system for help,

35
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,510
or even send me back to the initial interface.

36
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,430
I just want him to come back to life.

37
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,630
I beg you!

38
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,270
For Qi Yi?

39
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,150
I can't leave like this.

40
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,740
I can't let him die because of me.

41
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,550
Even if you restart the game,

42
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,990
you still can't change the result

43
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,820
that Qi Yi, the NPC, will die.

44
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,710
Are you sure you want to refuse

45
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,190
to wake up for him?

46
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,270
I know.

47
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,590
You will never understand how I feel now.

48
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,070
But without Qi Yi,

49
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,870
my waking up will be meaningless.

50
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,430
For him,

51
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,070
I can give up everything.

52
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,470
So no matter what the result is,

53
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,230
I want to try again.

54
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,470
I can save him.

55
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,630
Really?

56
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,990
But if I saved him,

57
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,590
then one of the people in the game
would be gone.

58
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,670
Even so,

59
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,950
are you still going to save him?

60
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,470
No one is more important than him.

61
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,350
No one.

62
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,230
I just want him to be alive.

63
00:05:59,470 --> 00:05:59,990
Right.

64
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,510
No one is more important than him.

65
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,510
Fine.

66
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,470
Until then,

67
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,550
cooperate with me

68
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,190
to handle the situation right now.

69
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,550
But you can tell no one about this matter.

70
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,510
It must be confidential.

71
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,670
You can't even tell Yi.

72
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,430
Can you see me?

73
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,950
Si Yan, what's wrong with you?

74
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,470
It's before the autumn hunt.

75
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,430
What's going on?

76
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,430
Am I reborn?

77
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,030
So Qi Yi is not dead now.

78
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,950
I still have a chance.

79
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,470
Prince Xiu,

80
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,670
before it's too late,

81
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,909
you have to cancel the fall hunt right away.

82
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,540
Are you kidding me?

83
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,310
I'm not kidding with you.

84
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,110
Then why did you cancel
the autumn hunt out of blue?

85
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,380
Do you know that

86
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,790
the autumn hunt is the most important event
in the East Mansion every year?

87
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,909
I know that.

88
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,110
You may not believe me when I say this,

89
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,630
but something bad will happen
during the fall hunt this time.

90
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,870
At that time, someone will die.

91
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,710
How can you just stand by and ignore that

92
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,870
someone's life is at risk?

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,670
Si Yan, are you drunk, or do you have a fever?

94
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,030
What nonsense!

95
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,710
Someone will die? Who?

96
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,820
The clansmen are now coming to the East Mansion.

97
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,430
If the fall hunt is canceled now,

98
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,950
I will be the first one to die.

99
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,630
Prince Xiu.

100
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,550
Moreover!

101
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,020
Now the fall hunt is the only chance

102
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,670
to annul our engagement.

103
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,110
Are you really going to marry me?

104
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,190
That's not a good deal for me.

105
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,380
Fire! Fire!

106
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,510
Come on, someone!

107
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,110
What's going on?

108
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,909
Your Highness,

109
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,590
I just found a black shadow
jumping into the courtyard,

110
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,190
and then the wall was on fire.

111
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,789
Assassin?

112
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,669
Could that be the assassin
who assassinated Qi Yi?

113
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,990
Yi is too narrow-minded.

114
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,830
There are assassins.

115
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,150
Be careful.

116
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,830
Thank you.

117
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,310
Where is the assassin?

118
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,390
Brother Xiu,

119
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,390
an assassin broke into the mansion
and set fire to it.

120
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,430
Brother Da has led people
to investigate the west side.

121
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,270
You go with me to investigate the west side.

122
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,550
Go put out the fire!

123
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,190
Yes!

124
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,140
Brother Xiu, what's wrong?

125
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,790
Nothing.

126
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,750
I'm just so happy to see you.

127
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,270
So it was you who set the fire.

128
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,310
Yi, go catch the assassin first.

129
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,430
Otherwise, more people will come,

130
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,230
and it will be hard to explain.

131
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,150
I'm not afraid of the cold.

132
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,310
I'm not afraid to die either.

133
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,270
I'm just afraid that

134
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,830
I don't understand you.

135
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,020
Qi Yi.

136
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,630
This time I will protect you.

137
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,870
Prince Xiu is so romantic.

138
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,710
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

139
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,660
Tell Prince Xiu

140
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,030
to change all the chiffon.

141
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,670
Have you seen Prince Yi?

142
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,950
Go, go, go!

143
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,790
Stop.

144
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,350
I know you're in a hurry.

145
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,470
These linen curtain hats are

146
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,190
thin, sun-protective,

147
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,870
waterproof, sweatproof and easy to carry.

148
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,470
It is suitable for masters.

149
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,230
This is way much better

150
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,350
than a chiffon curtain hat.

151
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,870
Don't dawdle.

152
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,110
You guys can go and give it to your maters.

153
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,790
Go, go, go!

154
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,950
I have been waiting for more than 2 hours.

155
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,100
It's my business.

156
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,670
Don't worry about it.

157
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
You'd better handle

158
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,990
all the hats you have right now.

159
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,430
If you can't deal with that properly,

160
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,830
how much money will be lost?

161
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,910
It's such a waste.

162
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,550
How did she know?

163
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,190
Is Prince Yi in there?

164
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,390
No.

165
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,470
Why do these tents look exactly the same?

166
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

167
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,950
Where exactly is Qi Yi?

168
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,350
Right.

169
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,430
I can fly a kite to find him.

170
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,270
I must hurry to find Lan Miao.

171
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,790
Si Yan, why are you here?

172
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,710
Don't cover.

173
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,820
I know who you are making it for.

174
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,310
Lan Miao, lend me the kite.

175
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,790
Qi Yi.

176
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,070
It's an emergency.

177
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,470
I don't have time to explain.

178
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,510
I made it for Prince Bao.

179
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,140
Qi Yi.

180
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,230
Si Yan.

181
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,830
Why are you here?

182
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,190
Why can't I be here?

183
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,190
About curtain hats,

184
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,310
I can help you solve that problem.

185
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,870
How are you going to thank me properly?

186
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,510
Have you seen Prince Yi?

187
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,270
Your husband is right here.

188
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,470
Why are you looking for Prince Yi?

189
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,060
Mrs. Huang is watching from behind.

190
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,430
Play well.

191
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,790
I don't have time for this right now.

192
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,870
Where are you going in such a hurry?

193
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,750
To fly a kite.

194
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,590
Kite, please.

195
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,670
Take me to find Qi Yi.

196
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,700
Didn't you write that wrong?

197
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,910
Shouldn't that be "Cheer up, Prince Xiu"?

198
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,670
Don't rush to be jealous first.

199
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,870
I want to tell you something.

200
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,980
Just now, Brother Xiu hugged you.

201
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,870
And now you come to me.

202
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,750
Brother Yi. Si Yan.

203
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,470
Lan Miao gave you this.

204
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,390
So it is her.

205
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,950
Out of no reason,

206
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,220
why did Si Yan ask to change the purple chiffon?

207
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,390
What was she thinking?

208
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,110
Yi.

209
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,630
Come.

210
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,550
What do you think?

211
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,109
This is your first time hosting a fall hunt.

212
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,550
Naturally, you have to

213
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,109
do something different from the previous years.

214
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,790
You have a point.

215
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,150
I think it's not dramatic at all.

216
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,380
The color is great.

217
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,630
Why the purple chiffon is still here?

218
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,070
Change it now.

219
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,470
Otherwise, His Majesty will ask you
to change the setting.

220
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,030
Prince Xiu,

221
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,030
change

222
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,700
and rearrange everything.

223
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,870
How do you know what my father thinks?

224
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,590
I...

225
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,910
I guessed.

226
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,950
How pity, Prince Xiu.

227
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,350
You need to rearrange everything now.

228
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,750
So mean.

229
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,430
In my opinion,

230
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,710
it's not that hard to set up a hunting ground.

231
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,390
It's all about simplifying.

232
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,470
Just leave some flowers and plants to decorate.

233
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,190
And get someone to chop firewood
to boil water for tea.

234
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,270
That will be idyllic

235
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,590
and bring some freshness during the hot days.

236
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,940
That sounds like a great idea.

237
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,670
Then, please...

238
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,150
I'm not going.

239
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,190
There is no need.

240
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,990
I'll just get some footboys
to take care of that.

241
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,870
Prince Xiu, do you care about her?

242
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,020
You have already started
to protect your fiancée.

243
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,270
Lady Si Yan.

244
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,750
You've got a lot of charm.

245
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,940
Prince Xiu didn't mean that.

246
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,820
I just happen to do

247
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,670
something else.

248
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,270
Prince Xiu's clothing is torn.

249
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,550
I'll go get him a new dress.

250
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,430
Si Yan is really concerned about Prince Xiu.

251
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,750
Why don't Your Highness come with me?

252
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,590
I do not know where Prince Xiu's clothes are.

253
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,750
Let's go.

254
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,830
My clothing?

255
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,270
Is my dress torn?

256
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,870
Why do you drag me here?

257
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,070
Let's stay here, okay?

258
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,790
Chat, or do whatever you like.

259
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,660
Just don't go out.

260
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,630
You were the one who set the fire last night.

261
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,950
If you dare to go out,

262
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,510
I'll tell everyone about that.

263
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,420
Are you threatening me?

264
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,630
As long as you don't go out,
I can do anything for you.

265
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,870
I really do not understand you more and more.

266
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,350
What the hell do you want?

267
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,190
You really can't go out.

268
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,350
It's dangerous to go out.

269
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,430
Stop making these weak excuses.

270
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,220
Is it in your heart that

271
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,270
I,

272
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,950
Brother Xiu

273
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,150
and Brother Bao

274
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,590
are so ridiculous?

275
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,150
It's not like that. You misunderstood me.

276
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,150
No one will act like a fool,

277
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,550
willing to be fooled by you again and again.

278
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,630
It's you I like.

279
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,310
You have no idea about what I think.

280
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,750
I did these all for you.

281
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,270
The reason why I took the task

282
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,710
is that I was set up by someone.

283
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,190
My engagement with Prince Xiu

284
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,630
is only a temporary one.

285
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,230
We planed to get the first prize
in the autumn hunt

286
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,870
and go beg His Majesty to cancel the engagement.

287
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,550
Do I make myself clear now?

288
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,470
Then why didn't you make yourself clear earlier?

289
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,190
I almost thought you were really going to
marry Brother Xiu.

290
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,990
Aren't I telling you now?

291
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,740
About the annulment of your engagement,

292
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,630
I'll try to fix that.

293
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,430
No need.

294
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,350
No need?

295
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,470
So you mean

296
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,510
you regret it again?

297
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,430
No, I don't regret it.

298
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,430
Is there anything more important

299
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,470
than annul your engagement?

300
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,390
Yes.

301
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,230
Today,

302
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,190
there's nothing

303
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,270
more important than you.

304
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,190
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,190
I have to protect you.

306
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,750
Wait for me.

307
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,030
Qi Yi.

308
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,710
Hold on for a while.

309
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,830
I'll be back soon.

310
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,470
Someone hid an arrow here.

311
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,270
So it's a plan.

312
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,790
I won't let you get your way.

313
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,070
Prince Xiu is in the carriage.

314
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,830
He wants to talk to you.

315
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,630
Prince Xiu?

316
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,990
My lady, I have deceived Si Yan

317
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,430
into the carriage as you ordered.

318
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,470
She should be in the misty forest by now.

319
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,870
Thank you.

320
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,910
Where's my arrow?

321
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,990
Father, we should go this way.

322
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,910
Go.

323
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,230
What kind of brother is Yi?

324
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,870
He left without telling us,

325
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,230
and took away my carefully selected horse.

326
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,230
Luckily, I have let you arrange it in advance today,

327
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,220
or else how can we win the first prize today?

328
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,990
How are things over there?

329
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,550
All done.

330
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,390
Father, since you are determined
 to let me get married,

331
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,350
don't blame me for being unkind.

332
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,910
Yun Li, act accordingly in a while.

333
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,110
I'll make you a knife case when I'm back.

334
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,030
Go.

335
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,550
Xiu.

336
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,190
Are there any beasts you're talking about?

337
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,710
Father, I saw it with my own eyes 
when I prospect this place.

338
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,030
We should go further inside the woods?

339
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,430
Maybe we'll find one.

340
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,070
Wait.

341
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,030
Why do I feel like

342
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,510
we just passed by this place?

343
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,390
No, father.

344
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,230
You have to be patient.

345
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,670
Go.

346
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,150
Congrats, Da, you've caught your first prey.

347
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,150
Thanks for your assist, Tong.

348
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,710
You're welcome, Prince Da.

349
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,310
It's because you are good at archery.

350
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,910
Da, why are you looking at me like this?

351
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,350
No-nothing.

352
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,470
Prince Da, what reward do you want

353
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,870
for the best hunter prize?

354
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,510
I just want my father to be proud of me.

355
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,310
It doesn't matter what the reward is.

356
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,550
Prince Xiu and Prince Yi

357
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,190
have been engaged.

358
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,100
Have you never thought about marriage?

359
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,990
I aspire to a great career.

360
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,430
Marriage is not in my plan.

361
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,220
But...

362
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,550
But what?

363
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,990
But it would be nice if Tong had a sister.

364
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,710
That's a good one.

365
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,870
Only by killing you

366
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,590
can I become the real Miss Min.

367
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,390
Watch out!

368
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,190
You

369
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,350
are a woman?

370
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,270
Is the target of mine

371
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,460
related to the lotus flower?

372
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,350
How can you do this?

373
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,030
I don't want to see you anymore.

374
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,100
Prince Da.

375
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,910
I couldn't control myself.

376
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,350
I almost thought I liked men.

377
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,830
Prince Da, I've been in love with you

378
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,150
since the first time I met you.

379
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,110
But I'm just a maid.

380
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,710
I couldn't get close to you, 
that's why I decided to do this

381
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,670
Dressing up as a man

382
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,430
is the only way I can think of to get close to you.

383
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,630
But, Prince Da,

384
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,110
You are not nervous talking to me.

385
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,350
I don't stutter anymore.

386
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,310
I really don't stutter in front of you.

387
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,750
Prince Da, I'm so happy for you

388
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,110
that your trouble is gone.

389
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,030
I shouldn't do this in the first place.

390
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,950
Prince Da, please punish me.

391
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,430
-You?
-You?

392
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,350
Where is Qi Yi?

393
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,150
Tell me! Where is Qi Yi?

394
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,220
What are you doing?

395
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,870
Oh, my god. Why are you here?

396
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,940
I hid you so well.

397
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,070
What are you doing here?

398
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,510
Your knockout drops are not strong.

399
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,230
I fainted because I was unguarded.

400
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,510
Get out of here!

401
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,830
Besides, it should be me asking you.

402
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,310
Why did you do that to me?

403
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,350
What are you up to?

404
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,230
Why do I feel like

405
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,470
I've been here?

406
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,300
Not only been here, but you died here.

407
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,310
Leave now.

408
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,350
I don't care how.

409
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,670
You don't know how sad I was!

410
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,430
Is there something you didn't tell me?

411
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,790
Qi Yi.

412
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,110
I've been having a hunch lately.

413
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,350
I had dreams.

414
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,670
Yeah, what I have dreamed of 
always happen in reality.

415
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,660
I dreamed that

416
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,510
you had a detoxicating elixir on you, right?

417
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,630
How did you know?

418
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,110
I also dreamed that someone would hurt you.

419
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,870
You will die!

420
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,150
Someone would hurt me?

421
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,190
Here?

422
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,070
Oh no, he's coming soon.

423
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,750
Trust me.

424
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,230
I can't explain things to you now.

425
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,830
I'll dress like you

426
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,110
to lure the killer out.

427
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,190
No way. I'll do it myself.

428
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,270
I can't let you do that.

429
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,430
I'll be a shadow

430
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,700
and lure the killer out.

431
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,790
That way we can live.

432
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,150
I am smart.

433
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,100
You have to trust me.

434
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,350
I trust you, too.

435
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,870
You can definitely protect me.

436
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,070
I warned you.

437
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,150
Don't forget who you are.

438
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,310
Yet you've thwarted our plan

439
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,470
again and again.

440
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,190
Did you forget who fed you?

441
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,590
Who got you into East City?

442
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,420
Why do you have to kill Qi Yi?

443
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,910
What's the reason for Master to hate Qi Yi?

444
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,550
Who is Master?

445
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,710
Who is Master?

446
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,310
How dare you ask that?

447
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,470
As for the assassination of Qi Yi,

448
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,750
shouldn't it be a task of yours?

449
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,270
What?

450
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,790
Did you really fall for him?

451
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,190
I knew it.

452
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,990
How can Master let you

453
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,270
go on an assassination plan alone?

454
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,670
Say it.

455
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,390
Where is Qi Yi?

456
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,830
Qi Yi, watch out!

457
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,430
What a pair of love birds.

458
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,790
But tonight,

459
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,470
both of you are going to be killed by me.

460
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,630
Qi Yi, you lived for now

461
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,270
doesn't mean you'll always be lucky.

462
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,190
Staying with that woman

463
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,430
will eventually kill you!

464
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,270
You'll regret it!

465
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,470
Father,

466
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,190
why don't we take a break?

467
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,270
We seem lost.

468
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,389
I told you to specialize in 
horse back riding and hunting,

469
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,909
but you never listened.

470
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,940
You are a prince.

471
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,070
How can you be like this?

472
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,989
I'm ashamed!

473
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,909
Father, wait for me.

474
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,710
I have never been good at this.

475
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,060
It's useless to learn it.

476
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,030
I think it's not that you're not good at it,

477
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,070
it's that you pretend to be.

478
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,389
Is it something that I have done to you

479
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,790
that makes you so reluctant

480
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,030
to show people who you really are?

481
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,150
All you do is

482
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,030
pretend to be an idiot and hang out with girls.

483
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,870
I think that's fine too.

484
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,270
There is wine to drink, music to sing,
 and flowers to admire.

485
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,430
Isn't it happy?

486
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,350
You seem happy enough.

487
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,390
You are the prince of East City.

488
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,070
How can you stay with a person

489
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,420
from nowhere every day?

490
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,540
My reputation

491
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,220
is all ruined by you.

492
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,310
Don't hurt him.

493
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,310
Are you saying I can't do that?

494
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,430
Father, we all want to do different things.

495
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,310
Everyone's path is different.

496
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,190
Even if you get lost,

497
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,670
you will see special scenery.

498
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,220
Am I right?

499
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,110
You can't ask me

500
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,790
to be like Da and Yi.

501
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,990
As for Yun Li,

502
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,110
he has lived a miserable life,

503
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,430
orphaned and displaced since childhood.

504
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,550
Since I brought him to East City,

505
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,390
I won't ask him to leave.

506
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,510
Do you know his true identity?

507
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,790
He is a descendant

508
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,030
of the notorious Yun family in South Jiuzhai.

509
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,430
The Yun family specializes in crooked ways.

510
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,710
They make poison and harm people!

511
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,190
If you keep such a person by your side,

512
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,310
it'll be like taking a tiger as a pet.

513
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,390
He is different from the ruthless Yun family.

514
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,070
How?

515
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,070
What do you know? You know nothing!

516
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,830
I know that

517
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,070
he cares about me wholeheartedly

518
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,150
and he will never hurt me.

519
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,510
I also know that

520
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,270
he is the person I must protect with my life.

521
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,150
Yun Li's father died in East City.

522
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,830
Do you know that?

523
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,630
Father,

524
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,550
let's gt out of here.

525
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,420
Did you hear wolves howling?

526
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,390
Father,

527
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,710
please cancel my engagement with that maid,

528
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,430
or I don't think I can find a way out.

529
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:32,950
Keep up.

530
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,630
Hurry.

531
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,230
Is anything wrong with the Second Lady's tent?

532
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,390
The Second Lady felt unwell.

533
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,140
She's resting in the tent.

534
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,350
Don't you see that we are all outside the tent?

535
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,790
Let's search elsewhere.

536
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,790
I'm fine. Let me walk.

537
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,430
The road is bumpy, don't jiggle.

538
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,030
Do you have a lot to ask me?

539
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,710
Yes.

540
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,030
But,

541
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,030
I'd rather wait until you want to tell me.

542
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,590
Qi Yi.

543
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,310
What?

544
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,950
That's a sneak attack.

545
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,870
Too many things

546
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,430
feel familiar today.

547
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,470
But there's one thing

548
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,230
I'm sure it didn't happen.

549
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,790
What is true and what is false?

550
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,230
It's like the moon in the sky.

551
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,510
At this moment,

552
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,030
it's meaningless to struggle about that.

553
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,710
Some people may think that

554
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,030
what happens in this game world is fake.

555
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,630
But these two unique memories

556
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,150
will eventually become some kind of reality.

557
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,150
No one is more important than him.

558
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,630
Si Yan

559
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,670
I'm sorry.

560
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,710
I shouldn't be selfish.

561
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,380
But for you,

562
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,790
I can give up everything.

563
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,830
I love you, Si Yan.

564
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,630
Who are you?

565
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,510
I am your exclusive butler, Jack.

566
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,460
You are so handsome.

567
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,830
Too bad I'm the only one who can see you.

568
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,830
What a waste!

569
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,110
Miss Si Yan.

570
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,990
I am only wearing it for you.

571
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,710
In the whole world,

572
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,660
you are the best.

573
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,550
It's my job to make you happy.

574
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,270
Such a handsome butler.

575
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,510
I can see you but not touch you.

576
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,670
Looks like you're useful after all.

577
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,670
Try some.

578
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,350
Cheers.

579
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,230
Thank you.

580
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,380
Jack, time-out.

581
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,830
Miss Si Yan.

582
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,790
There are only two time-outs.

583
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,900
You have used both of them.

584
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,950
Today, you can have a day off.

585
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,390
You are not the butler, but my friend, Li.

586
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,550
Do you like it?

587
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,590
I love you, Si Yan.

588
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,390
Saying it out loud,

589
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,670
makes me feel better

590
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,470
in the endless darkness.
