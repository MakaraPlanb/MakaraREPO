1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,110
Lady Min.

3
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,270
How did it go?

4
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,390
I followed your instruction

5
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,350
and took care of everything.

6
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,910
Si Yan is responsible for
 purchasing the sun-blocking hats.

7
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,670
Well done.

8
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,860
Which merchant does she go to buy hats?

9
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,870
I did everything for you, my lady.

10
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,950
You stole my jewelry and pawned them.

11
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,620
Was that also for me?

12
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,270
Si Yan

13
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,590
is obviously flirting with Prince Yi.

14
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,350
She's stealing Prince Yi

15
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,350
and the marriage from you.

16
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,020
I'm just trying to help you.

17
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,590
You are targeting Si Yan.

18
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,430
What were you planning on doing?

19
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,790
I will buy out all the hats in East City,

20
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,950
so she can't complete her task.

21
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,070
I want her to get kicked out.

22
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,270
Just buying all the hats is not enough.

23
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,100
You need to also buy out all the raw materials.

24
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,950
Only by doing so

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,790
will she fail.

26
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,190
Do you agree, my lady?

27
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,950
You can only succeed.

28
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,470
You're not allowed to fail.

29
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,990
Place your bets.

30
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,390
Listen up.

31
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,750
Place your bet here if you think the poster will be taken off.

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,910
This side is the opposite.

33
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,790
Ten-to-one odds.

34
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,630
Ten-to-one odds. Ten-to-one odds.

35
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,310
Hurry.

36
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,950
Xiu,

37
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,790
what's the occasion? Why do we come here today?

38
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,630
I'm going to make a big fortune soon,

39
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,870
so...

40
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,590
I'm treating you and Yi to a meal.

41
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,710
Did you place your bet?

42
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,630
Yes.

43
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,510
1000 taels.

44
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,589
Xiu,

45
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,790
don't tell me that you also placed a bet?

46
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,910
Which side did you bet on?

47
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,790
Surely, I bet no one will take off the poster.

48
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,190
It's guaranteed to win.

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,070
It's the ten-to-one odds.

50
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,670
How could you be so sure of that?

51
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,030
They wouldn't dare.

52
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,310
Order anything you want.

53
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,390
It's on me.

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,590
Xiu,

55
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,750
I think

56
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,030
you shouldn't be happy too early.

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,750
Things might turn out badly.

58
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,070
Bao,

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,110
I know things aren't going well for you,

60
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,180
but don't try to affect me with your bad luck!

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,750
I always took your side.

62
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,190
How ungrateful you are!

63
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,670
Your Highnesses,

64
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,590
here is the wine.

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,830
Big brother?

66
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,150
Why are you all here?

67
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,350
Xiu just bet

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,980
that no one's taking off the poster.

69
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,710
He's buying us lunch saying he'll win the bet,

70
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,590
and we can order anything.

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,630
Ridiculous.

72
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,310
This is...?

73
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,870
Your Highnesses should have some privacy.

74
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,830
Please excuse me.

75
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,350
Don't act like a stranger.

76
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,870
He is

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,110
my adviser, Tong.

78
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,070
You've met

79
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,990
all these princes.

80
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,150
Let's sit together.

81
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,100
Since you're here,

82
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,510
let's sit together.

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,430
Bao, don't drink so much.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,870
Yi,

85
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,390
you're finally here.

86
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,710
Xiu,

87
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,500
tell me

88
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,190
who do you think

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,710
put the clothes on Little Wan?

90
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,030
Bao,

91
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,830
whoever it is

92
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,030
won't be the person you think it is.

93
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,550
Drink less.

94
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,260
Leave me alone.

95
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,470
The romance storyline seems activated,

96
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,659
and it's a love triangle!

97
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,260
Who is this?

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,630
Si Yan?

99
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,830
Yun Li,

100
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,909
anything but that name!

101
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,830
The troublemaker is here.

102
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,670
Si Yan!

103
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,310
Prince Xiu!

104
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,550
Come on up!

105
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,590
Why is she here?

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,660
Your Highness,

107
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,110
I have some business to do

108
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,230
if you'll excuse me.

109
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,070
No.

110
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,180
Si Yan,

111
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,630
don't be a party pooper.

112
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,550
If you leave,

113
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,630
the party games won't be fun.

114
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,710
Right?

115
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,350
What games are we playing?

116
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,430
The drinking game.

117
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,590
You gotta be kidding me.

118
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,310
Whoever the bottle opening points at

119
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,340
will draw from one of the two lottery containers.

120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,670
One is Truth.

121
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,070
The other is Dare.

122
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,670
Is this the drinking game?

123
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,830
The producing team is super down-to-earth.

124
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,190
Truth or Dare?

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,750
I choose dare.

126
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,070
Bao, what does it say?

127
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,030
Excuse me, Da.

128
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,270
What were you doing, Bao?

129
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,550
Disrespectful!

130
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:12,990
Brother Da,

131
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,510
the dare I got was

132
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,510
carry someone next to me in my arms

133
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,710
and twirl.

134
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,710
Then why didn't you carry her?

135
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,310
What a stupid game!

136
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,230
Brother Da,

137
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,900
don't be a sour loser.

138
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,070
the tables are turning.

139
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,710
Maybe the next round

140
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,550
is still you.

141
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,990
Xiu is right.

142
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,670
Don't be a sour loser.

143
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,700
I am not.

144
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,030
Xiu,

145
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,830
don't put it off.

146
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,550
Kiss someone you'd like to kiss the most.

147
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,190
Who came up with the dare?

148
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,230
So demeaning!

149
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,990
What will you do, Xiu?

150
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,710
Have you picked the person yet?

151
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,710
If you really can't choose,

152
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,590
take the punishment.

153
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,550
Shout out you're a coward three times,

154
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,870
and we'll cut you some slack.

155
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,150
Who says I haven't picked the person?

156
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,270
You!

157
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,750
Come on. Let's drink!

158
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,470
Let's continue.

159
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,590
I'll pick dare.

160
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,750
Imitate a woman and shout "I'm the most beautiful."

161
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,710
It's ridiculous.

162
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,950
Brother Da,

163
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,550
don't be so humble.

164
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,590
Don't you remember that

165
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,780
you dressed like a girl when you were little?

166
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,030
It was because

167
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,590
you pushed me off the boat.

168
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,780
I was drenched,

169
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,590
but you brought me the maid's clothes.

170
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,990
Yi was trying to prank me,

171
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,870
but you wanted to switch spots with me.

172
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,110
I forgot.

173
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,190
I'm the most beautiful of all.

174
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,670
Drink up!

175
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,550
Truth.

176
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,270
Pick one.

177
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,030
Biggest wish when you were a kid?

178
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,870
I don't think I had any wishes.

179
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,310
Have you never

180
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,630
made a wish on your birthdays?

181
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,910
My birthday...

182
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,630
My father always forgot about it

183
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,460
He'd always say,

184
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,870
"I'll make it up to you next time."

185
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,220
But he'd always forget again.

186
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,950
It turns out

187
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,670
Glasses has a miserable past.

188
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,710
Come to think about it,

189
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,470
the biggest wish I had back then was

190
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,670
to have cake on my birthday.

191
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,140
Tong,

192
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,750
I'll celebrate your birthdays with you every year.

193
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,390
You can have as much birthday cake as you wish.

194
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,310
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,950
Don't mention it.

196
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,910
Ja...Jack,

197
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,470
what's happening?

198
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,550
I got the rosewood powder box

199
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,790
when I had to complete

200
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,270
the task of horse carriage for the first time.

201
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,670
It seems this rosewood powder box

202
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,310
is a tool to connect the outside world.

203
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,390
Dear Rui, my daughter,

204
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,150
how are you?

205
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,150
I miss you a lot,

206
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,830
and my health is declining.

207
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,750
Please complete the task soon

208
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,350
and return home soon.

209
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,190
From Tong Hui.

210
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,020
Rui?

211
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,470
Who is Rui?

212
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,430
If I pass the message to her,

213
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,150
her memory might come back.

214
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,270
It's okay. If I die, I die.

215
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,150
I set her up once.

216
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,900
I can't get her in trouble again.

217
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,630
But how do I pass the message to her?

218
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,430
If I give it to her directly,

219
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,710
I'll be exposed.

220
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,230
What's with your leg?

221
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,510
Nothing.

222
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,510
It happens when I think.

223
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,030
Then...let's continue.

224
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,030
We're almost out of dares.

225
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,550
I'll make some new ones.

226
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,270
Let's drink.

227
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,190
Drink up, Tong.

228
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,830
I'm done.

229
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,790
Let's continue.

230
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,660
I'll choose...

231
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,110
dare.

232
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,150
What's wrong, Si Yan?

233
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,510
You're so slow.

234
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,830
She wants you to pick truth.

235
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,270
What does it say?

236
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,020
If you could go back in time,

237
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,110
when would you want to return?

238
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,710
Provide the place.

239
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,870
It's a bad question.

240
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,830
Get another one.

241
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,910
Don't say that, Xiu.

242
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,350
Maybe Yi

243
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,310
wants to answer this question.

244
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,950
How could you say that?

245
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,300
In the past,

246
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,030
I desperately wanted to return to

247
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,510
the battleground in Northland years ago.

248
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,589
But now,

249
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,230
I want to go back

250
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,790
to many places.

251
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,750
Let me help you.

252
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,790
Let go.

253
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,510
Please wait up, Your Highness.

254
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,670
What makeup and clothing does the First Lady like?

255
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,350
What color does she like?

256
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,350
Can you please tell me?

257
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,630
What happened?

258
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,110
I don't owe you anything anymore.

259
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,390
This is Mother's makeup preference.

260
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,310
These flowers are for you.

261
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,190
Si Yan?

262
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,150
Private garden, woodshed, and the backyard?

263
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,310
What did you do in these places?

264
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,310
Next round!

265
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,070
Let me spin the bottle, too.

266
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,430
Tong,

267
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,270
which one will you pick, Truth or Dare?

268
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,390
Tong is agile.

269
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,510
You should choose dare.

270
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,670
I'll help you.

271
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,590
A letter from my father?

272
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,150
Why does she have it?

273
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,630
Glasses,

274
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,230
don't look at me this way.

275
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,340
Tong,

276
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,950
you look pale.

277
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,030
What does it say?

278
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,910
It's nothing.

279
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,870
I'll drink as punishment.

280
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,070
Nice!

281
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,070
I feel a bit tipsy.

282
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,470
I'll get some air.

283
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,710
Let's drink a glass, too.

284
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,750
Cheers!

285
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,750
Drink! Drink!

286
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,950
Don't leave.

287
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,230
How come I never got to play?

288
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,590
I'll help you.

289
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,750
Finally!

290
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,430
I'll choose...

291
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,110
Miss Si Yan,

292
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,110
since you helped me last time,

293
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,470
let me return the favor.

294
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,910
Take off the poster of the contest
 to become Prince Xiu's wife.

295
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,870
No!

296
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,710
Si Yan,

297
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
you asked to play.

298
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,150
It's your turn now.

299
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,870
You'd better not chicken out.

300
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,870
I remember

301
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,070
I never made this dare.

302
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,580
Someone must have tampered with it.

303
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,110
Was it you,

304
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,910
Glasses?

305
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,620
Take the poster off!

306
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,870
Take it off!

307
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,070
Take it off!

308
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,870
Let me see who's gonna be my wife!

309
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,470
Here you go.

310
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,510
Who is it?

311
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,430
It's me!

312
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,190
I'll do that!

313
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,830
Wait here.

314
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,270
Have you heard?

315
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,790
The poster of the contest
 to become Prince Xiu's wife got taken off.

316
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,470
Really?

317
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,870
Who dared to do that?

318
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,950
I heard that it was a court lady in Makeup Service,

319
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,830
Si Yan.

320
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,100
Prince Xiu, you disappoint me.

321
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,710
It's all over!

322
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,870
Honey, you can sleep here tonight.

323
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,550
I disagree.

324
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,470
Do you think your opinion matters?

325
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,830
Father!

326
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,030
Xiu,

327
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,870
you either get married,

328
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,150
or

329
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,110
send the guard

330
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,220
away.

331
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,150
Your choice!

332
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,950
Your Majesty,

333
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,030
what's going on?

334
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,230
As you are busy,

335
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,470
please excuse me.

336
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,470
You can't leave. Come back here.

337
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,780
You!

338
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,030
Your Majesty,

339
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,430
easy on the words.

340
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,430
He's old enough

341
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,030
to behave better than that.

342
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,070
How about you let me handle this matter?

343
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,190
I have an idea.

344
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,990
What are you going to do?

345
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,750
Si Yan

346
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,550
is a maid in my Palace Makeup Service.

347
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,230
I'll do everything I can to solve the problem

348
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,030
for Your Majesty.

349
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,910
Boss,

350
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,870
how's the progress of my order?

351
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,390
I sold it at a higher price.

352
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,670
I ordered first!

353
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,550
How could you sell it to others without telling me?

354
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,030
I went to see you at your place,

355
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,510
but someone said you wanted to cancel the order.

356
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,150
Who said that?

357
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,540
I heard that this morning,

358
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,270
all hats in the market were sold out.

359
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,190
What are you going to do?

360
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,510
It's you!

361
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,870
Come with me to see Lady Cui now!

362
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,110
It's early in the morning.

363
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,990
Don't get mad.

364
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,870
Instead of bickering with me,

365
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,910
you'd better think about solving the problem.

366
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,350
Stop right there.

367
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,950
By the way,

368
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,470
I forgot to tell you that

369
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,270
you've only had

370
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,910
half a day till the deadline.

371
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,430
There's a lot!

372
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,550
Since we're investigating how Luna got

373
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,270
a scar on her face,

374
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,670
we need all the information.

375
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,950
I've gathered all the documents

376
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,870
about the East City fire cases

377
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,070
here.

378
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,630
I will stay up today

379
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,510
and go through them all.

380
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,180
Your Highness,

381
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,750
are you cold?

382
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,870
In your opinion,

383
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,750
is the marriage for Xiu a done deal?

384
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,950
Do you hope it works out

385
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,630
or not?

386
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,270
His Highness

387
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,910
is used to living a carefree life.

388
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,070
He's not gonna marry easily.

389
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,910
I think most likely it won't pan out.

390
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,180
Well said!

391
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,990
Here's your reward.

392
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

393
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,390
Why do you still look worried?

394
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,270
Are you worried that Si Yan

395
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,990
wants to marry Prince Xiu?

396
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,150
Impossible!

397
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,910
Si Yan and Xiu don't have a romantic relationship.

398
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,990
Si Yan doesn't like Xiu.

399
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,230
Then what's there to worry about?

400
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,510
Though Si Yan and Xiu don't have the intent,

401
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,190
because of the assassination,

402
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,070
Mother has wrong ideas of Si Yan.

403
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,950
She works in Palace Makeup Service.

404
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,300
I worry that she...

405
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,430
Your Highness, you're worried

406
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,070
that the First Lady wants to close the deal.

407
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,990
I'm leaving.

408
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,710
Prince Bao has just left the picture,

409
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,910
now Prince Xiu is involved.

410
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,990
Prince Yi got

411
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,790
a rocky love life.

412
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,750
This can't do.

413
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,870
I can't lose it.

414
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,350
I should be the strongest shield for my master.

415
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,430
Si Yan?

416
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,750
Si Yan?

417
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,590
Your Highness,

418
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,390
are you here for Si Yan?

419
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,670
Or should I say...

420
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,590
Prince Xiu's Lady?

421
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,710
Don't say that.

422
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,870
They're not married yet.

423
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,750
Where is she?

424
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,390
She went to town to buy hats.

425
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,590
My lady, take your time to browse the store.

426
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,310
We have the high-quality fabric in the store.

427
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,150
Boss,

428
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,870
Do you have black tulle?

429
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,150
What bad timing!

430
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,550
The black tulle in the store

431
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,190
has just been ordered.

432
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,270
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,990
My lady,

434
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,710
aren't you the one who took off the poster last night?

435
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,870
You've got the wrong person.

436
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,750
It's not me.

437
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,270
I see that Your Highness

438
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,830
wants to keep a low profile.

439
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,390
I understand. Totally.

440
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,470
Yes.

441
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,470
For your current status,

442
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,500
using

443
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,190
purple cotton twill as an alternative

444
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,750
is the most suitable.

445
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,710
A bolt costs only 2, 333 coins.

446
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,030
What?

447
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,870
2, 333 coins?

448
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,510
I get it.

449
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,740
It's too cheap

450
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,350
to match

451
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,910
your superior status.

452
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,230
How about...

453
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,620
check this one out.

454
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,990
Silk satin from Jiangnan.

455
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,460
6,666 coins.

456
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,590
And this one,

457
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,510
Suzhou brocade,

458
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,150
8, 886 coins.

459
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,580
Boss,

460
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,630
look at my head.

461
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,470
Do you think I have a big head?

462
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,430
My lady's head is just the right size.

463
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,870
You're very beautiful.

464
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,670
How dare you treat me like a knucklehead?

465
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,350
I dared not.

466
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,510
That one! How much is linen?

467
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,230
She's about to become Prince Xiu's wife,

468
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,870
why's she so stingy?

469
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,350
Linen

470
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,070
is very absorbent,

471
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,470
strong and durable,

472
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,270
and a bolt

473
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,300
only costs 333 coins.

474
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,030
How much?

475
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,310
Miss,

476
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,430
if you want it,

477
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,630
I'll give it for free,

478
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,700
but could you promote the store

479
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,310
in the East Mansion?

480
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,990
Deal.

481
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,870
There is another bolt.

482
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,820
Miss,

483
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,340
you are a sharp haggler.

484
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,550
I'm clearing out the inventory for you.

485
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,550
Miss, don't forget to promote my shop, please.

486
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,630
I will!

487
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,910
Miss Si Yan,

488
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,390
the First Lady is asking for you.

489
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,630
The First Lady?

490
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,830
Sisters,

491
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,430
what is this all about?

492
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,990
Are the petals

493
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,670
mixed in with poison?

494
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,950
I know the First Lady doesn't like me,

495
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,190
but I am frustrated about that, too.

496
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,630
I don't want to be poisoned to death.

497
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,030
Tell me. What do you want?

498
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,070
What are you saying, Miss?

499
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,070
But...

500
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,350
I don't understand.

501
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,910
If the First Lady wants to see me,

502
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,710
I shouldn't go through the whole ordeal.

503
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,710
You seem to be prepping a concubine
before sending her to the Emperor.

504
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,470
You and I

505
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,390
haven't sat down to talk for a while.

506
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,630
I made some of

507
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,230
your favorite snacks.

508
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,590
Try them.

509
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,230
How do you like it?

510
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,910
Exactly the same.

511
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,070
Mother,

512
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,870
today...

513
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,590
I remember

514
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,750
when you were little,

515
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,150
both you and Teng liked marshmallow biscuits.

516
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,190
Time flies.

517
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,510
In a blink of an eye,

518
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,470
you're all grown up.

519
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,790
We can't go back to the past.

520
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,180
Mother,

521
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,750
I'll be like Teng,

522
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,030
dedicated

523
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,270
loyal, and responsible.

524
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,670
Please don't worry.

525
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,550
Please drink less, mother.

526
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,550
Your Highness,

527
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,540
the First Lady is happy today.

528
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,220
You should let her enjoy herself.

529
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,750
Why are you so happy today, mother?

530
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,030
Xiu's marriage has been set.

531
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,470
Isn't that great news for the East Mansion?

532
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,470
Yi,

533
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,590
you should follow suit.

534
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,550
Mother, I...

535
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,230
I heard

536
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,190
they'll consummate tonight.

537
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,990
I must get back to the Patrol Squadron

538
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,270
if you'll excuse me.

539
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,420
Hold on.

540
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,670
You haven't drunk the wine.

541
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,510
Why did you bring me here?

542
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,190
Please go in.

543
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:25,900
Si Yan,

544
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,590
why are you here?

545
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,350
Prince Xiu?

546
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,580
Hey!

547
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,830
Don't be shy, my lady.

548
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,350
Open the door!

549
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,620
It's no use.

550
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,070
They won't open the door.

551
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,110
Playing an old trick like consummation!

552
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,110
They're sick!

553
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,510
With a handsome, attractive,

554
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,550
wise and strong prince in front of you,

555
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,350
you don't budge.

556
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,470
Why? Do you like someone else?

557
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,310
Is it someone I know?

558
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,710
It's none of your business.

559
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,150
Does it matter who you marry?

560
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,510
I am a prince, too.

561
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,470
I have money, and I have time.

562
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,260
I've got no pressure to have a son.

563
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,150
How nice it is!

564
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,230
Being a maid in the Mansion

565
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,150
is not easy.

566
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,910
How about

567
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,550
us going with the flow?

568
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,670
We can put up a show and make father happy.

569
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,470
And I promise that I will treat you nicely.

570
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,070
After listening to you,

571
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,150
it seems like a good plan.

572
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,710
Then...

573
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,270
let's do it.

574
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,230
I'm kidding.

575
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,310
A gentleman doesn't take advantage of others.

576
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,590
Your Highness,

577
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,910
don't play games with me.

578
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,070
I'm only a maid,

579
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,910
and my only goal is to do my job well

580
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,110
and become Head Matron.

581
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,070
I don't think about anything else.

582
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,950
You have quite a goal!

583
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,590
So,

584
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,990
don't hinder me.

585
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,830
We have to cancel our engagement.

586
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,900
Can you

587
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,510
beg the King?

588
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,310
Do you think that I didn't?

589
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,070
To live my carefree life,

590
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,990
I even told a lie about having aphallia.

591
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,070
It was you

592
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,830
who screwed it up.

593
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,670
It's an accident.

594
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,030
Do you know why today

595
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,430
we are tricked here to consummate?

596
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,030
It's because I went to Father

597
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,070
and begged him.

598
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,710
He was furious,

599
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,700
so this is happening.

600
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,750
Then what do we do?

601
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,420
Am I really going to marry you?

602
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,900
What a huge loss for me!

603
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,590
Qi Xiu!

604
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,190
Why did you pinch me?

605
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,430
Because I am mad!

606
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,550
Your Highness,

607
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,150
what do we do now?

608
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,670
Father cares about the fall hunt a lot.

609
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,070
Whoever is recognized as the first hunter

610
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,870
can make a plea.

611
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,030
All I have to do is get the first hunt

612
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,990
and then I can ask the King

613
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,070
to cancel our engagement.

614
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,230
Before that,

615
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,350
all you need to do is cooperate with me

616
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,430
and act accordingly.

617
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,580
But you must keep this a secret.

618
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,030
You can't tell anyone,

619
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,230
not even Qi Yi.

620
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,230
Why would I tell him?

621
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,700
So stubborn.

622
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,350
Fire!

623
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,950
There's fire!

624
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,950
Help, anyone?

625
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,310
What happened?

626
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,070
Your Highness,

627
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,620
I found

628
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,670
someone jumping into the courtyard

629
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,190
and then the area by the fence was on fire.

630
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,150
Who broke into the East Mansion at night?

631
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,710
The timing is perfect!

632
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,550
Yi is too petty.

633
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,470
There's an assassin.

634
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,470
Hurry.

635
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,470
Hurry.

636
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,750
I'm terribly sorry.

637
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,830
I didn't mean it.

638
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,310
It's alright.

639
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,630
Perfect.

640
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,830
I'll get changed.

641
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:57,790
Xiu,

642
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,670
an assassin broke in and set a fire.

643
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,590
Da brought guards to check the east wing.

644
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,550
Go investigate the east wing with me.

645
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,630
Why are you pretending?

646
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,470
Didn't you do it?

647
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,790
The rosewood powder box!

648
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,670
It's been three months since the accident.

649
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,070
Your body can't hold up any longer.

650
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,470
You must finish the task ASAP.

651
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,350
Signing the contract with the gaming company was my idea.

652
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,270
It's the only way the game can operate,

653
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,550
but now

654
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,550
Si Zheng is blocking me from controlling the game

655
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,980
because of his daughter.

656
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,630
I'm losing control of the game

657
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,150
and can only use this to contact you.

658
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,110
You must leave the game soon.

659
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,350
I've almost completed my mission.

660
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,590
I will return.

661
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,390
Could my target

662
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,310
have something to do with lotus?

663
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,750
I'll pick truth.

664
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,030
Select people who fit the descriptors listed

665
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,950
and rate them by appearance.

666
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,150
The highest score is 10.

667
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,710
You're getting a free ride.

668
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,350
Prince Da is the oldest of all.

669
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,870
Tough as old boots.

670
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,990
Three points.

671
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,310
Tong...

672
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,030
He has very nice teeth.

673
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,230
Pale lips and teeth.

674
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,510
Four points.

675
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,070
Have you gained weight, Si Yan?

676
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,550
Worry-free and grow fat.

677
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,230
Five points.

678
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,870
Prince Bao has too much worry these days.

679
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,990
Always looks grim.

680
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,430
Five points.

681
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,510
Prince Xiu is

682
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,510
like the willow, like the breeze.

683
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,710
Five points.

684
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,350
The last one is

685
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,310
Prince Yi.

686
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,630
Short but vigorous. Six points.

687
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,230
I am not.
