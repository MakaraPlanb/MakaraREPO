1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,640
The Qixi monthly exam officially started.

3
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm almost done with the look.

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,960
There's only one most important thing to do.

5
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,480
TikTok beauty blogger Chestnut here.

6
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,490
Welcome to the show.

7
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,200
Look at me.

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
Isn't my look unique today?

9
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,880
How is our often sold-out
 pearlescent powder shadow

10
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,210
produced?

11
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,520
Aren't you curious?

12
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,600
Today,

13
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,040
I'll demonstrate

14
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,440
the process of making it.

15
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
With such a pearlescent eyeshadow pencil,

16
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,200
you can have big watery eyes.

17
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Prince Xiu.

18
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Guard Yun.

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
Where are you going in a hurry?

20
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,970
Your Highness,

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
Palace Makeup Service is having a monthly exam.

22
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,400
We are going there to judge.

23
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,770
Go on.

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
A group of men as makeup judges?

25
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,079
Interesting.

26
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Let's check it out.

27
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
Here, the contestant

28
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,040
uses orange-centered makeup

29
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,770
to accentuate the cheekbones.

30
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,839
Thicker lip gloss is applied

31
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
to emphasize lip makeup.

32
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,120
As for her,

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
light purple is the base color.

34
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,250
Eye makeup is accentuated,

35
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,520
making her look sparkling,

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,810
charming,

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
sophisticated, and chic.

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,440
My wife

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
works in the kitchen.

40
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,970
She always smells greasy and smoky.

41
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
They smell nice.

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
I love it.

43
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,360
I can't tell if a woman

44
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,560
wears makeup or not,

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,000
but I like this.

46
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,720
It lightens them.

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,640
I think Jade's red lips

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,690
look good.

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
If she wears this makeup,

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,680
she'll love it.

51
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,290
The name sounds cool, too.

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
It's called "the romantic makeup."

53
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,680
My lord,

54
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,800
failing to replace the medicine

55
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
is my mistake.

56
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
That maid is for sure weird.

57
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
Shall we find a chance to get rid of her?

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,650
It's okay.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The master said

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,159
to keep her for other purposes.

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,000
You messed up big time.

62
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
If anything goes wrong,

63
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,880
we'll blame it on that maid

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,960
and make her a scapegoat.

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,970
Let's cast our vote.

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
The longer you look at them, the prettier.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,880
First place.

68
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,490
How did Si Yan do?

69
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Right here.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Neither good nor bad,

71
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,760
but yeah, I passed.

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,730
You seem over-joyed.

73
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
I cast my vote for you.

75
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,800
The pearlescent eyeshadow pencil

76
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,680
is interesting.

77
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,760
You have good eyes.

78
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,640
Thank you very much, Your Highness.

79
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,000
But I wonder where Yi

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
and Bao went.

81
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Based on their taste,

82
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,320
they must like you...

83
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,640
...your design the best.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,800
Please don't tease me, Your Highness.

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm just a nobody

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
in those two nobles' eyes.

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,880
Miss Min, what brings you here?

88
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,800
Prince Yi rarely asks me out.

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,050
I want to look my best to impress him.

90
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,440
My lady,

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,320
the winner is HuYing's

92
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,880
romantic makeup look.

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,290
I want her to do my makeup.

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
What's going on?

95
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,360
She's got masters on her back again and again.

96
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,000
What a showoff!

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,960
Screw the eyeshadow pencil!

98
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,000
You are disparaging Si Yan again.

99
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll take you to Lady Cui.

100
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,960
You have a big heart

101
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,480
to speak for your love rival.

102
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,080
Does Si Yan appreciate you?

103
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Hu Ying!

104
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,320
Get up.

105
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Are you okay?

106
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,760
Si Yan,

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
it's my fault.

108
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,280
I shouldn't have misunderstood you.

109
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Stop crying.

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,440
If you ruin your makeup,

111
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll have to redo it.

112
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you forgive me?

113
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,600
Hey, you two.

114
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
It's okay

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
to play sisters in front of others.

116
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,010
But don't do that in front of me. It's disgusting.

117
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,040
You always go behind my back.

118
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,080
You're disgusting.

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
If it were not for Prince Yi's support,

120
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,760
how could you have participated in the contest

121
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
and entered the Makeup Service?

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
If it were not for Prince Bao,

123
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
how would you have convinced everyone?

124
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,800
You were a lowly maid 
who fast-tracked your way up by kissing up.

125
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,200
You are the least qualified
 to talk about fair and square.

126
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
Perhaps you've done many shameful deeds

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,330
behind the scenes.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,760
Who knows what you did in exchange of

129
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,760
the eyeshadow pencil?

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
How dare you slap me?

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,680
Excuse me.

132
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,320
You deserve a beating.

133
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Why don't you look at yourself

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
instead of staring at others all day?

135
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Do you think no one knows

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,890
you bribed Director Hua?

137
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,640
I... I...

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
You what?

139
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,560
I haven't forgotten what you did to me last time.

140
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,880
How dare you come on at me again?

141
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
I guess I've been too nice for too long.

142
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
I am getting a bit rusty at slapping.

143
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Bring it on.

144
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Si Yan,

145
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
murder is punishable by death.

146
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,880
Help!

147
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,250
Help!

148
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,200
Help!

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
Stop screaming.

150
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,840
The well is not very deep at all.

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,280
Don't worry.

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,640
Someone will come for you in two hours.

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,930
Before that happens,

154
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,560
think about what you did.

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,400
Si Yan!

156
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,840
Let's leave.

157
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
Help me!

158
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,760
Help me out!

159
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,200
Si Yan,

160
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,760
pull me up.

161
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
How much is it?

162
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,960
What's going on?

163
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:56,840
Where's she?

164
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,320
Let's check inside.

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,760
Let's go.

166
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,960
The setting in the game is rigid indeed.

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,930
NPC characters

168
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,720
can't tell if a female is disguised as a male or not.

169
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
It seems that

170
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,040
I don't need to worry about exposing my identity.

171
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,080
Your Highness,

172
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,680
I've arranged everything.

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,560
If it goes well,

174
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll reward you.

175
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,810
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,890
You little brat,

177
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,400
I'll beat you to death today.

178
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Get lost and go

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
as far as you can.

180
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll kill you.

181
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,280
I'll kill you.

182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,400
I must beat you to death today.

183
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,400
Mom...

184
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,040
Mom...

185
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,560
I am not your mom.

186
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,130
Your mom died long ago.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,010
Over the years,

188
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,400
and for the sake of the old master,

189
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
I've provided you with food and shelter.

190
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,760
But now that

191
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,920
the old master died,

192
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,920
I don't have food to spare for you.

193
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,800
Get lost.

194
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,920
Leave now.

195
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,120
Are you not going?

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,800
Today, I'll...

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,490
I'll beat you to death.

198
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:58,880
Stop it.

199
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,680
Who are you?

200
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,040
It's none of your business.

201
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,360
Come.

202
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,960
Who I am

203
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
is not important,

204
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,370
but...

205
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Alright, alright.

206
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,000
Stop making a scene.

207
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,080
Let's go home.

208
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,200
May I treat you to a drink?

209
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,440
What do you say?

210
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,330
After you.

211
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,120
You first.

212
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,600
My girls,

213
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
tonight

214
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,880
is the night!

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Once you claim the title in the Oiran election,

216
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,680
prosperity and wealth await.

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
Yes, Ma'am.

218
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,080
Who is she?

219
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,680
Why did she get it?

220
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,320
Miss,

221
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,050
you look so beautiful.

222
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,210
Are you also here for the Oiran election?

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,080
Why?

224
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Miss,

225
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,400
you haven't told me your name.

226
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Luna.

227
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,040
Who is she?

228
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,280
Who is she?

229
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
She finally showed up.

230
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
Go with the plan.

231
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,400
Si Yan,

232
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
This is the reward for clearing
 the monthly exam task in the system.

233
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,560
The reward is pretty good.

234
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,130
The gold coins I earned earlier

235
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,440
can finally be put to use.

236
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,280
Wow! There are many beautiful outfits.

237
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Insufficient fund?

238
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Are you kidding me?

239
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,080
The hard-earned money

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
is only enough for a dudou.

241
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,210
If you can't buy it,

242
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,490
you can rent it.

243
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,930
But

244
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
you need to return it by midnight.

245
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,280
How do I look?

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,920
Do I look nice?

247
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,330
The powder is thin and translucent.

248
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,080
The lip gloss is just right.

249
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
Overall, it looks great.

250
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Yet,

251
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,320
you might want to work on the details.

252
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,920
As a good butler,

253
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,280
all you need to say is that I look nice and gorgeous.

254
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,960
That's it.

255
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,680
By the way,

256
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,240
why don't you wear the makeup you designed,

257
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,280
the grape blossoms with sparkles?

258
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,880
This makeup look

259
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
is not permitted on anyone else.

260
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,960
Yes, my lady.

261
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,000
Today is the first time

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Brother Yi and I are going out alone.

263
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,960
Do you think he'll like it?

264
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,720
Lowly maids like us have no way

265
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,080
of knowing what Prince Yi likes or dislikes.

266
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,360
Is that so?

267
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,810
I've heard some gossip

268
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,800
through the grapevine under this roof.

269
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,730
Take the advice.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
You should know your place

271
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,930
so as not to stir up more rumors

272
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,610
and ruin the reputation of the princes.

273
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,690
Yes, my lady.

274
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,170
That is the makeup for

275
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,120
heart-broken girls.

276
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
If I put in on myself,

277
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,530
it'll bring bad luck.

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,840
Is there anything fun to do today?

279
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,450
I barely take a vacation.

280
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,400
Let's have an outing.

281
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,040
Qixi is the Chinese Valentine's Day.

282
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,050
There are games specially arranged

283
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,760
like riddles and setting off sky lanterns.

284
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,359
Sounds great.

285
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
I haven't gone shopping for so long.

286
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,050
I'll go shopping with Lan Miao later

287
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,000
and eat as I please.

288
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Si Yan,

289
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,280
are you free tonight?

290
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Why do you ask?

291
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,000
Actually,

292
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,440
I want to tell you something.

293
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,520
I'll wait for you

294
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,970
at the Lantern Festival tonight.

295
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,760
Your Highness,

296
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,760
can it not be tonight?

297
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,200
I have other plans tonight.

298
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,050
I'll be waiting

299
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,320
until you come.

300
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,160
Shouldn't you be pleased

301
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,530
when someone asks you out?

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,680
Why do you look like

303
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,080
you're having a dilemma?

304
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,760
I... I am not.

305
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,130
I get it.

306
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Data shows that

307
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,450
you have

308
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,080
never had a boyfriend before.

309
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
Feeling awkward is normal.

310
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,450
Don't be afraid.

311
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,690
If you need help,

312
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,440
I can provide you

313
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
with references anytime.

314
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,040
I am a beauty blogger

315
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
who has over a million fans.

316
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
I have nothing to fear.

317
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
How can I be a relationship virgin

318
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,810
like you said?

319
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,360
Your database has a glitch.

320
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,240
Is that so?

321
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,850
Miss Min, your makeup looks very unique.

322
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,600
It's the look I put on just for the Lantern Festival,

323
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,200
the grape blossoms with sparkles.

324
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
You lost, Miss Min.

325
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,960
It's because you are so good at it.

326
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,000
Brother Teng used to always say that

327
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,330
since you were young, you've been good at chess.

328
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,690
Did you let me win on purpose today?

329
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Prince Teng overrated my skills.

330
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
He never gave undeserved praises.

331
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,370
Prince Teng was always thoughtful.

332
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,050
Perhaps...

333
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,600
Perhaps he was worried that I would be humiliated

334
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,610
by my poor chess skills.

335
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,970
I met him when we were young.

336
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,850
When we met for the first time,

337
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,570
we both had feelings for each other.

338
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,160
We both enjoyed riding horses on the grassland,

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
reciting poems and singing duets,

340
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
and drinking tea while incense burned.

341
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,730
Every time I was with Prince Teng,

342
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,240
he was very caring for me.

343
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
We liked each other.

344
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,050
It sounds like

345
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,280
you have a deep affection for him.

346
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,720
It must be very tough on you

347
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,320
these days.

348
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,600
I will find a chance to explain to my father

349
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,680
and call off the engagement.

350
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,320
No!

351
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,960
I mean

352
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,120
the marriage between the East Mansion
 and the Min family is of great importance,

353
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,840
so we can't break it off

354
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,760
because of our feelings.

355
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,970
Recently, many incidents took place
 in the East Mansion.

356
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,920
I don't know

357
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,600
if it was the Northland

358
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
or someone else.

359
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,120
Please be cautious, Miss Min.

360
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,720
Don't get involved.

361
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,280
I lost the person.

362
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,480
You may leave.

363
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
How come your maid

364
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,640
is not with you today?

365
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,880
Peach, she...

366
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,360
May I ask you one thing, my lady?

367
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,850
Why don't you use your true identity

368
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,880
to meet Prince Da at Qixi Festival?

369
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,040
You don't know anything.

370
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,720
Prince Da is afraid of women.

371
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
He's hard to approach
even if I use my true identity.

372
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,560
Needless to say that

373
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,960
you shouldn't put all the eggs in one basket.

374
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,240
With the power of the First Lady,

375
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
I am bound to marry Prince Yi

376
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
and be restricted everywhere.

377
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,440
As a maid,

378
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,360
I have more freedom.

379
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,090
But my lady,

380
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,720
if I meet Prince Yi by myself,

381
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,730
I'm afraid that I might give myself away.

382
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,720
You just need to memorize what I taught you well

383
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,000
and make Prince Yi fall in love with you.

384
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
Today is Qixi.

385
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
It's her first time coming to East City,

386
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,680
so I gave her permission to look around town.

387
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,520
Brother Yi,

388
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,440
why did you ask about her?

389
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,720
Was she your maid

390
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,000
when she was little?

391
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,160
When she was seven,

392
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,360
she came to the Min family.

393
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,680
She's been accompanying me ever since.

394
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,960
On the day of the Flower Feast,

395
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,610
she seemed to have arrived late.

396
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,560
She went back to fetch
 a set of changing clothes for me.

397
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,570
Miss Min, have you ever suspected

398
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,090
that she tampered with First Lady's reins?

399
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,720
Brother Yi, what did you just say?

400
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,800
It didn't matter.

401
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I was just asking.

402
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's go.

403
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Shall we go and enjoy the view?

404
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,160
May I ask

405
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,480
what you said to the woman

406
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,880
to change her mind?

407
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
I just calculated the numbers for her.

408
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
A child eats 70 lbs of rice a year.

409
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,120
It'll be 700-900 lbs of rice in ten years.

410
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,280
He will be able to work in ten years.

411
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,760
He'll be able to pay back in one year.

412
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
It's better to keep him as a house dog

413
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,000
than to drive him out and come back

414
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,040
like a wolf to take revenge.

415
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
If she keeps the child,

416
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,370
he might take care of the house.

417
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,120
Doing that

418
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,930
is like pushing the child into the fire pit.

419
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
Who is the fire pit for whom?

420
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
It's hard to say.

421
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,960
That child is not simple.

422
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,840
He has fire in his eyes.

423
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,170
Even if he was raised like a dog,

424
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
he would still have desires.

425
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,480
As long he has desires,

426
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,690
he won't lose himself.

427
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,840
Sooner or later,

428
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,930
he will become his own master.

429
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,760
Your perspective

430
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
is very insightful.

431
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,610
I'm inspired.

432
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,320
It seems that getting the Oiran's Tear is

433
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,570
much harder than I thought.

434
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,930
Look over there.

435
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
What are we doing later?

436
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,680
Let's eat some delicious food.

437
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,960
Look here.

438
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,040
You startled me.

439
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,760
Let's go over there.

440
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,690
What is this?

441
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,120
Let's go over there.

442
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,800
Let's go.

443
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
Take a guess and take a look.

444
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,120
It's yours if you guess it right.

445
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
A spider hangs from the sky.

446
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,600
Guess an idiom.

447
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Seven hands and eight feet?

448
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,680
No.

449
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,600
What is it then?

450
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,120
Joy falls from the sky.

451
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,960
Are you also here to have fun?

452
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,210
You changed your outfit!

453
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,410
It's my job to retrieve the necessary information

454
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,960
for Miss Si Yan.

455
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,000
How loyal you are!

456
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,880
But,

457
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,600
but why is it "joy falls from the sky?"

458
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,560
What's the joy of seeing spiders?

459
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,000
It's said that spiders can bring joy.

460
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,360
So, joy falls from the sky!

461
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,690
It's a pun, right?

462
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,280
Yes, you're right.

463
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Here is a gift for you.

464
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Here you go.

465
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,090
You won it.

466
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,720
I'm merely solving problems for you.

467
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,690
It's my job,

468
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,730
so I can't take credits.

469
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,080
If I tell you to take it, take it.

470
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,520
Stop the nonsense.

471
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,360
Oh, I forgot...

472
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,280
I'll give you a day off today.

473
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,520
You are not the butler.

474
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,640
You are Xiao Li.

475
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,210
I am not "Miss."

476
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm just Si Yan.

477
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,040
Let's shop and eat together.

478
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,000
What do you say?

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,960
Xiao Li?

480
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,840
You see that those Misses and Masters

481
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,040
all have

482
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,160
a Xiao Wang or Xiao Bao by their side.

483
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,280
It sounds nice.

484
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,200
I also thought that

485
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,840
your name Jack

486
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,080
seems very strange at this time.

487
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,920
Do as the locals do.

488
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,130
Xiao Li.

489
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,610
Do you like it?

490
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,000
The name is just a code.

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,960
Whatever floats your boat.

492
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,560
Si Yan,

493
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:29,880
hurry over.

494
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,840
Come and help me with the riddle.

495
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,330
What is it?

496
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,280
This.

497
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,080
Come. Take a guess and have a look.

498
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,720
Here it is.

499
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
Beautiful lanterns.

500
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,850
What word becomes shorter when you add

501
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,400
two letters to it?

502
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,040
If you add the letters "er" to the word "short,"

503
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
it will become "shorter" indeed.

504
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,160
The answer is "short."

505
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,760
Congratulations, you're right.

506
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,610
Bravo.

507
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah, how could you have guessed it right?

508
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,240
Take it.

509
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,400
Please help us guess one.

510
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,960
Yes, please.

511
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,530
And this one.

512
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay, okay.

513
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Not to worry.

514
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,200
I'll solve it one by one.

515
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,000
Brother Bao.

516
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Brother Xiu!

517
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,640
Are you looking for

518
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,680
Si Yan?

519
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,120
How do you know?

520
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,640
For the Qixi Festival,

521
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,840
are you only giving her this?

522
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
I saw that everyone is gifting this,

523
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,160
so I did the same thing.

524
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
When you choose a gift for a girl,

525
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,520
you have to know what she likes.

526
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
I can only help you this much.

527
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:58,960
Yun Li.

528
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,120
This lantern is so beautiful.

529
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,720
Thank you.

530
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,130
Don't mention it.

531
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,720
I finally got it.

532
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,400
I've wanted a lantern badly.

533
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,040
Let's go.

534
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
Miss, please don't leave yet.

535
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,330
Since you're so good with riddles,

536
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,240
do you want to participate in our ultimate final?

537
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,160
Ultimate final?

538
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,680
Right.

539
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,720
What do we do?

540
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
You won all his lanterns.

541
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
Now he remembers you.

542
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,440
I am a straight-A student,

543
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,040
I have a secret weapon.

544
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,080
I'm in.

545
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:41,970
Alright.

546
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,000
Here you go.

547
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
Why is it these three pictures again?

548
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
This game is trying to trick me again.

549
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,560
I won't choose the auspicious green clouds.

550
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,960
The miniature version of the man in black

551
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,320
doesn't seem like a good thing.

552
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,920
This one.

553
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,320
Okay.

554
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,000
I chose this one.

555
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,880
Okay.

556
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:22,680
Here.

557
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,480
I am a helping verb that gives people ability.
 What am I?

558
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,040
I am the only pronoun that always capitalizes.
 What am I?

559
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,640
I am a four-letter verb that owns a lot.
 What am I?

560
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,200
I am a possessive adjective that has four letters.
 What am I?

561
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,600
What can fill a room but take up no space?

562
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,560
It's too hard.

563
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,640
I have to guess a word for each sentence.

564
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,520
I only figured out that the first word is "can."

565
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,560
Am I right?

566
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,240
Si Yan,

567
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,120
this is a hidden task,

568
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,450
so I can't help you.

569
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,210
You must know the answer

570
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,520
and just aren't telling me.

571
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,080
Then I'll check out Forever Young first.

572
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,440
Let's go.

573
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,520
Sure.

574
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,240
So this is the famous Forever Young makeup shop.

575
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,690
Let's go inside.

576
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,880
I hate that we get paid so little monthly.

577
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,130
Otherwise,

578
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,640
I won't bother choosing.

579
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,120
I'll just buy all the lip gloss.

580
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,080
Back then,

581
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,480
I could buy the shop out

582
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,680
without a blink.

583
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,080
What nonsense was that?

584
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,880
Though I can't afford it,

585
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,800
I can at least try it on.

586
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,360
Si Yan.

587
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,200
Your Highness.

588
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,000
I knew you'd be here.

589
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
This system

590
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,320
has got everything planned for me.

591
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,720
What is the system?

592
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
It is guessing the riddles.

593
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
I am very good at riddles.

594
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,120
Really?

595
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,480
Then can you help me with the riddles?

596
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,000
I am a helping verb that gives people ability.
 What am I?

597
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,080
It's the word "can."

598
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,610
I am the only pronoun that always capitalizes.
 What am I?

599
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,720
It's "I."

600
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,050
I am a four-letter verb that owns a lot.
 What am I?

601
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,159
It's the word "have."

602
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,600
Makes sense.

603
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,360
I am a possessive adjective that has four letters.
 What am I?

604
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,610
It's the word "your."

605
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,170
What can fill a room but take up no space?

606
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,280
It's love.

607
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,360
"Can I have your love?"

608
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,239
Si Yan,

609
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,880
there's something I want to tell you.

610
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,850
Could you leave us for a moment?

611
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,360
Is there anything you like?

612
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,000
I like this one.

613
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,480
I think that one suits you.

614
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,920
Si Yan,

615
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,880
This is... for you.

616
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,240
What is this?

617
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,730
The spider of joy.

618
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you for watching the lanterns with me.

619
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,800
Brother Yi!

620
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,200
let's go over there.

621
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,760
Brother Yi!

622
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,800
Brother Yi!

623
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,960
Brother Yi!

624
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
Brother Yi!

625
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,680
Brother Yi!

626
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,330
Brother Yi!

627
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,280
Brother Yi!

628
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,720
Brother Yi!

629
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,000
Please leave the mask on and hear me out.

630
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,480
I...

631
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,480
I...

632
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,770
Just a second.

633
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,160
I have been searching for someone

634
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,200
who I can see right away

635
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,680
in the vast crowd

636
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,000
and whose voice is all I hear

637
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,320
in the noisy world.

638
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,200
When we are happy,

639
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,320
we embrace at will.

640
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,920
When we are sad,

641
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
we hold each other's hands.

642
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,090
Not everyone

643
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,610
dares to pursue a girl.

644
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,440
You suddenly

645
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,610
walked into my life,

646
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,040
so dazzling that I dared not to approach,

647
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,650
just like now.

648
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,330
I want to tell you...

649
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,370
Don't tell me the next sentence

650
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
is "I like you!"

651
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,480
This must be the love letter

652
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,690
you wrote to Little Wan.

653
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,610
People who don't know you

654
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
might think you are confessing to someone.

655
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
I am not an indecisive person,

656
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,680
but when I am with you,

657
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,560
my brain goes blank.

658
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,440
So...

659
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,120
So...

660
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,770
So I asked

661
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,320
Brother Xiu to help me write this.

662
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,440
Si Yan,

663
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,160
I like you.

664
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,040
Brother Yi!

665
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,360
Who is Si Yan?
