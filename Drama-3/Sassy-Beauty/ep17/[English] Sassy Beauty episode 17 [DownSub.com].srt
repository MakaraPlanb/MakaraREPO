1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,620
The King ordered to cancel

3
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,110
the engagement of Si Yan and Prince Xiu.

4
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,230
Why isn't she sad at all?

5
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,590
As the old saying goes, "Extreme joy begets sorrow."

6
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,710
You're right.

7
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,310
No one wants to cry in front of others.

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,910
Moreover,

9
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,110
as maids,

10
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,070
who we marry

11
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,350
is determined by our masters.

12
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,470
This year's Dendrobium Miyakei didn't flower well.

13
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,070
The Marvel-of-Peru has dried,

14
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,270
so the rouge made from it

15
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,820
will render poor colors.

16
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,910
If only there's Mountain Pomegranate!

17
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,350
Mountain Pomegranate is rare.

18
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,270
I heard

19
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,590
the rouge made from it

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,150
is only for the Second Lady.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,510
Your Highness.

22
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,950
Stop.

23
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,790
You there,

24
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,150
come with me.

25
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,470
I have a few extra Mountain Pomegranate
 in my garden

26
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,180
for Palace Makeup Service.

27
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,430
Thank you, Prince Yi.

28
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,910
If you want to see me, just say so.

29
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,110
Don't use the excuse of giving plants.

30
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,310
If you don't have them,

31
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,590
what do I do?

32
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,310
If I don't have it in my garden,

33
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,070
I'm afraid that

34
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,430
you can't find it anywhere in East City.

35
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,910
How cocky!

36
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,790
Prince Yi is despotic.

37
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,230
Mountain Pomegranate is delicate and rare,

38
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,470
but he gave it away so easily.

39
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,829
Palace Makeup Service got lucky.

40
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,150
But...

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,230
since when did Prince Yi

42
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,590
care about makeup products?

43
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,430
So mountain pomegranate
 is a kind of rhododendron.

44
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,470
I thought it's rarer than that!

45
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,550
It has many effects.

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,700
If it's taken orally,

47
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,380
it stops bleeding and detoxifies.

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,990
Taking it often

49
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,470
is good for women.

50
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,950
A bush of mountain pomegranate
gives thousands of flowers,

51
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,270
squeezing against the railing.

52
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,470
It looks like a red piece of cloth cut into pieces

53
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,910
and clustered as one.

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,430
They sway with the breeze as if dancing,

55
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,910
while the wind carries the aroma far.

56
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,590
So...

57
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,430
The morning dews on the flowers
 are like makeup...

58
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,110
Hearing the person you like recite a poem

59
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,670
feels so sweet.

60
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,660
Finally, it's done.

61
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,030
How come it feels like it's missing something?

62
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,860
No tasks,

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,390
no rewards,

64
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,630
and no nagging from Jack.

65
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,950
What's a task?

66
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,150
Who is Jack?

67
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,550
He's a friend of mine.

68
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,270
I haven't seen him for a long time.

69
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,670
Then

70
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,670
I'll send Wang to find him.

71
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,150
Don't bother.

72
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,790
You can't find him.

73
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,510
He'll come to see me.

74
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,390
He'll come to you?

75
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,230
This old friend of yours

76
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,390
surely puts on airs.

77
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,750
What good timing!

78
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,220
Help me find a guy

79
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,470
named Jack in East City.

80
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,750
Jack?

81
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,710
Is there a Jack

82
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,710
in East City?

83
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,630
It's okay.

84
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,710
He's my friend,

85
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,750
and I'll look for him myself.

86
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,030
Please get back to work.

87
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,070
I'll get going.

88
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,500
Your Highness,

89
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,550
should I find the guy?

90
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,470
Congratulations, Prince Da,

91
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,660
for winning the best hunter title
 in the autumn hunt.

92
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,910
What did the King

93
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,390
give you as the reward?

94
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,870
How about marrying you?

95
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,510
I'll buy your contract out for you.

96
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,630
Why?

97
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,540
Do you regret it?

98
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,550
When I met you for the first time

99
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,510
at the posting station,

100
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,070
I knew you were the one I'm searching for.

101
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,310
About me disguised as a man,

102
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,230
you didn't blame me for deceiving you.

103
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,300
How would I regret anything?

104
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,310
I will never let you down.

105
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,580
But right now,

106
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,950
there's one thing more urgent

107
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,230
I need to plea to the King.

108
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,430
What is it?

109
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,710
Sources from the Mins reported

110
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,470
that the battle in Northland is tight.

111
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,870
East City will send more troops
 to the battleground.

112
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,500
Your Highness shall ask the King to make you

113
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
the commander-in-chief at once.

114
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,910
Supervise the war at the front line.

115
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,950
Perform military exploits.

116
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,990
Supervise the frontline battle,

117
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,950
perform military exploits,

118
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,750
and I'll marry you

119
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,750
as the crowned prince.

120
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,190
Don't worry, Miss Tong.

121
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,750
You bring me luck.

122
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,550
Your identity

123
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,470
and status don't matter.

124
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,350
As long as we team up,

125
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,230
we will dictate our destiny.

126
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,830
Qi Yi,

127
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,510
though you did not die,

128
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,430
it doesn't mean you'll always be lucky.

129
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,990
Being involved with the girl

130
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,310
brings you the spell of bad luck.

131
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,870
You won't live to see the end.

132
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,790
Nonsense!

133
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,990
How do you plan to thank me?

134
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,950
How about the Luoyang Red in your private garden?

135
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,900
Or the daisy spray mums as thank you gifts?

136
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,750
What for?

137
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,110
Are you playing dumb with me?

138
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,470
I haven't greeted father today.

139
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,670
I think we might have canceled the engagement

140
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,150
too hastily.

141
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,310
Si Yan

142
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,310
is pretty awesome.

143
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,590
Thanks, Brother Xiu.

144
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,350
What?

145
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,630
I didn't hear it clearly.

146
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,790
Thank you, Brother Xiu,

147
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,710
for not marrying her.

148
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,510
I came here today

149
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,790
because of the Linchuan Cliff ledger

150
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,110
you asked me to investigate.

151
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,710
I found something.

152
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,070
Let's hear it.

153
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,310
I searched every single

154
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,350
underground bank in East City.

155
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,550
Director Li is very sly.

156
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,580
He circulated the money

157
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,710
through more than ten different

158
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,100
underground banks and casinos.

159
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,350
Where'd the money go?

160
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,390
I heard that

161
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,550
he purchased food and fodder.

162
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,990
With that much money,

163
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,590
he's got a lot of food and fodder.

164
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,710
A director with little power

165
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,430
could do these things quietly

166
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
under our eyes without getting caught?

167
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,590
Unless...

168
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,510
You think someone higher-up was involved.

169
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,990
That's what I'm worried about.

170
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,950
That much food and fodder,

171
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,470
no matter where it goes,

172
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,780
will pose threat to East City.

173
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,260
Don't fret.

174
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,750
You have to watch out.

175
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,070
That Luna kept pestering you

176
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,270
trying to kill you.

177
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,590
Who is she?

178
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,790
There's some evidence,

179
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,790
but we don't know her identity yet.

180
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,550
Attachment, hatred, ignorance, grudge, and greed.

181
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,790
It must be one of these causes.

182
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,180
It's hard on you, Yi,

183
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,550
still caught deep in the vortex,

184
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,230
trying to figure everything out.

185
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,470
Brother Xiu.

186
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,740
Keep investigating where the food and fodder went.

187
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,990
Before obtaining solid evidence,

188
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,390
don't let the cat out of the bag.

189
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,030
I'll take care of it.

190
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,310
Don't worry.

191
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,350
How are things with Si Yan

192
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,510
going?

193
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,270
Oh, that?

194
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,590
Brother Xiu.

195
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,030
What are you saying?

196
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,070
Focus on your task.

197
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,990
So things are going well.

198
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,910
But as an older brother,

199
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,750
I must say

200
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,110
have a sense of urgency.

201
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,030
Please don't think

202
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,540
the King called off the engagement between us,

203
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,630
so everything will be fine.

204
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,590
There is still a long way ahead.

205
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,190
What do you do with Miss Min?

206
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,110
What will you say to the First Lady?

207
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,670
Father won't agree to it.

208
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,150
A maid and a prince?

209
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,630
It's not going to be so easy.

210
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,390
Enough, Brother Xiu.

211
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,470
Nagging like our father,

212
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,150
you imitated it so well.

213
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,630
Wang,

214
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,350
see him out.

215
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,510
I'm off.

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,710
Though the war in Northland is urgent,

217
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,790
Your Majesty has to take care of your health, too.

218
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,950
If you keep sighing and moaning,

219
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,350
and staying up the whole night,

220
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,390
my heart

221
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,790
will ache for you.

222
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,430
The Northland King

223
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,860
is always restless,

224
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,910
intruding on our north border again and again.

225
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,270
He always provokes war without cause

226
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,590
only to put the lives of innocent people in jeopardy.

227
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,710
My brother is stationed at the north border.

228
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,590
I'm sure he can stop the bandits.

229
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
Of course.

230
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,990
But,

231
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,110
don't you think something's wrong?

232
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,710
How does a little brute king

233
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,670
have enough food, fodder, and money

234
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,460
to initiate war all the time?

235
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,830
What brought you here, Prince Yi?

236
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,070
Greetings, my lady.

237
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,670
Go to the Makeup Service
 and fetch some calming incenses

238
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,550
to send to the King.

239
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,550
Yes.

240
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,270
While Wang was catching the assassin,

241
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,190
he startled Second Lady.

242
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,910
I came to apologize.

243
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,150
You are too kind, Prince Yi.

244
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,270
Just a few days ago,

245
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,590
you sent the bloody bird nests
 and wild ginseng to me.

246
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,950
I haven't had the chance to enjoy them.

247
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,630
Today Prince Yi came to visit in person.

248
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,470
You must have something else in mind.

249
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,030
If you'll allow me,

250
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,310
I want to ask one thing.

251
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,070
About the fires in Cloud Brothel three years ago,

252
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,990
do you still remember anything?

253
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,270
I've heard.

254
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,230
Luckily, I left early that day

255
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,430
and avoided the fires.

256
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,190
On that day,

257
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,950
was the top Courtesan Luna of Cloud Brothel there?

258
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,620
This ...

259
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,070
I'm unclear.

260
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,750
I also

261
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,270
just wanted to give back

262
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,230
by helping the girls there with ransoms.

263
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,700
I wasn't there for the show.

264
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,750
Everyone knows

265
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,990
you are a saint.

266
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,580
Lady Cui of Makeup Service said

267
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,390
there used to be a page boy at Makeup Service.

268
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,310
His name is Qing Yan.

269
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,150
Do you remember him, my lady?

270
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,670
Qing Yan?

271
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,310
This name sounds familiar.

272
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,430
What's wrong?

273
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,150
Is he linked to the Cloud Brothel fires?

274
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,790
While investigating, we found

275
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,220
that the time Qing Yan left the East Mansion

276
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,990
and the time Luna appeared

277
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,740
was about the same.

278
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,990
So we suspect

279
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,990
Qing Yan and Luna

280
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,589
may be the same person.

281
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,910
Before Qing Yan left here,

282
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,430
I heard that

283
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,150
you caught him of wrongly keeping the book.

284
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,310
Now that you mention it,

285
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,230
I do remember.

286
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,590
I remember

287
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,220
I reprimanded him a bit,

288
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,580
but I never saw him again after.

289
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,750
After all,

290
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,390
he worked in Makeup Service for the First Lady.

291
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,430
So he left the East Mansion.

292
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,790
But

293
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,230
how could the top courtesan

294
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,110
and the servant

295
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,030
be the same person?

296
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,670
I encountered him before.

297
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,750
He's a master of disguise.

298
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,550
Do you recall

299
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,670
any strange behaviors

300
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,470
or suspicious conversations

301
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,150
before he left the mansion?

302
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,510
I only remember

303
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,830
he's good looking

304
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,420
and clever.

305
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,830
I never thought

306
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,870
he'd have anything to do with

307
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,750
a top courtesan killer.

308
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,230
Other than that,

309
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,070
I can't think of anything else.

310
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,590
Sorry, Prince Yi,

311
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,630
I can't help much.

312
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,030
Don't say that, my lady.

313
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,510
Thank you for your time.

314
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,310
Look at this.

315
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,950
The craftsmanship

316
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,350
and the rendering!

317
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,030
I'm just a few steps away

318
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,350
from becoming a Head Metron.

319
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,870
Don't you think so, Jack?

320
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,630
Won't I get a reward from the system?

321
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,630
My dear Si Yan,

322
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,470
everyone is too busy to have a break.

323
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,430
Can you please

324
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,990
give your precious rouges to us

325
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,710
so the ladies and misses can choose?

326
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,870
Miss Si, did you lose your mind?

327
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,950
Let's help her.

328
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,550
I mean...

329
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,430
my cake!

330
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,310
Jack...

331
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,470
What do you want?

332
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm looking for Tong...

333
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,110
I mean Peach.

334
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,190
What do you need Peach for?

335
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,310
She's not in Peace Pavilion now,

336
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,430
but I can pass on the message.

337
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,350
She and I are

338
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,430
from the same hometown.

339
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,910
Please let me see her.

340
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,430
No.

341
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,270
Glasses,

342
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,430
come out, please.

343
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,670
Do you have a butler?

344
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,750
My butler disappeared.

345
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,630
What is a butler?

346
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,190
Don't make a scene.

347
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,470
Leave.

348
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,390
My lady?

349
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,270
Jack?

350
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,710
Who is Jack?

351
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,190
He is the first person I met after I came.

352
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,310
You may not believe it,

353
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,740
but he also knows you.

354
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,630
He knows Hu Ying,

355
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,470
the princes,

356
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,790
and the ladies.

357
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,190
He has supported me throughout

358
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,590
my time in the Palace Makeup Service.

359
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,270
Where's he now?

360
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,430
He is gone.

361
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,430
He got angry with me

362
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,150
and left without saying goodbye.

363
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,030
No loyalty!

364
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,150
Not a true friend!

365
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,270
Si Yan,

366
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,670
Stop repenting.

367
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,950
Find him

368
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,790
and explain everything.

369
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,990
Maybe

370
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,070
he's just busy.

371
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,390
Find him?

372
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,390
Where do I go?

373
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,830
I am stuck in this lousy space.

374
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,510
The tasks are even on time-outs.

375
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,190
How do I go on like this?

376
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,070
Wherever Prince Yi is

377
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,350
will never be a lousy place to be.

378
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,510
Speaking of which,

379
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,030
let me ask you a question.

380
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,790
Say that you've gone through all the trouble

381
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,910
to be with someone you love,

382
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,990
but you need to pay a price.

383
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,470
You must hide

384
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,510
in a place where no one can find you.

385
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,670
You can't return to East City, either.

386
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,870
Will you do that?

387
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,790
Of course not.

388
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,630
It's nice to be with someone I love forever,

389
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,230
but

390
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,910
if I can never return to East City,

391
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,710
it means that

392
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,220
I'll never see my parents,

393
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,470
and I won't see you anymore.

394
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,870
To me,

395
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,060
all of you mean a lot.

396
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,550
I can't bear it.

397
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,550
How about you?

398
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,830
What will you do?

399
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,630
I am not sure.

400
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,190
My top priority

401
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,390
should be getting the tasks back.

402
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,870
I am stuck.

403
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,870
Are you referring to the task

404
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,150
Second Lady asked the Makeup Service

405
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,350
to make sleeping incense?

406
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,350
It is not an easy task.

407
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,350
Making incense is cumbersome.

408
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,220
Since the incense is for the King,

409
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,190
it needs to be premium quality.

410
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,670
It sounds like a good opportunity.

411
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,110
The task seems to have

412
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,590
a high degree of difficulty.

413
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,510
If I complete it,

414
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,350
maybe I'll level up.

415
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,830
Lan Miao,

416
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,390
thanks!

417
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,820
I'll get my hands on it.

418
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,230
Your Highness,

419
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,100
who are

420
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,340
the earrings for?

421
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,790
After so many years,

422
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,550
it's the first time I saw you 
fiddle with accessories for girls.

423
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,670
Miss Tong helped me resolve my longtime issue with women.

424
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,180
Dao,

425
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,510
Go and reserve a table

426
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,630
in Meeting Tower for me tomorrow.

427
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,870
I'll thank her in person.

428
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,470
Yes, Sir.

429
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,740
Prince Yi,

430
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,310
greetings!

431
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,950
Si Yan is still working inside.

432
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,030
Shall we go and get her?

433
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,310
He's waiting to pick up Si Yan.

434
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,910
You sounded jealous!

435
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,150
I can see the envy in your eyes.

436
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,790
I'm not jealous

437
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,190
because my idol is Prince Xiu.

438
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,470
Just stay like this for a bit longer.

439
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,750
Why are you here?

440
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,300
I passed by.

441
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,030
Did you come to see me?

442
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,830
I've made up my mind.

443
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,070
I'll confess our relationship to Mother.

444
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,940
You shouldn't feel aggrieved anymore.

445
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,350
Actually,

446
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,830
First Lady didn't give me too much of a hard time.

447
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,830
She is nothing compared to

448
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,150
the typical mothers-in-law out there.

449
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,420
We aren't married yet,

450
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,870
but I like that you called her mother-in-law.

451
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,150
Qi Yi,

452
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,750
I don't dare to think about it.

453
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,790
We've just started dating.

454
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,670
It's all in two episodes.

455
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,390
It's progressing too fast.

456
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,270
It won't do.

457
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,950
How could you give in to marrying Xiu that easily?

458
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,430
It's different.

459
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,590
It is just a game.

460
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,750
No,

461
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,950
I mean it was arranged.

462
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,270
But marrying you here...

463
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,630
I am afraid.

464
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,350
What are you afraid of?

465
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,270
I fear that we are not the same.

466
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,430
I fear that the system wants me to harm you.

467
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,390
I fear that I will regret everything

468
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,670
if I can never leave here.

469
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,630
I fear that you won't get used to the real me.

470
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,950
Can't we enjoy being in love with each other?

471
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,830
Just like now,

472
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,060
we only have each other in our eyes.

473
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,310
There is no First Lady,

474
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,510
no Miss Min,

475
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,710
no identity,

476
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,710
and no need to consider the future,

477
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,910
but to peacefully look at you.

478
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,710
Si Yan,

479
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,190
you showed me not to run away

480
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,510
and face my heart with courage.

481
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,150
I want to marry you

482
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,430
to keep you by my side.

483
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,790
Morning, my lord,

484
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,430
First Lady

485
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,270
and the officials in Garment Service will be here shortly.

486
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,030
They'd like to take your measurements.

487
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,070
Congratulations, Prince Yi.

488
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,870
Hurry

489
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,150
and take Prince Yi's measurements

490
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,430
for his wedding gown.

491
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,350
Miss Min has stayed in our mansion for several days.

492
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,070
Since you two like each other,

493
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,580
I think that

494
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,110
it's better to hold the wedding early.

495
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,590
It'll also

496
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,830
lift some weight off my shoulders.

497
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,630
Mother,

498
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,350
as the battle in Northland is tight,

499
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,430
everyone in the city worries about the North.

500
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,590
Discussing my marriage at this time

501
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,750
may be inappropriate.

502
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,590
Let's discuss it later
 once the situation stabilizes.

503
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,340
My lady,

504
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,550
aren't you forgetting something?

505
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,670
That's right.

506
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,270
I forgot to share another good news with you.

507
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,380
I heard from Xiu and the King

508
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,510
that Xiu's engagement is canceled.

509
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,750
Actually,

510
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,260
I also like

511
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,550
Si Yan very much.

512
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,350
She is clever,

513
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,430
and she's more than capable of

514
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,220
doing the work in the Makeup Service.

515
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,590
Since Prince Xiu isn't the lucky one,

516
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,030
I was thinking...

517
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,390
How about

518
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,270
you take her in as a concubine?

519
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,830
Don't worry.

520
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,950
I'll talk to the Mins.

521
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,990
If their daughter can be your official wife,

522
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,550
she should be

523
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,820
more tolerant.

524
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,350
At that time,

525
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,190
you can marry both girls.

526
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,910
It'll be a good thing.

527
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,990
Prince Yi,

528
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,150
Her Ladyship goes above and beyond
 in your matters.

529
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,030
After that, Miss Si Yan

530
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,070
will be legitimately married to you,

531
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,550
becoming a rightful Lady.

532
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,270
This is the best of both worlds.

533
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,590
You should take it.

534
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,100
Look!

535
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,030
I picked out

536
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,750
the fabric with my heart.

537
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,870
Do you like it?

538
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,350
Mother,

539
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,180
I'm willing to marry,

540
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,190
but...

541
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,190
What are you doing?

542
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,580
Get up and talk.

543
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,510
But I'll only marry Si Yan,

544
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,830
not Miss Min.

545
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,830
You are foolish!

546
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,550
For a low-class maid,

547
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,150
you are throwing your life away.

548
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,230
Should this be in the mind of a man?

549
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,150
You're straying from the paved route

550
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,510
for a girl of little worth.

551
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,230
What's the point of being wholehearted?

552
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,390
Please don't get mad.

553
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,030
Did she teach you to say that?

554
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,510
Si Yan has nothing to do with it.

555
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,190
Enough!

556
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,590
Stop making excuses for her.

557
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,590
You must marry Miss Min

558
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,940
even if you don't want to.

559
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,870
If we offended General Min,

560
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,630
and thus breached the barrier of the North,

561
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,700
East City will be in danger.

562
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,110
If you are concerned that

563
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,510
General Min will no longer serve East City,

564
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,870
I'll go to the battleground and fight in the front line

565
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,190
to serve East City.

566
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,430
Even if I die in battle, so be it!

567
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,710
You are not allowed to say so.

568
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,710
Don't you forget

569
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,270
how your Brother Teng died?

570
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,950
This sword

571
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,910
fought with me in numerous battles.

572
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,790
Da,

573
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,630
you are

574
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,910
the commander-in-chief for East City troops.

575
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,790
This sword

576
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,860
is yours now.

577
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:12,990
I hope that

578
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,710
you gain victory

579
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,430
and return safely.

580
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,510
Yes, Father.

581
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,110
I'll bring you honor.

582
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,390
Father,

583
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,590
I plead to go to war, too.

584
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,470
Father!

585
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,790
Your Majesty,

586
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,110
please reconsider.

587
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,030
I only have one son left.

588
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,310
Teng has passed away.

589
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,470
I can't...

590
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,340
I can't risk jeopardizing Yi,

591
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,150
Your Majesty...

592
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,910
Yi,

593
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,430
listen to your mother.

594
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,060
Stay in East City

595
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,830
and help me take care of affairs.

596
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,670
Father,

597
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,470
I went to war three years ago,

598
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,190
so I am more familiar with the area

599
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,830
in Northland.

600
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,870
Allowing me to assist my big brother

601
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,070
increases the chance of victory.

602
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,670
Three years ago,

603
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,830
Teng died because of me.

604
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,150
I did not forget about it.

605
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,949
I wish to go to the frontline

606
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,510
to avenge Teng.

607
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,750
I beg for your approval.

608
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,830
Yi!

609
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,110
Get up!

610
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,310
Yi!

611
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,110
Yi,

612
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,230
stand up.

613
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:43,980
Fine.

614
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,270
I hereby appoint

615
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,860
Prince Da as commander-in-chief,

616
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,940
and Prince Yi as deputy general.

617
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,830
I command you

618
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,550
to join forces

619
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,590
and return with victories!

620
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,750
My lord...

621
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,550
The kids are grown.

622
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,670
They should share responsibilities.

623
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,630
Furthermore,

624
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,220
If I don't let Yi go

625
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,470
he can't conquer his demons.

626
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,110
Going to war,

627
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,070
you must be careful.

628
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,070
Don't be reckless.

629
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,390
You wanted to kill me.

631
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,190
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

632
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,470
If you kill me,

633
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,990
your plan will be ruined.

634
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,790
After being with me for so long,

635
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,670
you finally grew some brains

636
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,830
and learned to analyze the situation.

637
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,710
However,

638
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,110
you don't think you'll be able to

639
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,870
take my place by killing me, do you?

640
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,870
You can't wrap fire in the paper.

641
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,310
A secret cannot be kept forever.

642
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,910
All I can do

643
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,790
is maintain the lies

644
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,510
for a little while longer.

645
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,230
Nonsense.

646
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,910
It is like a moth to a flame.

647
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,870
No.

648
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,630
I know clearly

649
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,500
if I don't do anything

650
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,590
Prince Yi and I

651
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,150
will never have a chance to be together.

652
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,390
If I were like you,

653
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,990
born to a wealthy and upper-class family,

654
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,700
then no matter my skills, wisdom,

655
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,790
I'd never been below you.

656
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,510
And the only barrier between Prince Yi and me

657
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,460
is social status.

658
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,870
You don't actually think

659
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,990
the reason you can't be with Prince Yi

660
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,630
is only because of social status?

661
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,510
You care a lot about social status.

662
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,700
Isn't it because

663
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,350
you look down on yourself?

664
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,510
How laughable!

665
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,910
The old me had the same desire as you.

666
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,470
To seize the hard-to-catch

667
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,910
nothingness,

668
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,510
I was confused,

669
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,550
and I struggled,

670
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,350
believing I was mistreated by fate unfairly.

671
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,110
If even you look down on yourself,

672
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,430
why wouldn't others look down on you, too?

673
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,470
What do you mean?

674
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,710
You don't know, do you?

675
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,590
Prince Yi

676
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,870
refused to marry you, Miss Min.

677
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,870
He asked to marry only Si Yan,

678
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,710
and he only wanted to marry her.

679
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,310
Because of this,

680
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,430
he reached a deadlock with the First Lady.

681
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,710
He has asked to go to war.

682
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,350
Impossible.

683
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm a lady.

684
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,310
She's a maid.

685
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,110
She's no match!

686
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,270
She's no match!

687
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,270
Is she no match?

688
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,550
And you are?

689
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,830
You never would've thought

690
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,750
what Prince Yi cared about

691
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,910
was not social status or class.

692
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,710
You can just continue to stay here

693
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,590
and be an ailing

694
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,110
shameful

695
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,670
Miss Min.

696
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,870
Get me a bottle of the best wine.

697
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,990
Never mind.

698
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,510
Prepare some nourishing soup

699
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,030
and her favorite four-flavor cake.

700
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,750
Yes, sir.

701
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,590
My lady,

702
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,070
come with us.

703
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,430
I heard Prince Da and Prince Yi

704
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,230
will be traveling far tomorrow.

705
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,590
Too bad East Mansion's rules

706
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,670
prohibit women from seeing them off.

707
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,110
We can only quietly wish them well.

708
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,860
Is Prince Yi going to war?

709
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,830
His Highness requested to lead an elite troop

710
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,150
to fight the frontline battles.

711
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,470
Brave and heroic!

712
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,870
Si Yan,

713
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,310
why doesn't Prince Yi

714
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,750
visit you before he leaves?

715
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,470
I don't know, either.

716
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,190
Did Prince Yi send the flowers to me?

717
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,790
He's been sending flowers quite often lately.

718
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,030
The flowers are

719
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,070
for the King.

720
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,270
My master said

721
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,230
these African daisies from the west

722
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,620
have calming effects.

723
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,660
They can be used to make drugs

724
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,030
and incenses.

725
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,350
Using these on the King

726
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,550
is beneficial.

727
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,270
Where is he?

728
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,110
He's nowhere to be found.

729
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,710
Why is he going to war?

730
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,630
Is it dangerous?

731
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,550
How do you battle in this game?

732
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,710
How could he not discuss such important matters with me?

733
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,310
Miss Si Yan,

734
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,990
Prince Yi wants to come,

735
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,630
but he can't.

736
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,230
You don't know?

737
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,430
He got into a huge argument
 with the First Lady because of you.

738
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,910
The swelling on his face where she hit him

739
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,110
still hasn't disappeared.

740
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,670
The First Lady prohibits him
 from seeing you before battle,

741
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,190
saying tears only bring bad luck.

742
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,030
Prince Yi knows you worry for him,

743
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,790
so

744
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,470
he sent me to deliver his message.

745
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,030
Put on the best makeup

746
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,910
and greet him on his victorious return.

747
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,790
Qi Yi!

748
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,710
Qi Yi,

749
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,550
let me go with you, please!

750
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,670
I'll go, no matter how far.

751
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,550
No.

752
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,030
Hurry back inside.

753
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,510
I'll return safely.

754
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,790
I come from the West Region.

755
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,140
I want to go home.

756
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,030
Don't leave me alone, please!

757
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,790
Somebody!

758
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,110
Hold Si Yan back.

759
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,230
Don't let her leave.
