1
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:45,254
<i>How it all started? That's a big question.</i>

2
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>I think everybody
has like a different start</i>

3
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>to how they got to this one place</i>

4
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,057
<i>where we all kind of got together
to create BLACKPINK.</i>

5
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,142
<i>But me, personally,</i>

6
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,103
<i>I came through just a simple audition</i>

7
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:04,857
<i>and ended up practicing
at YG Entertainment</i>

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>for about four years, I think it was.</i>

9
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,614
<i>I'm the newest member
out of all four of us.</i>

10
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,909
<i>All I remember is practicing a lot,</i>

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
<i>having a very strong drive,</i>

12
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,372
<i>and a big goal ahead of us.</i>

13
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,460
<i>It took a long time, but we made it</i>

14
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,670
<i>and we debuted as BLACKPINK.</i>

15
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,552
<i>YG's new girl group BLACKPINK
set a new record</i>

16
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>by reaching number one</i>

17
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,973
<i>in a network television music program
in just 14 days after their debut.</i>

18
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:38,933
<i>They have 27 videos,</i>

19
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>including the music video
for "DDU-DU DDU-DU,"</i>

20
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,937
<i>with hundreds of millions of views…</i>

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,396

<i>BLACKPINK is finally having
their first concert in Jamsil</i>

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,865
<i>in their second year since their debut…</i>

27
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,618
-Hello, we are BLACKPINK.
-Hello, we are BLACKPINK.

28
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,038
<i>BLACKPINK started off their world tour
with their first concert.</i>

29
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,375
<i>January 31st, 2021, BLACKPINK celebrates

<i>Fans around the world are looking forward</i>

36
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:24,019
<i>to seeing BLACKPINK in person
to celebrate their 5th anniversary.</i>

37
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:49,785
<i>I think those were really hectic moments.
Because it was our first time.</i>

38
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,663
I'm facing the stage right now

39
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,417
<i>and those were the seats for BLINKS.</i>

40
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,840
There was a stage
that stretched out to the front

41
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,801
<i>and we ran underneath the stage.</i>

42
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,889
<i>I think the most nervous moment is
when we walk toward the backstage</i>

43
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,225
<i>with the anticipation of meeting our fans</i>

44
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,354
<i>and performing for them.
I think that’s the most nervous moment.</i>

45
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:49,214
<i>You know, we haven't been able</i>
<i>to perform live for a while now.</i>

46
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,967
<i>And now that I think back at it</i>

47
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,682
performing on stage is
one of the best parts.

48
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,978
<i>I feel alive when I see our fans</i>

49
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,691
<i>singing along to my song and enjoying it.</i>

50
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,653
<i>That feeling of success like,</i>
<i>"Wow I did it."</i>

51
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,032
<i>"They’re dancing together like I am!"</i>

52
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,327
<i>When I feel that,
I think that’s when I feel most alive.</i>

53
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,081
<i>It’s upsetting that we can’t</i>
<i>have the fans watch the performance.</i>

54
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,044
<i>But I think it just makes us more, like,</i>

55
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,173
you know, gives us more space
to look forward to that day,

56
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,968
and when that day comes for us,
we'll actually be in one room together.

57
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,347
That would be a very very special moment.

58
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,309
Wouldn’t there be much to talk about
when we meet? From now on?

59
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,645
So I'm looking forward to it.

66
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:34,319
Performing with the band

67
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,738
-definitely really great.
-What's next?

68
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,659
The energy is actually unreal.

69
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,124
All the instruments in the back,
singing live.

70
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,919
But the production is
so much different too, so…

71
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:58,385

doing for two years," you know.

<i>We're doing our best here

76
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,573

-Emcee Girl.
-Emcee.

00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,033
-Okay.
-Yes.

88
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,952
We got here today for the rehearsal.

89
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,497
It's for tomorrow,
and what is this rehearsal for?

90
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,166
I believe it's a rehearsal for The Show.

<i>I can’t seem to remember them.</i>

109

138
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,907

our world tour in Lisa's hometown.

00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:35,827
<i>from the beginning to the end.
I hope they take care of themselves.</i>

I just love seeing
how four young women are being themselves.

187
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,925
They are like role models to us.

188
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,386
-Yeah, we all want to be like BLACKPINK.
-Yeah.

Hi Melbourne, I’m Rosé.

00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,998
WELCOME HOME ROSIE

BANGKOK

193
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,754
Hello, I’m Lisa.

194
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,758
I’m so happy to be back here in Thailand.

195
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,349
All four of us, we did really really well,

196
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,602
and I'm very proud
of each and every one of us,

197
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,271
cause we went through a lot.

198
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:38,236
Like, I know you guys only see the stuff
that’s on stage but I feel like

199
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,322
we all go through so much
and I am very very proud…

200
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,323
Now I'm going to cry.

201
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,784
Everybody stop crying.

202
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,705
-Everyone's crying.
-Everyone's crying.

203
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,380
I’m a little shy,

204
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:01,509
but I want to tell everyone…

205
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,347
Thank you again so much, BLINKs.
We love you. Thank you so much.

206
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:10,018
We love you guys so much,
and we have so much more coming.

207
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,561
This is just the beginning for us.

208
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,941
We always love you guys. Thank you.

BLACKPINK THE MOVIE

220
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,907
<i>When you’re growing up you just feel like</i>

221
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,036
<i>there are no limits</i>
<i>to your goals and dreams.</i>

222
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,539
<i>I've had a very hard time here and there,</i>

223
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:16,668
<i>because it was quite challenging
as a 16-year-old,</i>

224
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,546
<i>growing up in a whole different culture.</i>

225
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:23,132
<i>It didn’t seem realistic at the time</i>

226
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,052
<i>but I just knew that</i>
<i>I would make it come true.</i>

227
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,099
<i>I actually envy myself as a trainee</i>

228
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,186
<i>because I do believe</i>
<i>that I was very strong-willed,</i>

229
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,730
<i>very stubborn, so sure about my future</i>

230
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:40,441
<i>and so determined to reach my goals</i>

231
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,777
<i>and I knew I would get there</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

232
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:51,536
<i>I always have to think back on
how passionate I was towards music</i>

233
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,787
<i>and how much music</i>

234
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,832
<i>gave me a lot of the part.</i>

235
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,502
<i>And it turned out to become my life now</i>

236
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,671
<i>to the current day too, so…</i>

237
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,506
<i>Yeah, music is a big part.</i>

238
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,971
<i>Preparing for music in itself is
always a personal thing.</i>

239
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:13,349
<i>Being able to explore for the first time</i>

240
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:18,021
<i>what my music will be about,</i>
<i>and what I’m gonna be showing my fans is</i>

241
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,315
<i>a very rewarding experience.</i>

242
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,862
<i>During the preparations for The Show</i>

243
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,908
<i>I think I was also preparing
my solo project</i>

244
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:34,913
<i>I had just finished
the last shoot for "Gone,"</i>

245
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,749
<i>so that was the second music video</i>
<i>I did back-to-back.</i>

246
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,628
<i>To be honest, I think it's the first time
I'm actually saying this out loud</i>

247
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:44,589
<i>that it really was a challenge.
But at the same time</i>

248
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,760
<i>I was very, very grateful</i>
<i>for the opportunities that I was given.</i>

249
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:53,890
<i>It was a lot of fun creating, thinking,
and just making all things come to life,</i>

250
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,808
<i>all of my, our ideas.</i>

251
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,227
<i>I think I tried my best.</i>

252
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,688
<i>I don’t think I would go back</i>
<i>and change anything,</i>

253
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:04,150
<i>because I really did try</i>
<i>to pour my heart and soul into it.</i>

254
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:08,843
JENNIE

255
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,431
<i>I feel like as far as I remember</i>

256
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:16,851
<i>ever since I was a kid,
I’ve always been the shy kid.</i>

257
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:22,189
<i>I didn’t really like
talking in front of a lot of people.</i>

258
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:27,486
<i>I have a strive
on searching for something new inside</i>

259
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:31,240
<i>where I want to develop that
into something of my own,</i>

260
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,995
<i>and create something
that hasn’t been out to the world.</i>

261
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:42,668
<i>But when it comes to performing on stage,</i>

262
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:48,340
<i>I think I put on this entire new self,</i>

263
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,509
<i>where I’m not afraid.</i>

264
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,185
<i>When I’m performing,</i>
<i>I forget about everything.</i>

265
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,520
<i>It’s just all about me,</i>

266
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,274
<i>expressing myself, expressing our music.</i>

267
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:09,612
<i>I guess I do have a switch inside
somewhere where I turn it on and off,</i>

268
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,989
<i>but it’s not something
that I do purposely.</i>

269
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,450
<i>I think it reacts with music.</i>

270
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:20,873
<i>And the very first energy that I meet
whenever I first jump up on the stage.</i>

271
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,564
<i>I wanna say it’s just something
that I was born with,</i>

272
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,400
<i>because I’m proud of it,
and I'm happy doing it.</i>

273
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,486
<i>So yeah.</i>

274
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:51,250
<i>I think our identity is rather fixed.</i>

275
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,627
<i>I like to think that</i>

276
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:57,297
<i>we have a lot of pride
in having both colors, black and pink.</i>

277
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,841
But because of that,

278
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,970
we’re still in the process
of continuously experimenting.

279
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,724
<i>And fortunately, rather than
not being able to predict it,</i>

280
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,978
<i>we continue to go forward
in the direction that we want.</i>

281
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,398
I just enjoy the whole process.

282
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,066
<i>We all grew up in different cultures.</i>

283
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,569
<i>These various cultures overlapped
and a group was born.</i>

284
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,613
But instead of forcing them into one

285
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:25,367
we worked as a group

286
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:27,828
without losing each of our individuality.

287
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:32,583
I think that rather emerged
as the color of the group BLACKPINK.

288
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,838
I think we shine the brightest

289
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,132
when we do what we love to do.

290
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,676
Now that’d be music, right?

291
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,639
When we are fully expressing
what we want to express,

292
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,435
that’s when we shine the brightest.

293
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,897
<i>So I think it’d be great for us to show</i>

294
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,359
a lot of things
that we enjoy doing in the future.

295
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:02,529
<i>As we do this,
we’ve always done everything thinking,</i>

296
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:07,242
<i>"We could show something like this.
This time, we can show this."</i>

297
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:11,872
<i>I think we can
continue to show different sides of us.</i>

298
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:17,878
We plan on continuing to do
what we want and show it.

299
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:26,887
Five years is not too short
and not too long of a time, right?

300
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:31,350
<i>But a lot of different things happened.</i>

301
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:34,937
<i>There were happy times, and sad times.</i>

302
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:42,736
<i>I think those were
the happiest times of my 20s.</i>

303
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:49,034
<i>When we were on the tour,</i>

304
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:53,121
<i>I’d always feel hectic thinking about</i>

305
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,500
<i>which city we have to go next and such.</i>

306
01:03:57,084 --> 01:04:01,338
But after seeing this video,
I could see that we laughed a lot

307
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:06,426
<i>and really enjoyed our time together.</i>

308
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:12,850
When we first debuted,
we faced all kinds of experiences.

309
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,895
<i>Back, then, there was a fear
about whether or not we were doing well,</i>

310
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:20,440
<i>feeling uncertain about some things.</i>

311
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,193
<i>When we had our first concert,</i>

312
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:29,950
what we say on stage is
also a very important part of our concert.

313
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:34,955
I was really nervous, like,
"Let’s not make any mistake."

314
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:39,835
It’s already been a little over two years
since we debuted.

315
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:43,881
And to be able to have a concert

316
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:48,677
at such a big venue in Korea
in Seoul like this…

317
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,015
Even as I’m saying it,
I feel like we’ve improved very much.

318
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:56,435
And it was all possible thanks to BLINKs.
Right, everyone?

319
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,771
We’ve been together since day one.

320
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:04,651
I like to think we’ve grown a little bit
seeing how we’ve become more comfortable

321
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:08,113
with making a speech
and looking after one another

322
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,489
<i>when we're on stage.</i>

323
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,784
<i>I like to believe that</i>

324
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:15,621
we still have that energy
from when we were trainees.

325
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:21,001
I’m so moved,
thank you all so much for coming.

326
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:25,464
<i>Since the four of us are in this together,
we decided to have a talk</i>

327
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:30,427
<i>on trusting each other more
and trying to enjoy everything.</i>

328
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,514
Since then, it became more enjoyable
to take on new challenges,

329
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:38,101
we became more excited,
and began to look forward to things.

330
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:40,395
I think we grew up a little.

331
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:46,735
We are always here for you, BLINKs,
so please stay with us too. Thank you!

332
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:49,237
When the four of us are together,

333
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:54,076
we always laugh and talk
just like we did when we were trainees.

334
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,912
It’s just so fun to work together too.

335
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,164
-I think we’re the same.
-We are the same.

336
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,542
Now we don’t even have to say a word.

337
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,629
We just look
at each other’s eyes and know.

338
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,547
We just know.

339
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,132
Tell us, Lisa.

340
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:13,428
Yes. Thanks to all of your support

341
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,100
and love, I will strive to work harder

342
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,602
as Lisa of BLACKPINK, everyone.

343
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:21,979
I love you, BLINKs.

344
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,932
BLINKs.

345
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:49,063
We just finished the last US show. Yay!

346
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:51,649
Wow, I still can’t hear anything.

347
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,235
Is my voice coming out alright?

348
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,447
I’m so sad it’s already over.

349
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:03,786
I'm sad to see it come to an end.
It feels bittersweet.

350
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,248
Over the past month and a half

351
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:12,670
there were
many new and exciting experiences.

352
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:17,925
Still, I had a lot of time
to relax in different cities.

353
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:21,304
It was great.

354
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,976
<i>We performed a lot,
and it was a meaningful time.</i>

355
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:31,773
<i>I think I enjoyed every moment
more than I thought I would.</i>

356
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:35,026
<i>It was a meaningful tour,
like a surprise gift.</i>

357
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,863
<i>What I felt the most during the tour was…</i>

358
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,619
<i>It really was a time for me</i>

359
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:48,247
<i>to rethink of myself
as a member of BLACKPINK.</i>

360
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:01,886
I honestly don’t think we’ve changed much
just because it’s been five years.

361
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,472
<i>We haven’t changed much,</i>

362
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:07,642
<i>but what's more reassuring is
having fans by our side,</i>

363
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:11,270
<i>who have always supported us
for the last five years.</i>

364
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,315
There will be the sixth
and the seventh anniversary in the future,

365
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:20,029
and it feels like
we’re getting stronger over the years.

366
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:24,826
I really like the feeling of us and BLINKs

367
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,953
becoming a lot closer.

368
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,164
I can’t believe
it's already been five years.

369
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:38,214
I wish this movie gets
a little bit of our BLINKs'

370
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:42,176
frustration out, and

371
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:46,597
it’s a good memory
that we are also gonna have.

372
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,976
And we can look back at it next year
and talk about it, maybe?

373
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,771
It’s a new step for us,
I’m really glad that

374
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,774
we got this opportunity.

375
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:00,194
And I miss you guys.

376
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:31,476
<i>I feel like I cried a lot
over the five years.</i>

377
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:36,314
<i>When I watch the videos
from my fans, I tear up.</i>

378
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:40,318
I was so touched
when I just saw that video.

379
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:44,030
Even now as I’m talking,
I feel like I’m going to cry.

380
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:48,910
Because those were such happy times.

381
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:05,301
<i>Five years ago,
we were five years younger,</i>

382
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,179
and it was probably the same
with our BLINKs.

383
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,264
As we continued to grow,

384
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:14,393
I was very happy
to be able to share that time with BLINKs.

385
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:18,773
<i>I miss them so much
since we haven’t been able to meet lately.</i>

386
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:22,735
<i>But because we missed each other so much,
when we meet again,</i>

387
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,029
<i>I’m so excited at the thought</i>

388
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:29,075
<i>that we’ll be able to greet them
with the biggest joy.</i>

389
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,160
Thank you so much
for always worrying about us,

390
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:35,039
and above all, thank you that
you always show us love and support.

391
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,166
We miss you so much.

392
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,295
<i>BLINKs have always been there by our side</i>

393
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:43,673
no matter which year of our career it is,

394
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:47,635
showing us so much unchanging love.

395
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:52,431
That's what makes us
want to move forward further.

396
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:57,311
I hope you stay with BLACKPINK
all the way,

397
01:20:57,395 --> 01:21:01,065
as if we are lifelong companions.

398
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:04,110
Thank you, and love you always.

399
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:12,493
Whenever we talk about how we feel inside,

400
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,161
I always have nothing to say.

401
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:16,372
I feel very shy about it, but…

402
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,760
What should I say?

403
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:39,312
There are so many things
that I wanted to say, but…

404
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,274
To keep it short…

405
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,323
Thank you so much.

406
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:56,871
Thank you so much for loving me,
as me, as Lisa of BLACKPINK.

407
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,916
When I was a kid I never imagined

408
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,211
I could be loved

409
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:11,510
by people all over the world.

410
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:16,724
Honestly, thank you
for always supporting me.

411
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,393
Yeah, that’s all.

412
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:26,984
I don't know how to describe my feelings
other than saying thank you.

413
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,948
Thank you BLACKPINK

414
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:34,617
for showing us that
we can do everything, what we love,

415
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,160
when we really believe in it.

416
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:37,370
We love you.

417
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:42,249
Keep going hard ladies.
We got you. We ride or die. We love you.

418
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:46,545
I will forever support BLACKPINK,
and thank you for everything.

419
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,130
Me too.

420
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:51,133
-You're a queen.
-We love you.

421
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,678
I love you guys,
and you guys are doing so well.

422
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,346
And I hope to get to see you again.

423
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,502
<i>As we go up on the stage like this,</i>

424
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:31,507
<i>we can see our light sticks shaking
and hear the cheering.</i>

425
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,720
<i>It’s so pretty.</i>

426
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,849
<i>Some people set it so that it beeps.</i>

427
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,976
<i>You can set it like that.</i>

428
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:46,647
<i>Every time I hear it, I get so excited.
It's so encouraging.</i>

429
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,738
-BLACKPINK!
-BLACKPINK!

430
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:57,616
-BLACKPINK!
-BLACKPINK!

431
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,994
-BLACKPINK!
-BLACKPINK!

432
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,289
We’ll cherish this truly precious memory.

433
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:07,251
Thanks to all of you supporting
and loving us wholeheartedly.

434
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:12,298
We’ll keep this memory
and strive to grow further as BLACKPINK.

435
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:13,716
Thank you.

436
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,065
Stay with us, BLINKs.

437
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,693
WE'LL STAY FOREVER

438
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:33,903
<i>Just once more,</i>

439
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,821
<i>we’ll see you once more closely</i>

440
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,115
<i>So pretty, our BLINKs.</i>

441
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:41,827

JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, LISA
YOU GUYS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME

445
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,143
THANK YOU FOR BEING THE LIGHT OF MY YOUTH

446
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:21,096
So may I make it short
and do it with a gesture?

447
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:22,889
-Suer.
-Okay, I’ll go with my gesture.

448
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:25,225
-Since everyone expresses differently.
-Right.

449
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:30,105
BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever.

450
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,900
-Thank you for reacting.
-Hey, wait.

451
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:35,777
-Nice.
-What is this? I think it’s great.

452
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:37,446
Can you just finish like this?

453
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,781
BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever.

454
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,660
Thank you.
Shall we try it together? Shall we?

455
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:45,871
Like this, BLACKPINK, BLINKs. forever.

456
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,748
Okay, five, six, seven, eight.

457

BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever.

458
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,836
Oh, thank you guys!

459
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:55,380
So funny.

460
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:25,197
And, I miss you guys.
