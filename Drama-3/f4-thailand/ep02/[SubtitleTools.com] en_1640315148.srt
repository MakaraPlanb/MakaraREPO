1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,330
What the hell is wrong with this school?

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,890
These shoes... your mom spent her savings to buy you these.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,970
I'll never give up, not to you.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,809
Thyme has been attacked! Thyme has been attacked!

5
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,369
Record this.

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,350
Can we?

7
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,169
Sure we can. Just hit record.

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,090
Students, what are you doing?

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
(Gorya has gone insane.)

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
(How dare she! She should be arrested. This is assault.)

11
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,030
(She deserves what's coming for her that's 10 times worse.)

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,200
(Lower your confidence and have respect for F4, Gorya.)

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,200
(You're done, Gorya.)

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,840
(Serves her right!)

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,370
(Getting expelled is a punishment too small for what she did.)

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
(Poor Thyme. How could she!)

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,710
(How are F4 doing now? They must be very upset.)

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,649
Hello, Kavin.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,949
It's been a long time. Have you missed us?

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,799
Of course. I wish 8 p.m. comes soon so I can see you.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,459
Who do you want to see?

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,799
Both of you.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,209
Greedy.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,869
I want to take care of both of you.

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,869
Or I can bring my friend along.

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm here with Ren.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,799
Ren, say hi to the girls. They want to see us.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,690
Hello, Ren.

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,050
Ren! You do this again. Again.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,409
You're taking this too lightly.

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,410
The clip of Thyme being kicked has been shared widely.

32
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,410
Look.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,349
(Thyme getting kicked.)

34
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:01,890
So?

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,349
The clip only shows Thyme being kicked,

36
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,900
not when he's messing with her.

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,549
In the end, people will attack that stupid girl, Gorya.

38
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,550
Look carefully.

39
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,480
(Gorya is freaking awesome. She did what I wanted to do for so long.)

40
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:28,833
Though not many, people are starting to resist us.

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,970
You know how a resistance movement starts from a small thing like this.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,839
So? Thyme can manage this anyway.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,180
That's what I'm worried about.

44
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:51,464
Look, I haven't been able to contact him.

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,530
I have no idea how Thyme is going to handle this.

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,230
Ren, what do you think?

47
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,240
How do you say "how are you?" in French?

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,150
(I'm going to be late for school today.)

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,730
What? Let go!

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,059
(I'm going to be late for school today.)

51
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,200
(I've got something to take care of.)

52
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:36,241
Please wait here a moment.

53
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:40,122
Excuse me...

54
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,742
Like it?

55
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,161
Hey you,

56
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:09,511
why did you take me here and do this?

57
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,306
Would it hurt you to smile? You're ruining my dress.

58
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,441
It costs me 5 million baht to work on you.

59
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,011
5 million?!?

60
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:20,221
Spa, makeup, hair styling, and the dress – that's 1 million.

61
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:24,121
The diamond bracelet, ring, and necklace are worth 4 million.

62
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,091
5 million in total.

63
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:31,042
Oh, there's this too. So it's 10 million.

64
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:36,521
With the makeover, it wouldn't be right to take the bus to school.

65
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,601
How do you know I take the bus to school?

66
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,601
I know way more than that.

67
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,201
Did you put a tail on me? What do you want?

68
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,841
I want your apology.

69
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,039
Apology?

70
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,841
You must record a clip of you apologizing to me

71
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:13,561
for having the nerve to openly announce your defiance against me.

72
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,561
Tell everyone you made a mistake standing up against F4.

73
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,561
And you'll get all these things.

74
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:31,181
Don't take too long to think. These are nice things

75
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,106
that you may never be able to afford in this lifetime.

76
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:39,652
Take it. If you don't accept it now,

77
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:45,201
I don't know what those kids at the school will do to you.

78
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:56,756
Record the clip and you'll get a happy ending.

79
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,870
I don't get it.

80
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,371
If you want me to apologize,

81
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,607
you don't need to give me all these things.

82
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:19,852
I have compassion.

83
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:24,685
You actually feel guilty deep down.

84
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,251
That's why you give me all this stuff

85
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,511
and try to negotiate.

86
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:29,986
You're not making sense.

87
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:34,749
But instead of apologizing to me, you do this?

88
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,721
You're not fixing the problem the right way.

89
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,271
I'm not fixing the problem the right way?

90
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,401
Are you crazy? I'm just trying to do a quid....

91
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,381
Quid p...

92
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,461
How does the saying in Thai go?

93
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,486
- Quid pro...
- Quo.

94
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,882
Are you stupid or stupid?

95
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:53,341
I'm not that fluent in Thai.

96
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,741
Just record the clip and take these things. Why are you making it hard?

97
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:57,901
I don't want them. You can have them back.

98
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:58,961
No, record the clip.

99
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,254
Take them back.

100
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:03,311
I don't want these things.

101
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:08,391
And remember no matter how much money you spend,

102
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:10,191
you can never buy me.

103
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:16,541
If I had these beautiful things but no integrity,

104
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:21,682
I'd rather take the bus and be proud of myself.

105
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,522
I will never like these things.

106
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:29,680
Remember this and take them back.

107
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,757
What the hell are you saying? You're not making sense.

108
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,551
These are nice things so take them. Why are you making it so hard?

109
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:39,711
Don't lie and say you don't like them.

110
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,447
Record the clip now! Stop!

111
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:43,477
Let go!

112
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,042
Take the key!

113
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,872
Stop!

114
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,932
Stop!

115
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:56,971
Gorya, where are you going? Take these things.

116
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,942
Gorya! Stop right now!

117
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,871
Do not follow me.

118
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,412
Where am I going?

119
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,632
What is this place?

120
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,931
Too big.

121
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,641
What kind of house is this? So complicated.

122
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,421
Where is my bag?

123
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,871
Where are you going?

124
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,821
Let go of me!

125
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:28,481
How much would it cost for you to apologize to me?

126
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,512
15 million? 20 million?

127
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,431
Stop being a lunatic, you jerk.

128
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,552
- What did you just call me?
- Jerk.

129
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,031
- Call me P'Thyme.
- Why would I call you that? You're acting like a jerk.

130
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,576
I wouldn't call you that. Let go!

131
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,171
Master.

132
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:44,808
What are you two doing?

133
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,518
Nothing.

134
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,682
Handle it.

135
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,871
Please follow me this way.

136
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:17,161
Let go of me!

137
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,900
I told you I can walk out of here on my own.

138
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:53,161
Can't they just kick me out politely?

139
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,490
People in this house have bad manners.

140
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:23,760
Did I make a bad choice standing up against these people?

141
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,042
Grass.

142
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,852
Dry grass maybe.

143
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,101
(Rotten grass.)

144
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:15,711
(No integrity but wants a rich husband.)

145
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:20,005
Who wrote all this? I feel bad for the person being bullied.

146
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:23,172
But if she can't take it...

147
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,542
(Just quit school.)

148
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,747
How can you do this?

149
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:47,213
How can I teach with this writing on the board?

150
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,991
Go and take a seat. Go.

151
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:53,951
Time to split.

152
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:56,135
How come the chair is fallen over?

153
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:58,384
Pick it up.

154
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:13,962
(That weed girl from class B created a scene with F4 because she wanted a guy. The end!)

155
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:15,732
Hey.

156
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:19,801
(True. Someone said her father sold his kidney to pay for his daughter's tuition fee because he wanted a rich son-in-law.)

157
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:21,468
(I heard she's rotten. She's been with more than 10 guys.)

158
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,421
(They said she had an abortion because she didn't know who the father was.)

159
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:28,994
- (Guys, is she in this chat group?)
- (So?)

160
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,242
(Why don't we just ask her?)

161
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:41,022
(How many times have you had an abortion?)

162
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,263
May I go to the restroom?

163
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,765
I'm feeling sick. I must have morning sickness.

164
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,981
Jerks! Fake news.

165
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:07,891
So? What if I've been with 10 guys and got pregnant?

166
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:11,874
It's my business. It's a modern age.

167
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:33,209
What kind of person shouting out this stuff from the rooftop?

168
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,396
You're strange.

169
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:42,549
Oh well. Even someone like Thyme got kicked by you.

170
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,490
I was caught in the moment.

171
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:07,270
P'Ren, I haven't thanked you for the other day at the storage room.

172
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,454
Thank you.

173
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,472
Let me ask you something.

174
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:32,133
If you flew from France at 5 a.m.,

175
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:34,292
what time would you arrive in Thailand?

176
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:40,250
You have to work out the time difference.

177
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,501
I don't have my phone with me.

178
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,012
Never mind.

179
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:48,637
Why did you ask?

180
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,593
I just wanted to know.

181
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:20,671
How did Gorya end up hanging out with Ren?

182
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,166
They look pretty close.

183
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:31,901
Thailand time is 6 hours ahead of France.

184
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:34,858
It takes 11 hours to get here.

185
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:39,390
If you leave France at 5 a.m.,

186
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,111
you'll arrive in Thailand at...

187
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:43,434
What are you doing?

188
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:46,660
Just working out the time.

189
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:49,107
Ren asked me a question.

190
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,906
That guy who helped you the other day.

191
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,161
So? Is he not F4?

192
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:56,150
He is but...

193
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,937
I don't think he's like the others.

194
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,349
I don't know...

195
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,591
The way he thinks is different.

196
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:11,011
Be careful but I trust your senses.

197
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:14,091
Maybe... he may end up being the prince

198
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,691
who gives a kiss to a common girl.

199
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,687
- What kiss?
- Who gives a kiss to a common girl.

200
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,701
I'm not you and that Tesla guy.

201
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,671
I heard you've kissed.

202
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:23,751
What are you talking about?

203
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,951
What are you guys are talking about? A kiss?

204
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:29,571
Guys, you can't joke about this stuff.

205
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,781
I mind that.

206
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,344
The first kiss...

207
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,507
is very crucial for you girls.

208
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,721
You mind about kisses, Uncle Ga?

209
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:42,481
Of course. It may sound old-fashioned.

210
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,879
But the first kiss is so important.

211
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,437
Because there can only be one.

212
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:55,561
And the first time you kiss will change your whole world.

213
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,541
It will be so satisfying. It will...

214
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:58,941
Have you had your first kiss?

215
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,622
Not yet.

216
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,741
Wait. How did we get into this topic?

217
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:06,521
How about that red card thing of yours? Has it been sorted?

218
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,116
It's not but...

219
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,018
Gorya,

220
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,222
is that your friend?

221
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,303
You know,

222
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,402
I used to wonder when there's bullying at the school,

223
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:43,332
why no one dares to help the victim.

224
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:49,178
But when it happened to me, that's when I understood.

225
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:53,847
You stepped in and helped me.

226
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,268
But when it's my time I froze.

227
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:07,059
It took guts to kick Thyme like that.

228
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:16,997
A weak person like me can't even support you.

229
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:24,752
You must be mad at me, Gorya.

230
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,804
Are you hungry, Hana?

231
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,493
Drink.

232
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:09,189
Do you remember the other day you said

233
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:12,595
you wanted us to stay quiet until graduation?

234
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,323
I agree.

235
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,439
It's good you didn't help me.

236
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:24,410
Otherwise, you'd be in a lot of trouble.

237
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:30,609
Your caring about me is enough to make me happy.

238
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,723
Thank you.

239
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,012
The red card thing...

240
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,962
It's best for me to fight alone.

241
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:45,104
You can support me quietly.

242
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:47,377
That's more than enough.

243
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:54,582
I'll sign up for anonymous accounts to protect you online, Gorya.

244
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,514
How about 100 accounts?

245
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,087
How about 101 accounts?

246
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:01,141
Yeah!

247
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,726
Kidnapped?

248
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,963
Yes.

249
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:11,218
She can have you arrested.

250
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:14,011
She can file a report but I can make it go away.

251
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,702
Crap, too difficult. I'm done.

252
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:19,912
Are you frustrated with the game or Gorya?

253
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,061
Why would I be frustrated?

254
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:23,900
Someone like me doesn't need to care about that chick.

255
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:26,521
If you didn't, why would you kidnap her?

256
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,291
True.

257
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:32,567
But she's weird. She doesn't like expensive stuff.

258
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,621
And she even yelled at you.

259
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,481
No. I think it's something he said that rubbed her the wrong way.

260
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,029
You think so low of me, MJ.

261
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,035
When I do something, I've got fitness.
You think so low of me, MJ.

262
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:41,141
When I do something, I've got fitness.

263
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,161
Finesse.

264
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:47,621
But you should be careful.

265
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:53,641
If your sister found out you kidnapped someone, you'd be in trouble, right?

266
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,922
I agree with him, Thyme.

267
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:01,362
Seriously, isn't it time to cancel the red card?

268
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:06,196
I insist that you've gone too far this time.

269
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,499
You know that, right?

270
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,134
You know that if you let it keep going like this,

271
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,703
this thing will blow out of proportion.

272
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:21,104
Trust me, it's not too late to turn back now.

273
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,151
Where are you going?

274
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:39,922
To see Ren. You guys are annoying.

275
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,601
Do you know where he is?

276
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:43,332
Just leave me be.

277
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:47,038
Even if he finds Ren, Ren wouldn't give a damn.

278
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:54,565
True. There's only one thing that Ren cares about now.

279
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:14,208
Please hold this for me for a sec. I'll be back.

280
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,393
What are you doing here?

281
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:30,873
You again.

282
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:38,752
10 p.m.

283
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,741
France is 6 hours apart from Thailand.

284
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:47,972
If you leave France at 5 a.m., you'll get here at 10 p.m.

285
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,362
You actually worked that out.

286
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,655
Do you know Mira?

287
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:15,269
I admire her very much.

288
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:20,844
She's one of the reasons I go to this school.

289
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:27,391
She's beautiful. She's talented. She's perfect all around.

290
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,265
I'd like to be like her.

291
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:46,451
Did you just drink milk?

292
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:48,471
Milk?

293
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:51,373
Oh, soy milk.

294
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,547
I just drank it a second ago.

295
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:05,761
Did you think I was about to kiss you?

296
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:07,600
No.

297
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,991
But the first kiss is so important.

298
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,977
Because there can only be one.

299
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:30,883
Don't lie.

300
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:39,801
I should go. My friend is waiting.

301
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,356
See you.

302
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,841
Let's go.

303
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:00,041
Where were you, Gorya? The mosquitoes were eating me alive.

304
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:08,592
She's that girl.

305
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,632
(Hana: Let's sneak out and have lunch together.)
(Gorya: OK.)

306
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:04,952
(The new red card has been given.)

307
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,481
Por!

308
00:28:54,041 --> 00:29:00,101
I want to know what a beautiful girl would look like with no hair.

309
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:15,379
No!

310
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:26,996
Hana, are you OK?

311
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,556
Why are you doing this? Hana has nothing to do with it.

312
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:39,311
Your enemy is me. You take it out on me.

313
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,954
Best friends have each other's back.

314
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,861
Let's give it to them.

315
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,083
Enough!

316
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:22,780
I will let your friend go if you shave your own hair.

317
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:24,772
Thyme!

318
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,961
Or you can give in.

319
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:41,589
Best friend! Best friend! Best friend!

320
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,745
You... are just a spoiled rich brat.

321
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,500
You got your answer wrong yesterday.

322
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,949
It's 9 p.m.

323
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:15,974
Huh?

324
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:21,263
They adjusted the time.

325
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:24,921
France and Thailand are only 5 hours apart this month.

326
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,581
I'm almost late because of you.

327
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,356
I'm sorry.

328
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,502
Everyone, it's over.

329
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:46,398
Let's go.

330
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:12,830
After a big wave came crashing, the sea is now calm

331
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,255
because of Ren.

332
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:23,663
I don't know why he helped me.

333
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:28,907
But without him, the sea may have been more treacherous.

334
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:32,526
I just hope that

335
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:36,017
there will be no second wave.

336
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,036
But I never would've thought,

337
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:54,192
(Don't give up. #TeamGorya)

338
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,947
the wind would change its direction.

339
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:57,991
(I want a friend like her. #TeamGorya.)

340
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,401
We're sorry.

341
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:16,581
Sorry?

342
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:20,561
I misunderstood you earlier.

343
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,302
I thought you wanted to shine.

344
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:26,251
But I could see yesterday that you wanted to help your friend.

345
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:30,924
You know, the whole school thinks you're a hero.

346
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,246
For all the time we bullied you,

347
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,518
we did it because we didn't want any trouble with F4.

348
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:43,608
But you showed us that we could make a change.

349
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,834
Can you please forgive us?

350
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,217
Mmm.

351
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:01,445
So we can be friends now.

352
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:05,470
Now we will rise against F4 together.

353
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,160
Why don't we create anonymous accounts to expose F4?

354
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:18,832
We already have some.

355
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,303
Really?

356
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:23,632
I want to follow them all.

357
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:27,519
It's good that you have them. Show me.

358
00:35:31,284 --> 00:35:35,170
Great minds think alike.

359
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,961
Are you free tomorrow? Want to party with us?

360
00:35:43,962 --> 00:35:44,912
What kind of party?

361
00:35:44,913 --> 00:35:48,665
A party to welcome back Mira. You know her, right?

362
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,129
She's coming back from France tomorrow.

363
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,603
But I've never been to such a party before.

364
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,296
I don't think I have a dress for it.

365
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:57,733
That's fine.

366
00:35:57,734 --> 00:36:00,506
It's a small party. You can wear any regular clothes.

367
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:03,841
Please. Come with us, both of you.

368
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:06,143
Or you can invite anyone to join.

369
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:10,192
Please. May I add you on Line so I can text you the time and place.

370
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:11,487
Please.

371
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:14,367
Go. This is Mira's party.

372
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:16,233
You adore her, don't you?

373
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:18,721
The situation at school has improved.

374
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,315
This is your chance to make new friends.

375
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,841
Hana said she couldn't come.

376
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:29,427
If I go, I'll surely see F4.

377
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:35,028
That's OK. You have your friends and Ren.

378
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,607
What does Ren have to do with anything?

379
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:42,521
If anyone can join, I can accompany you.

380
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:44,802
But you really should go.

381
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:48,491
Fine, I'll go.

382
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:50,857
Yay!

383
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:54,285
How long have you been eavesdropping?

384
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:57,933
Since we learned you'd been invited to the party.

385
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,923
Isn't this a big event?

386
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:02,133
It surely is. That's not even a question.

387
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,514
Oh, my. I need to find you a beautiful dress.

388
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,764
Let me dig through the closet.

389
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:10,628
Come on, I need a minute to go through the closet.

390
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:15,851
Easy, dear.

391
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:16,991
Come on.

392
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:18,573
What's the fuss about?

393
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,256
Stop. I'll find you a dress.

394
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:22,214
Glakao, did you find what I asked you to?

395
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:23,582
Sure thing, Boss.

396
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,517
How to look sweet and expensive with makeup.

397
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,352
It should be a soft peach tone.

398
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,964
This one and this one.

399
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,712
Your body smell is also important.

400
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:36,132
Good smell can make you feel confident in every situation.

401
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,831
Do we have such an item?

402
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,881
Of course we do. Here it is.

403
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,942
Thanks.

404
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:46,802
As for the dress, here it is.

405
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:50,575
Mom, may I take a picture and post it on IG?

406
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:52,921
Don't take a picture.

407
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,261
Our daughter is going to a party, not a traditional musical performance.

408
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:56,661
What are you talking about?

409
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:58,834
You wore this to see a dramatic performance with me.

410
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,322
It's got to be this one. You mix and match.

411
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,654
Here it is. Mix and match.

412
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,586
Beautiful and expensive.

413
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:07,641
These are different patterns.

414
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:09,801
That's how a rich girl dresses.

415
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:11,964
The top can be one pattern, the bottom can be an aminal print.

416
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:16,794
Stop it. You don't have to go so big.

417
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,304
My friends said it's a small party. I can wear my regular clothes.

418
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,346
Don't think you're going to a small event.

419
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,159
This could be your only chance.

420
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:32,646
The rich guy thing again.

421
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,561
Why would you say that, Glakao?

422
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,409
You had it coming.

423
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:41,065
Dear, we don't need to care about rich guys.

424
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:44,312
But I just want to say that every time you go to a party,

425
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:48,842
there's a chance to meet the nice prince of your dreams.

426
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:53,200
Isn't it better to dress nice and look nice?

427
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:53,210
Correct.
Isn't it better to dress nice and look nice?

428
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:54,272
Correct.

429
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,183
Come on, I'll find you a dress.

430
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:59,042
A new dress. Glakao, come here.

431
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,204
Help me pick what a teenager wears.

432
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,083
A teenager may wear anything for a blouse.

433
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:07,001
But the skirt has to be tiger print.

434
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,068
The prince of my dreams?

435
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:18,599
What are you smiling about?

436
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:21,053
What? Nothing...

437
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:24,663
I was laughing at Dad.

438
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:26,751
Which dress would you pick?

439
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:28,961
Show me more dresses.

440
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,432
Sorry.

441
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,263
Let me make it up to you.

442
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:46,847
How about I buy you a dinner tonight?

443
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,041
I can speak Thai.

444
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:51,684
In that case, come out with us tonight.

445
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:53,809
Our treat.

446
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:56,502
Yes, the place is nearby.

447
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:58,875
So what's it going to be?

448
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,494
Are you coming?

449
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:05,486
When is she coming? I've been waiting a long time.

450
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,780
Can we yell at someone?

451
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:11,527
Thyme, you've scared the chicks away.

452
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:13,622
Why are you so frustrated?

453
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,481
Still mad at Ren?

454
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,597
I'm not mad.

455
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:27,707
Look at him. Lonesome.

456
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:35,391
Not as bad as this one. Much more lonesome.

457
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,265
I missed you so bad.

458
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:09,736
I missed you too.

459
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:18,921
It's been a long time. Have you gotten cuter?

460
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:20,763
Don't tease me.

461
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:22,841
Why are you late?

462
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:25,901
The flight was a bit delayed. Don't be mad.

463
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,470
I really missed you.

464
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:31,201
And I missed all you rascals.

465
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:33,188
Give me a hug.

466
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:36,531
I missed you so much. It's been a while.

467
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:39,541
Did you start any trouble while I was gone?

468
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:40,721
Nothing.

469
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,481
Ren's good at stopping it.

470
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:47,471
Don't care about these two.

471
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,411
Let's focus on you.

472
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:51,675
Did you make any guy fall in love over there?

473
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,672
She's so beautiful. That's not even a question.

474
00:41:54,673 --> 00:41:58,524
Stop it. You should be the one telling me if you have a girlfriend.

475
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,549
No.

476
00:41:59,550 --> 00:41:59,552
You do.
No.

477
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:02,061
You do.

478
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,101
I've figured out these two.

479
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:05,838
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

480
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:11,075
You've been keeping to yourself and drawing.

481
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:14,378
Why don't you go out and meet people?

482
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,667
Like you modeling?

483
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:20,813
Sometimes meeting too many people can be a bad thing.

484
00:42:22,444 --> 00:42:23,913
Someone's jealous.

485
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,641
I may meet a lot of people

486
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:29,956
but no one knows me like you do.

487
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:35,432
You haven't answered me.

488
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:37,911
Has someone pursued you?

489
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:41,459
Come here, I've got something to tell you.

490
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:49,212
Get this.

491
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:53,532
I'm not telling you.

492
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:56,900
I missed you.

493
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,301
Wow, so extravagant.

494
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:11,590
Do people actually live in it? I thought this only happens in a TV show.

495
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,521
That's an overstatement.

496
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:17,775
So big. How many people live here?

497
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:19,552
Will we see Mira?

498
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:33,938
Does this feel a bit strange?

499
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:37,204
Here she comes.

500
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:43,370
Gorya, say hi to everyone in your most exquisite dress.

501
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:47,250
I will post the clip. What should be the caption?

502
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:47,253
What should it be?
I will post the clip. What should be the caption?

503
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,301
What should it be?

504
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:50,721
How about this?

505
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:55,521
Said she'd fight F4, but end up following them around.

506
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:58,441
# LiarSpotted.

507
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,397
Did you trick me into wearing something plain?

508
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,771
So you've been playing me all this time.

509
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:10,312
We are friends. Why would I pick on you?

510
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:13,792
(Whoever roots for Gorya, put your hands up. #TeamGorya)

511
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,121
Do you get off doing something like this?

512
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,511
Let's go, Gorya.

513
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:21,528
There's no use fighting with people like them.

514
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,895
Come on.

515
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:47,923
We haven't even finished our convo and you're running toward F4?

516
00:44:47,924 --> 00:44:49,567
Keep your cool.

517
00:44:52,227 --> 00:44:53,659
People can see right through you.

518
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,561
Gorya?

519
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,375
How did it turn out this way?

520
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:37,714
She's holding a plate.

521
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:40,301
Did she think you're a waitress?

522
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,041
How sad.

523
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:43,250
Let me ask you something.

524
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:45,432
Why do you have to be so mean?

525
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:48,481
Here it is. She's playing a victim as usual.

526
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,241
Don't think we're not onto you.

527
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:52,771
When you announced your stance against F4,

528
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:55,971
you created anonymous accounts to get people on your side.

529
00:45:55,972 --> 00:46:00,121
Sorry. We have all of your fake accounts.

530
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:01,671
Don't worry, Gorya.

531
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:05,581
I can spin the narrative and no one will support you anymore.

532
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:07,721
Confirm.

533
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:08,840
What do you want?

534
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,547
I want you to know your place.

535
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:13,522
You and we are in different classes.

536
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:15,402
Don't think I can't see right through you.

537
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,967
You make it look like you fight for something.

538
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:22,881
But in fact you just want Ren's attention.

539
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:25,421
We saw you making a move on Ren.

540
00:46:25,422 --> 00:46:28,461
Seriously, there's no use.

541
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,962
He's got someone who's far more deserving.

542
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:33,901
Look over there.

543
00:46:33,902 --> 00:46:36,042
See for yourself.

544
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,522
Why does it have to be red heels?

545
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,442
People say Ren's going out with Mira.

546
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:46,405
Do you think you can match her?

547
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:57,591
Your world and ours are different.

548
00:46:57,592 --> 00:46:59,431
You can't change that.

549
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:01,851
Know your place, waitress.

550
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,961
Oops, sorry. We didn't mean to.

551
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:21,261
Take this. You've got stain all over.

552
00:47:29,322 --> 00:47:30,821
Thank you.

553
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,787
What's happening?

554
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,862
That was an accident.

555
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:46,745
I haven't seen you in a while. You're even more beautiful.

556
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,352
Thanks.

557
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,751
I appreciate you coming to my party.

558
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:03,121
Let's celebrate together.

559
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:21,882
Let's get out of here.

560
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:26,041
Ren, please help!

561
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,601
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,042
Why did you help me?

563
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:57,444
Are you Gorya?

564
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:01,750
Ren talks to me a lot about you.

565
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:03,942
For all the time we've known each other,

566
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:06,657
Ren has never talked to me about any girl before.

567
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:11,875
He may feel something for you.

568
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:16,594
No. How can he feel anything for me?

569
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:20,886
Isn't he your boyfriend?

570
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:24,756
Me and Ren? Where did you hear that from?

571
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:28,139
It's what people say.

572
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,016
And I'm not right for him.

573
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:40,881
Gorya, I know you may never trust people like us.

574
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,362
But don't you say you're not right for anything

575
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,478
in terms of financial status or heritage.

576
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:53,387
No one should feel they're not right for anyone because of it,

577
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:55,499
especially you.

578
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:04,053
Please let me come upstairs.

579
00:50:04,057 --> 00:50:05,041
You can't.

580
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,611
But my friend is upstairs.

581
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:09,594
If Ms. Mira doesn't allow it, I cannot let you go.

582
00:50:09,595 --> 00:50:10,767
Please understand.

583
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:11,500
Please let me go up just for a second.

584
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:12,852
I can't.

585
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:14,583
But...

586
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:18,406
Excuse me, this is my sister.

587
00:50:18,407 --> 00:50:20,143
Let me handle it.

588
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:21,162
What?

589
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,810
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

590
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,771
- Let's talk outside.
- Let go of me.

591
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,527
I need to see Gorya.

592
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,081
Let go of me.

593
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:34,464
Are you planning to mess up the party, chipmunk?

594
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:36,105
Are you Kavin?

595
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:38,806
My name is Kaning, not chipmunk.

596
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:41,119
I don't want to see Gorya in this kind of place.

597
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,764
Calm down. We're looking after her.

598
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:46,103
Looking after?

599
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:49,538
You mean pretend like nothing happens as you always do.

600
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:55,964
Look, when a problem occurs, you can erase it just like that.

601
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,832
People support you in everything you do.

602
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:03,683
Look at Gorya. Is there anyone standing beside her?

603
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,961
In the end, no one is on her side.

604
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:12,844
You all are alike.

605
00:51:14,622 --> 00:51:17,746
So you don't trust us.

606
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:23,339
Is there anything that we can trust people like F4 on?

607
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:31,380
How about this? You don't need to trust us.

608
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:35,561
At least, have faith in your friend.

609
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:39,852
Your friend is cool, isn't she?

610
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:46,761
I've seen a clip of you fighting Thyme.

611
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:50,551
I think it's so cool.

612
00:51:50,576 --> 00:51:52,089
What are you doing?

613
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:59,352
(So damn awesome.)

614
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:02,299
I've known Thyme for a long time.

615
00:52:02,736 --> 00:52:04,631
I haven't had the guts to do anything like that.

616
00:52:05,352 --> 00:52:06,731
Really?

617
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:10,025
I should say...

618
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:14,320
even though I have the guts, I can't do anything.

619
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:17,375
You know something?

620
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:21,428
A good life can lack freedom

621
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:25,424
like a bird in a beautiful cage.

622
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:34,453
Since I met you, I feel like doing something crazy.

623
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:41,442
You may be able to change what I haven't been able to.

624
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:48,880
So I want to see that face that flashed up when you fought Thyme again.

625
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,220
How about these shoes?

626
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,464
Please no. Shoes this expensive are not right for me.

627
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:06,214
I told you, there's no such thing as "not right for".

628
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:13,173
Picking out shoes is very important.

629
00:53:13,176 --> 00:53:18,681
Have you heard a saying that goes "good shoes will take to good places,"?

630
00:53:21,793 --> 00:53:29,315
These shoes will take you to a good place that may be hidden

631
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:31,081
until you find it.

632
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,269
My dad said something like that.

633
00:53:36,332 --> 00:53:38,983
Are you ready to go to a good place?

634
00:54:15,272 --> 00:54:17,074
No need to be shy.

635
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:20,441
Go downstairs.

636
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,381
This looks right for you.

637
00:55:14,586 --> 00:55:16,822
You mean this dress? I think...

638
00:55:16,826 --> 00:55:18,693
I mean your facial expression.

639
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:30,530
Take them back. I will never like these things.

640
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,457
Are you ready to go to a good place?

641
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,104
Ren, what the hell are you doing?

642
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:48,696
I gave this girl a red card.

643
00:55:48,697 --> 00:55:50,511
Why do you keep helping her?

644
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:52,408
What do you want, Ren?

645
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:54,291
Come on, Thyme. Come on.

646
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,927
Gorya is so sweet. Don't you like her?

647
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,393
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

648
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:00,484
Thyme!

649
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:04,195
Take it easy.

650
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:07,933
If you have a problem, clear it with me.

651
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:10,067
Mira has nothing to do with it.

652
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:14,572
Clear it with you, Ren. Sure.

653
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,481
Thyme!

654
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:19,001
Clear it with you.

655
00:56:25,036 --> 00:56:27,503
Enough!

656
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:42,558
Oh my god!

657
00:56:46,884 --> 00:56:48,358
You!

658
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,002
You just kissed me.

659
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:08,825
Is this Thyme's first kiss?

660
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:13,977
Chipmunk, your friend is cooler than I thought.

661
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,084
I think Ren knows that kiss was an accident.

662
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,749
Are you OK?

663
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,319
I know now what Gorya is like.

664
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:44,855
What are you doing here?

665
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:47,213
What is he thinking?

666
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:50,063
Tia!

667
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,900
I think everything is undergoing a big change.

668
00:57:53,592 --> 00:57:56,221
I think things will not be the same.

669
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,799
Ren, I have something important to tell you.
