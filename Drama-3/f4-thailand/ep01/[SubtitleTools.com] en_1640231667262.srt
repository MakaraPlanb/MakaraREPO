1
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,544
Life is funny.

2
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,448
For someone who thinks of himself as grand

3
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,424
like he's got all the stars in the palm of his hand...

4
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:39,184
But when he meets you,

5
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:42,928
his small world

6
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:46,816
becomes larger and more beautiful.

7
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,656
We've learned to feel pain,

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
sorrow,

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,872
and have grown because of it.

10
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:02,496
Most importantly,

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,512
you show me how to love.

12
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:19,544
It's funny.

13
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:25,296
My whole world has changed because of one small girl – you.

14
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,290
Thanks.

15
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:19,778
Hi.	I'm Hana.

16
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,727
I've just moved here today from the US.

17
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,088
What's wrong?

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,400
Nothing. My name is Gorya.

19
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:38,384
Why are you doing your homework alone?

20
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:43,728
I'm on an athletic scholarship here.

21
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,048
I have to pay more attention to class than anyone else.

22
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:52,064
Also, I don't really know how to talk to anyone else here.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Why?

24
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,072
Do you see those 3 girls?

25
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:03,904
They like to talk about expensive bags that they just bought

26
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,888
or which country will they go to this summer?

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,864
For an international school like this one,

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,424
only rich kids go here.

29
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,040
There are not a lot of students on scholarships like me.

30
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm fine if you want to leave and talk to someone else.

31
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,928
I know I'm quite boring.

32
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:40,480
Want a bite? I made this myself.

33
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,808
I want to be your friend, Gorya.

34
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:50,408
Thanks.

35
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,728
And those girls seem kind of mean.

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,088
By the way, do you have any tips for a new student like me?

37
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:07,624
I do.

38
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,320
You don't know anything about this school, do you?

39
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,976
Not really. I only know what the teacher told me.

40
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:22,944
Have you ever been bullied at your old school?

41
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,000
Or have you bullied someone else?

42
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,248
If you want to survive this school,

43
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:34,832
you need to be on your guard first and foremost.

44
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,744
The bullying here is severe.

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,824
Bullying?

46
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:48,800
In this age? At a school like this?

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,336
Because it's a school like this one.

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,520
The better, safer the school seems,

49
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,016
the more special it is.

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,944
At this school, there's a game.

51
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,182
(A new red card has been sent!)
(Let's go.)

52
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,732
(Hurry!)
(You don't want to miss this.)

53
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:29,352
The game is judged by the most influential group in the school.

54
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:38,720
Whoever runs into trouble with them will receive a red card in their locker,

55
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:46,112
which means that anyone can do whatever they want with this person.

56
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,963
(It's party time.)
(I want to beat up someone.)

57
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,975
They know that they can't do anything serious in front of the camera.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,112
(Don't forget the first rule.)

59
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,128
They have to be as subtle as possible.

60
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,552
(Everything must look like an accident.)

61
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,928
Without evidence,

62
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,480
(The second rule: It never happens.)

63
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:18,496
Give it back!

64
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,490
How is this possible?

65
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:30,320
What about the teachers? Can't they do anything?

66
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,312
The teachers? No one dares.

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,016
Not even the director.

68
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,760
In the end, the victim is forced to go to an old stadium.

69
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
(The last stop is at the abandoned building.)

70
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,543
(The best part.)
(I've been ready for a long time.)

71
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,280
It's the only place without CCTV.

72
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,456
Everyone knows no phones or recordings of any kind are allowed.

73
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:35,040
Without evidence, they can do anything

74
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,304
in front of those 4 guys,

75
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:58,736
who are the most influential people in this school.

76
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,730
They are known as

77
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,730
F4.

78
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,816
Phupha Komolpetch of Class 6/1.

79
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:36,608
A top student with a clean record.

80
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,600
Never had any trouble.

81
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,728
You're a teacher's pet.

82
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:47,896
It's a shame that all that will be ruined

83
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:53,440
just because you planned to expose what happened in this school.

84
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,552
Honestly,

85
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,624
do you think I'm an idiot?

86
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
So?

87
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,768
This red card game is wrong.

88
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:10,046
No matter how hard you try to cover it up, you can't escape the truth.

89
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,224
Remember this, Thyme.

90
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,238
This evidence will not be lost.

91
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,584
Oh?

92
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,328
You must have backed it up then.

93
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:31,040
It will never be lost.

94
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,376
So how has it just been wiped out?

95
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:41,152
How can you do that, Thyme?

96
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,488
Phupha, for us,

97
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:51,392
nothing has ever been hard.

98
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,136
Yes, Master.

99
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,056
It's been taken care of.

100
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,152
Yes.

101
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:03,512
That's all.

102
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,104
It's too bad.

103
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,144
But you're finished.

104
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,472
Thyme!

105
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:50,504
You're not done, huh?

106
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,736
I give it three.

107
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:56,064
Two is enough.

108
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:58,160
Time it.

109
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
Why?

110
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,576
What the hell is wrong with you all?

111
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,768
Why would you let F4 force us to play this game?

112
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:40,544
Open your eyes.

113
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,216
If we work together,

114
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,648
we can stop this game.

115
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,416
You think you're someone?

116
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:07,848
Stop!

117
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,184
Can't you see?

118
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,144
Do you think I ordered them to bully you?

119
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:24,552
No.

120
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:28,848
Everyone wants to do this.

121
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,240
What are you saying?

122
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,024
Look at the world these days.

123
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,168
It's stuffing.

124
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,200
Those who stand out are in the eyes of the public.

125
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:51,776
A minor mistake can cost dearly.

126
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,416
That's why they want a release.

127
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,712
They want an outlet.

128
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,512
They want to do what they can't

129
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,496
like those anonymous accounts.

130
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:17,360
We F4 don't do anything.

131
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,512
We just allow...

132
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,432
allow them to have anonymous accounts in real life.

133
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:31,624
Good luck.

134
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,573
Make sure he gets out alive.

135
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,208
To be honest,

136
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,408
I am disappointed by the world.

137
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,848
The world where everyone is drawn by a shiny shell

138
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,400
ignoring a real problem inside.

139
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,416
Is this a good world?

140
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,376
Is this a world that we want to live in?

141
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,735
What the hell is wrong with this school?

142
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,519
It looks good on the outside but is rotting on the inside.

143
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,440
All the problems are swept under the rug.

144
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:36,455
Are these quality students? They are jackasses. Jackasses!

145
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,095
Especially F4. They think they're so cool.

146
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,175
All they're good for is bullying and hurting others.

147
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,525
They only care about optics.

148
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,656
The world has gone crazy.

149
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,232
Argh!

150
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:01,752
That feels better.

151
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,048
(Maytee O Garden)

152
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,215
Gorya,

153
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,776
stop brooding.

154
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,872
That hurts, Kaning

155
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:32,897
She's brooding all right.

156
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:34,888
Is your sugar low?

157
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,072
Want to add more sugar to freshen up?

158
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,360
Tell us what's wrong.

159
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,605
It's the red card again. Uncle Ga.

160
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,768
F4 did it themselves this time.

161
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,489
That poor boy was hurt.

162
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,168
Come here. Have a bite.

163
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,272
Feeling better now?

164
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,640
You know, since you've moved to Kocher,

165
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,425
you look like this every day.

166
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,128
I'm not fine with it.

167
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,584
Get used to it already.

168
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,720
Smile.

169
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
You got crumbs all over your mouth.

170
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,864
I don't think I can get used to this horrible stuff.

172
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:25,488
You can vent your frustration with us.

173
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Seriously, no matter how many times I've heard about the red card,

174
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,472
I can never bring myself to believe it's true.

175
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,904
This F4 that you're talking about...

176
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:36,048
Are they the same F4 that everyone else is talking about?

177
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,616
I look them up and all I see are good things.

178
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:40,640
People love them.

179
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,176
Hundreds of thousands of people follow them.

180
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,567
The first one,

181
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,967
Thyme – Akira Paramaanantra,

182
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:49,392
the handsome heir of the Parama Group,

183
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:52,603
the no.1 real estate company of Thailand.

184
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,360
He's the only son of Roselyn Paramaanantra.

185
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,688
With his cool swag and tons of money,

186
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,680
girls can't help but fall for him.

187
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:04,915
He's good at sports and school. He's perfect.

188
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,672
He must've bought his way to good grades.

189
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:09,195
He spends his days playing, not going to classes.

190
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,112
He may be good at sports. He's cruel.

191
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:21,544
Hello.

193
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:23,447
Yeah.

194
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,616
I want to know how he spends his day,

195
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,087
how drunk with power he must be

196
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,294
to cover up his crap for this long.

197
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,824
OK, next.

198
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,336
They say any girl who likes to party would know him:

199
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:46,115
MJ – Methas Jarustiwa and his cool bad-boy look.

200
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,815
His family is one of the largest owners

201
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
of entertainment venues and event spaces.

202
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,696
You may bump into him at any well-known posh place.

203
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,136
Not just posh places.

204
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:00,336
His family does a lot of shady businesses.

205
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:06,224
He's got men following him around. He's a mafia.

206
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,472
I'm not giving up.

207
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:18,480
This one. Kavin Taemiyaklin Kittiyangkul,

208
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:21,312
the heir of one of the oldest families in the country.

209
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:24,704
His family members are high-level government officials,

210
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:27,678
doing business in Thai goods export.

211
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,688
It seems like he has good taste. He looks expensive.

212
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:33,502
He looks like a royal.

213
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:34,822
Stop right there.

214
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,795
This one is a major playboy.

215
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,872
Girls at the school agree he's a player.

216
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
I'll be right there.

217
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,520
Sorry, I got to go.

218
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,904
The last one. Ren – Renrawin Aira,

219
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:05,120
the heir of the no.1 health center in Thailand.

220
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,584
He seems like a handsome, quiet, cold, and mysterious guy.

221
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,536
He looks the most indie of all.

222
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,530
He posts only drawings and scenery. Look.

223
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:26,320
What about this one?

224
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
He's...

225
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,920
He seems a bit different from the other F4.

226
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,785
What is this?

227
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,192
We've found the unicorn.

228
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,805
Whatever. The fact that they form a group

229
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,016
and they don't stop one another is wrong.

230
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,976
F4 may seem good, wealthy, and perfect.

231
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,336
But they're the source of all bullying at the school.

232
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Isn't it funny?

233
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,072
You only need to have enough money

234
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,680
to donate to the school to rule it.

235
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,440
It's true.

236
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,376
A bad guy, even if he's handsome...

237
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,792
isn't worth my time.

238
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:30,565
Look, they say F4 comes from Flower Four

239
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,560
as each of them is handsome like 4 different flowers.

240
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,952
There's a fine line between cool and cheesy.

241
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,024
Let's come back to your story, Gorya.

242
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,376
What are you going to do?

243
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:52,888
Hey,

244
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,950
stop thinking of doing anything crazy.

245
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:58,288
I know how you are.

246
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
When either Kaning or the shop runs into trouble,

247
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:03,152
you come and save the day, which is cool.

248
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:06,608
But not this one.

249
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,928
Influence is more dangerous than you think.

250
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,920
An adult like me knows it all too well.

251
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,472
Believe me.

252
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,470
If no one can ever make a difference,

253
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,552
a nobody like us can't either.

254
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:29,608
Trust me on this.

255
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,336
If this can't be fixed,

256
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,496
I can just quit.

257
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:54,085
Today is Gorya's 222nd day in Kocher High School.

258
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,056
I pull out all the stops to celebrate it.

259
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,705
Yay!

260
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,880
Eat as much as you want.

261
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,664
Your dad wanted to treat us all.

262
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,660
Wait, Gorya.

263
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,664
Why are your shoes so worn out?

264
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:11,808
How long have they been in this condition?

265
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,952
Don't your friends tease you when you wear them to school?

266
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:16,725
They are still wearable so I'll keep wearing them.

267
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,728
We should be frugal. We don't come from money.

268
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:22,576
What? We don't come from money?

269
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:27,168
We do have money. That's why I bought roast duck.

270
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:30,257
Don't talk crazy, Dad. How is it possible? Roast duck?

271
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,704
Roast duck rib with rice. All for 19 baht.

272
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,920
Excellent, Dad. You do know how to spend money.

273
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,400
All of you are suffering because of me going to that school.

274
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,976
Who's suffering? We are proud.

275
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:03,552
A small family like ours can send our daughter to a top school.

276
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,656
The lady next door is shocked.

277
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,496
- We are so proud.
- Very much.

278
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:14,223
True. I'm not a good student or a good athlete.

279
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,190
I can't be on a scholarship like you.

280
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:20,016
You're the one thing that I can show off to my friend.

281
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,968
Don't you worry about the expenses.

282
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:30,928
Books, clothes, or miscellaneous costs may be expensive.

283
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:35,536
But your mom and I intend to find money to support it.

284
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,944
Why that face?

285
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:43,088
Problems at school?

286
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
A little bit.

287
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,656
Hang in there.

288
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:54,896
I know your school is nothing like home.

289
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,624
And you worry about the family expenses.

290
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,608
But being at the top school is an entrance to high society

291
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,385
and investing in your future.

292
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:11,376
We all are willing to sacrifice for you to have a better life.

293
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:15,424
Most importantly,

294
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:18,224
attending a top school gives you a chance

295
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:23,775
to meet and fall in love with a handsome rich guy.

296
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:25,961
Such a chance is rare.

297
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,278
So close.

298
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,240
Enough.

299
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,646
I'll stop sulking.

300
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,480
- Let's eat.
- Go.

301
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,753
One, two, three.

302
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:36,924
Yeah!

303
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:38,731
Let's dive in.

304
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,918
There's meat here.

305
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,064
Am I that naive?

306
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,408
I honestly thought going to this school would be nothing but beautiful.

307
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:02,375
You may already know that only a few scholarships are offered at this school,

308
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,168
and that most students who go here are wealthy.

309
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:09,632
But don't worry you won't belong to the school.

310
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,630
Don't hold on to any statuses,

311
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,080
financial or social.

312
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:19,088
I believe that the most important thing is we all have the right to dream.

313
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,352
This is our time.

314
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,584
If you believe in yourself and follow your dream,

315
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,528
a bright future awaits you.

316
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:36,656
Good Luck.

317
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,040
At that time, Mira was a perfect lady in my eyes.

318
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,320
She's the reason I decided to enroll here.

319
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:46,880
In reality,

320
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:48,818
it's not at all like what I imagined.

321
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:01,760
What let me down the most is myself.

322
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:07,968
Before I know it, I've become one of them too.

323
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,080
Are you watching Mira's clip?

324
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,352
She's the coolest, don't you think?

325
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:19,824
You know her too?

326
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,392
How can I not?

327
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:24,592
Mira is my idol.

328
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:28,912
I decided to go to this school because of her.

329
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,208
Same here.

330
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,216
Is anything bothering you?

331
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,488
You look upset.

332
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,744
Are you thinking about yesterday?

333
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:45,128
Yes.

334
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:49,264
I'm feeling bad too.

335
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:53,728
That kind of bullying is awful.

336
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,680
I must thank you for warning me.

337
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,944
Otherwise, I may have helped him and got myself in trouble.

338
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,256
Thank you, friend.

339
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,216
How about this?

340
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,208
Let's focus on schoolwork.

341
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:21,792
Stay quiet and safe until graduation.

342
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:29,360
Stay quiet and safe for a bright future, like what Mira said.

343
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,336
I have to go. See you.

344
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,630
Is this your way of approaching a guy?

345
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:09,704
Thyme,

346
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,838
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

347
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:18,432
I'll have your shoes cleaned or buy you a new pair.

348
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Buy a new pair?

349
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,334
Do you know what these are?

350
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,302
These are tailor-made in Paris.

351
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Can you buy these?

352
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,200
Thyme,

353
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:36,649
go easy on her. She's cute.

354
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,616
Thyme, I want to make it up to you.

355
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,400
I'll do whatever it takes just as long as you forgive me.

356
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,720
Whatever it takes?

357
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:56,856
What would that be?

358
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,128
She can clean your shoes now.

359
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:03,633
Or lick them.

360
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,600
That?

361
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,776
I wouldn't mind though.

362
00:29:18,784 --> 00:29:19,784
Lick it.

363
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
If you do it,

364
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,360
I may forgive you.

365
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Lick it. Lick it. Lick it.

366
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
What are you doing?

367
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:11,323
- Answer me.
- I think it's too much.

368
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,544
What did you just say?

369
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,872
I said, I think it's too much.

370
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,870
You can see my friend didn't mean to.

371
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
Can't you forgive her?

372
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,712
Please spare her.

373
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,448
You dare order me around?

374
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:40,568
I'm not...

375
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:48,960
Sure. Sure.

376
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,384
I forgive your friend,

377
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,056
as per your order.

378
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,776
You misunderstood. I didn't...

379
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:12,480
You're lucky to have such a good friend.

380
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:32,064
Over many months that I've put my head down in this school...

381
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:39,568
Hundreds of days I keep telling myself to stay quiet until graduation.

382
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:43,656
But in the end,

383
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:50,288
I've stepped into the biggest problem of this school.

384
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,472
The problem I hate the most.

385
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,656
But I can't escape it.

386
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,696
(It's started!)

387
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,128
(She's the first girl.)

388
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,808
(How long can she last?)

389
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,120
(She's not going to survive.)

390
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,549
(She's running.)

391
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,184
(Where's she going?)

392
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,704
She can't escape no matter where she goes.

393
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:28,056
True.

394
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,048
I'm having a headache. May I go to the infirmary?

395
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,073
Thank you.

396
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:41,446
(Where is she?)

397
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:42,792
(Someone said she's at the infirmary.)

398
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm feeling sick. I've got a terrible headache.

399
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:05,360
What are you doing?

400
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:10,240
Nothing. We're just a bit sick.

401
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Get some rest then. Stop playing around.

402
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,928
Come on. We're not playing.

403
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:16,408
Nothing like that.

404
00:33:30,464 --> 00:33:32,064
Everything's in the locker.

405
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,664
Here she comes.

406
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,728
What the hell?

407
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:46,128
I don't have problems with you. Why do you listen to those jerks?

408
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,930
Hana,

409
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:58,224
are you OK?

410
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,400
You're not being bullied, are you?

411
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:05,120
Don't worry about me. I can get through this.

412
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:33,055
I didn't mean to.

413
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,216
Poor her.

414
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:36,691
I can smell something.

415
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:40,494
Not sure if it's the musty water or a rotten social pariah.

416
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,320
Must be the latter.

417
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,928
They have all gone crazy.

418
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
You know,

419
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,650
this place used to be quiet

420
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:09,856
until your recent visits.

421
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:18,528
Aren't you going to dry yourself off?

422
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,336
What are you doing? Let me go.

423
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,904
Ren, have you seen a girl who's soaked?

424
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,192
There's only me here.

425
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:47,256
Don't you believe me?

426
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Of course we do.

427
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,536
If you want to find a hiding place until after school,

428
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,640
here is pretty quiet as long as you don't shout.

429
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:48,680
This sucks!

430
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,888
I thought I was going to do something fun at the last stop.

431
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,633
What should we do?

432
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,384
I think we should go home.

433
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
Screw it.

434
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,288
Who is it?

435
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,621
(Where could she go?)

436
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:06,128
(I've been looking all over.)

437
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,153
Thyme.

438
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,590
- Let me go!
- Quiet!

439
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
No!

440
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,288
Are you going to quit?

441
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,793
No!

442
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,410
Fine.

443
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:22,592
I'll make sure you don't dare to show your face here again.

444
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:24,960
Smile, Gorya.

445
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,224
Look beautiful, Gorya.

446
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,344
Say cheese.

447
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,176
Are you having fun?

448
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
That's enough.

449
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,888
But Thyme...

450
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:00,913
I said, that's enough.

451
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:06,248
Leave.

452
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,832
I searched for a new quiet place to take a nap

453
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:36,830
and here you are yet again.

454
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,584
If you're feeling OK, go home.

455
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,848
You want me to leave now?

456
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:21,936
This game is over when I quit school.

457
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,472
Those guys said they'd make me quit today.

458
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,232
I can't escape.

459
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,400
If they're gone,

460
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:51,584
then it's fine, right?

461
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,624
What is this?

462
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:52,320
And you're safe now, right?

463
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,152
Gorya.

464
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:37,648
Maybe we should just let her be.

465
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:41,760
Gorya, when you're ready, come out and talk to me.

466
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,856
Gorya, what's wrong? Why is your door locked?

467
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
(This is infuriating. How could they do this?)

468
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
(You don't want me to call you for real?)

469
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,016
(Sorry. I need to be alone right now.)

470
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:05,840
Can you hear us, dear?

471
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:07,815
Can you hear us?

472
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,296
Gorya, are you all right?

473
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:13,007
Oops.

474
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:18,575
The door is old.

475
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,176
Yes, Dad.

476
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,024
Very old. Very old door. Too bad.

477
00:43:23,055 --> 00:43:25,135
All the men, leave now.

478
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,552
We women will talk.

479
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:28,784
Come on. Go now.

480
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,770
- What, Mom?
- Come on. Go now.

481
00:43:30,795 --> 00:43:32,800
Let me handle this.

482
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Hi, dear.

483
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,008
What's wrong? What's bothering you?

484
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:55,488
Problem at school.

485
00:43:57,616 --> 00:44:00,288
What kind of problem, can you tell me?

486
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,216
I'm tired.

487
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:17,328
I want to go to a regular school.

488
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,472
You don't sound like my daughter.

489
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,440
My daughter is tough.

490
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:36,512
Gorya, you've been strong.

491
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:37,947
You've been tough.

492
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:40,352
Any problems or obstacles, big or small,

493
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:43,152
you've overcome it all.

494
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,984
The future is in your hand.

495
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,112
Fight.

496
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:51,536
Hang in there.

497
00:44:52,384 --> 00:44:53,384
Be strong.

498
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:57,504
And you will get through this one too.

499
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:10,720
Make it your mantra. It's your chance.

500
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,592
Handsome rich guys.

501
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,304
Handsome rich guys.

502
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:19,872
Handsome...

503
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,392
This is really important to you, huh?

504
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:32,975
Gorya, I was joking. Don't take it seriously.

505
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,016
But you take this rich thing seriously.

506
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:43,555
For me, being wealthy can't buy you everything.

507
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,944
It can't buy you everything.

508
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:47,901
But it's better than what we are now, trust me.

509
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:51,304
So...

510
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:54,512
you just want to have a rich kid, huh?

511
00:46:00,064 --> 00:46:02,736
If being rich means ending up like those people,

512
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:05,648
I'd rather be poor.

513
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:31,256
Kavin,

514
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:33,392
don't you want to join me and have some fun?

515
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:37,024
Are you still reading the news about Ren?

516
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,840
Of course. What's gotten to him?

517
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:41,264
It's been shared by lots of people.

518
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,936
He made quite a mess.

519
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:46,112
The whole school must be flooded.

520
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:48,656
How much does he have to pay for the damage?

521
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:51,472
I don't know. Just a few millions, I guess.

522
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:54,648
Kavin,

523
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,936
pay attention to me for a change.

524
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,930
Want a bite?

525
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Are you going to feed me?

526
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,600
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

527
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:25,408
No, please don't. I'm sorry.

528
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,768
Is your brain good for anything other than just sitting there?

529
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,760
If not this, she wouldn't quit.

530
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:38,800
Didn't you tell me to do it?

531
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:41,585
Did I ever teach you to do such a stupid thing?

532
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:42,928
Please don't. You'll kill him.

533
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:44,945
There are other ways. Why didn't you do those?

534
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,608
Take it easy.

535
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,072
Look at them. What they did was pathetic.

536
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:54,784
And what's up with Ren?

537
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:56,632
It's none of his business.

538
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:57,752
Why would he help her?

539
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:01,224
Ren, huh?

540
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:06,608
He messed the school up because of this.

541
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:12,416
Seriously,

542
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,296
you've gone too far, Thyme.

543
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,784
You've never given a red card to any girl.

544
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,440
She's just a little girl.

545
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:26,464
You know that you've gone too far this time, right?

546
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,016
Right, Kavin?

547
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,768
Mr. Thyme,

548
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,072
Madame has arrived back from Singapore.

549
00:48:41,904 --> 00:48:43,792
Please get ready.

550
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,192
When it comes to your enemy,

551
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:54,384
there's no such thing as going too far, pal.

552
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:06,448
You were all quiet, Kavin.

553
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,096
Didn't care to help me there?

554
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:10,320
There's no use talking to him.

555
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,592
Even though I agree with you,

556
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:14,704
have you seen anyone who can stop him?

557
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,376
You know all too well that the Parama family is more special than others.

558
00:49:22,895 --> 00:49:24,637
Last question,

559
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:28,609
it was reported that you've just advertised to one of your long-term supporters.

560
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:31,815
Don't you think it's a little, ruthless?

561
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:35,164
The time has changed.

562
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:38,651
And so business management style has to revolve with it.

563
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:41,843
In the past, my business was run like a family.

564
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:46,116
But now I suppose you can say...

565
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:49,121
it's more like a football match.

566
00:49:50,076 --> 00:49:53,123
If a player causes trouble to the team, well,

567
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,881
it's a shame really.

568
00:49:56,789 --> 00:49:58,644
But somestimes,

569
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:00,891
you have to give them a red card

570
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:15,280
I'll stay here for 3 days this time.

571
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:18,480
Yupin, please make sure everything in the house is in order.

572
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,464
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,928
What are you doing?

574
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,520
Just reading the news.

575
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,120
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

576
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,536
I'll take care of it right away.

577
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,216
Find someone new in time for tomorrow morning.

578
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,000
I heard you had problems at school again.

580
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,488
It's quite frequent lately.

581
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,536
Not a big deal. I can manage.

582
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:23,456
Frequent problems mean there're internal waves.

583
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,680
I don't care what kind of game you create for fun at school.

584
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:39,232
But remember the Paramaanantras have always run a tight ship.

585
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:44,000
If you can't rule a school...

586
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:48,960
you won't be able to control anything when you grow up.

587
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:58,000
Do you know what is the worst thing for people on top?

588
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,056
The higher you are, the colder it gets... that sort of thing?

589
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,464
Sure, but that's not it.

590
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,440
It's the pressure.

591
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,968
When you're on higher ground, the atmospheric pressure is thin.

592
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,672
That's when you really feel the internal pressure.

593
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,670
Do you know what that means?

594
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,880
You think you're so cool driving like that?

595
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,880
You got famous parents or something?

596
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,432
It means the higher you are,

597
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,848
the more uncomfortable you feel inside.

598
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:47,248
It's life.

599
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:52,288
The more prestigious the family you're born into,

600
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,944
the more perfect you have to be.

601
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,616
When you're perfect,

602
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,520
you feel squeezed in.

603
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:04,224
As time passes by,

604
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,928
that person keeps getting more and more distorted.

605
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,670
Isn't that sad?

606
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:15,984
When you're sitting on top,

607
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,080
no one from a lower class can change you.

608
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:25,440
Are you talking about yourself?

609
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:31,744
No. My family doesn't teach me to be that way.

610
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:35,984
My family teaches me to appreciate beautiful things.

611
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:37,980
Geez, very smooth.

612
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:40,896
Let's get on with our drinking.

613
00:53:43,248 --> 00:53:44,248
Cheers.

614
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,905
Give me the tape.

615
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:34,688
Where do you want it?

616
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:37,137
Make sure there's no bubble.

617
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:38,411
Here it is.

618
00:54:38,436 --> 00:54:41,734
Beautiful. Moving on to this bit.

619
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,224
What are you doing?

620
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:46,272
Nothing. We're not doing anything.

621
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:48,608
I was just helping Dad.

622
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,976
Since you're here, have a seat.

623
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,584
What is this? Did you get me a present?

624
00:54:59,872 --> 00:55:02,880
A present, yes. But I didn't get it.

625
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,864
Your mom did.

626
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,856
These shoes...

627
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:27,392
your mom spent her savings to buy you these.

628
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:31,840
She was going to give them to you earlier,

629
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,296
but then things happened.

630
00:55:35,152 --> 00:55:37,408
Try them on.

631
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:40,720
This side. There's a tag.

632
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:42,096
Scissors.

633
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,090
Listen to me, Gorya.

634
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:55,020
She's known all along that you're uncomfortable at the new school.

635
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:02,016
But you know, your mom believes in horoscopes.

636
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:10,288
She said you faced this trouble because you're wearing old shoes.

637
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:16,112
Bad shoes take you to bad places.

638
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,360
The funny thing is your mom complained to me

639
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,968
we could barely afford a pair of nice shoes.

640
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:35,072
How can people like us go to any good places?

641
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,600
In this country at this time,

642
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:45,232
financial status is everything.

643
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,336
But I think we don't need to be wealthy.

644
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:56,352
If we could do a bit better and you're happy,

645
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:58,552
that'd be enough.

646
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:05,104
Hang in there a bit longer.

647
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,224
Your mom and I can only give you this much right now.

648
00:57:12,624 --> 00:57:18,640
But I believe that this thing about the school giving you a hard time...

649
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:27,440
these shoes will take you to a good place that may be hidden

650
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:28,776
until you find it.

651
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,728
Keep calm and walk on?

652
00:57:51,872 --> 00:57:53,136
I'll walk on.

653
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:56,592
Yay!

654
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,140
Oh, there she is.

655
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:06,176
Mom, don't hide anymore. Come here.

656
00:58:06,176 --> 00:58:08,170
How long have you been standing there?

657
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,512
Let me put your name on it so you won't lose it.

658
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,096
What is that? Why didn't you write my name?

659
00:58:20,368 --> 00:58:22,090
Are those falling stars?

660
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,880
Not falling stars. It's grass flowers.

661
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:27,840
You didn't get it. Look again.

662
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:30,176
Here they are.

663
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,384
He's got skills.

664
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:35,369
Let's take a selfie.

665
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,200
Sure thing.

666
00:58:37,311 --> 00:58:38,975
Selfie with the shoes.

667
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,320
Where are the shoes?

668
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:43,289
How do we do this?

669
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:51,392
Although going to this school makes my life more complicated and difficult,

670
00:58:52,048 --> 00:58:55,792
my family's support will sustain me

671
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:01,280
and get me through this school as a regular kid until I graduate.

672
00:59:59,648 --> 01:00:00,864
What are you doing?

673
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,490
(We need to close this job today.)
(Can't let Gorya go so easily. The game isn't over.)

674
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:07,905
Stop!

675
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,728
(She's coming.)
(What a silly girl.)

676
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,360
Give it back.

677
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,784
(Take her to the last stop.)

678
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,190
(Go, go, go.)

679
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,326
(She's sure going to quit today!)

680
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,825
Stop. I'm telling you, stop!

681
01:00:23,984 --> 01:00:25,264
Give it back.

682
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,368
Stop. I'm telling you, stop!

683
01:00:40,576 --> 01:00:41,576
Stop!

684
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:07,432
I'm bored.

685
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,728
What are you playing at?

686
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:14,296
Enough.

687
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:41,952
Isn't this trash?

688
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,520
Why are you playing with it?

689
01:01:45,313 --> 01:01:52,405
Trash needs to be disposed of and placed correctly.

690
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,710
You get it now, right?

691
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,440
Things that are not placed correctly need to be disposed of.

692
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,672
It's an eyesore.

693
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:49,416
Hey.

694
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,160
Are you going to wear that trash...

695
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:17,472
What are you doing?

696
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,728
What you want to see is me giving up, right?

697
01:04:28,128 --> 01:04:29,600
That's enough.

698
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:33,680
From now on,

699
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:36,752
I'll fight whatever you do.

700
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:43,728
I'll never give up, not to you.

701
01:05:10,311 --> 01:05:12,935
Though not many, people are starting to resist us.

702
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,720
We want to apologize to you.

703
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:15,745
Apologize?

704
01:05:16,775 --> 01:05:20,199
There's only one thing Ren cares about these days.

705
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:22,220
I think he's different.

706
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,375
Let's get out of here.

707
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,920
I've seen a clip of you fighting Thyme.

708
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,303
You may be able to change what I haven't been able to.
