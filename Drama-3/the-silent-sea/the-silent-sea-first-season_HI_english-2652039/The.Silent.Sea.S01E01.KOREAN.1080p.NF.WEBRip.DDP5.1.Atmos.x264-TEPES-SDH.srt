-…pretty gloomy here.

174
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>A lunar station</i>
<i>built by the Republic of Korea SAA.</i>

175
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,923
<i>Through independent efforts, the SAA was…</i>

176
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,591
[Captain Han] Why don't you reconsider?

177
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,595
Reconsider?

178
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,013
Going to Balhae Station.

179
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,391
You should reconsider.

180
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,101
[men laughing]

181
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,769
[Heesun] Captain!

182
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,854
Sir Han!

183
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,606
Hey.

184
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,068
[sighs]
This always breaks my heart.

185
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,863
Shouldn't they at least
put their names up there?

186
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,199
[Heesun] Exactly. You'd think
they'd honor the members of the crew.

187
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,326
Long time no see, sir.

188
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,287
Oh. Ryu Taesuk.

189
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,749
Oh, this is Lieutenant!

190
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,543
The famous toughest nails commando?

191
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,754
Oh. I got a good feeling
about this mission.

192
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,714
-Nice to meet you.
-[Heesun] Same.

193
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,467
I'm Gong Soochan. Pound it!

194
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,634
-Oh, right.
-[Soochan laughs]

195
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,511
Nice to meet you. I'm the Top Gun of SAA.

196
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,680
-Kim Sun. It's a pleasure.
-[Taesuk] It's a pleasure.

197
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,141
[laughing]

198
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,309
What?

199
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,936
What kind of guy
nicknames himself Top Gun?

200
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,356
Shut it. He couldn't hack it in the army.
[chuckles]

201
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,610
Well, he got dumped last week
because he's so butt-ugly.

202
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,487
-It wasn't because I'm ugly.
-Why then?

203
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,071
Hi there, I'm Eun Jiyoung.

204
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,365
I was just assigned
to this mission as a co-pilot.

205
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,327
-[Soochan] Oh.
-Good to meet you.

206
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,205
I'm Kim Heesun, the Top Gun of SAA.

207
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,874
Oh, yes. I already know who you are, sir.

208
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,418
How do you know me?
[chuckles]

209
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,130
[Heesun] Oh, man. I'm really
looking forward to this mission.

210
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,466
[beeps]

211
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,264
[Doc Hong] Ooh. The golden card.

212
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,766
Wow.

213
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,812
I've definitely heard about it.
But never seen it before.

214
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,396
[water pouring]

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,648
Yeah.

216
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,483
Are you nervous?

217
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,236
It's scary at first.

218
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,530
But I'm sure
you'll get used to it soon enough.

219
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,449
When you're in space,

220
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
everyday out there
feels like a year on Earth.

221
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,498
So, a little advice,
the way the crew members look

222
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,001
is actually really important.

223
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
Think about it.

224
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:02,716
You're stuck in a tiny spaceship,
staring at the same faces every day.

225
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,552
Without any eye candy,

226
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,596
you just go insane.
[laughs]

227
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,975
I'm the team doctor for this mission,
Hong Gayoung.

228
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,769
Just call me Doc. Doc Hong.

229
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,356
-Nice to meet you, I'm--
-Oh, I know, Dr. Song.

230
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,608
Oh, yeah. You're quite a celebrity.

231
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,734
Can I be honest with you?

232
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,111
No.

233
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,696
[exclaims]

234
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,323
You'd rather keep your distance. Hmm.

235
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,368
So, so, so… Dr. Song or just Jian?

236
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,912
-[scoffs]
-[Doc Hong chuckles]

237
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,581
Ah. Well…

238
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
Dr. Song.

239
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,835
You're a gold member,
let's just go with that.

240
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,545
-[footsteps approaching]
-Ooh.

241
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,715
Here come the higher-ups. Hello.

242
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,719
It has been a while, Dr. Song.

243
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,391
Balhae Station
has to be closed permanently

244
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,352
because of the radiation leak
five years ago.

245
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,689
Your mission is to retrieve
an important sample

246
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:03,068
before we close the station for good,
and you return safely to Earth.

247
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,863
Once you land on the Moon,
you will have only 24 hours

248
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,781
to complete the mission.

249
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,790
The sample we need you to retrieve
is in this capsule right here.

250
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,002
[Mr. Kim] The capsule was designed
to maintain a very low temperature

251
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,588
to protect its contents
from harsh environments.

252
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,342
If the capsule is in good condition,
the retrieval should be no problem at all.

253
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,761
However, if you find
even the smallest defect

254
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,013
either on the outer shell
or its thermoregulator,

255
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,806
you'll have to be extremely careful.

256
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,435
Yes, Dr. Song?

257
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,065
What exactly is the substance inside?

258
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,068
Why does it have to be transported
under such low temperatures?

259
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,237
Well…

260
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,408
That information was lost in the accident,
we do not know for sure.

261
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,785
[Director Choi] Please continue.

262
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,208
[Mr. Kim] Uh, we believe the samples
were left in three separate locations.

263
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,628
We know that the accident
left the station in total disarray,

264
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,004
but we don't have any data

265
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,131
on whether or not
the samples were damaged.

266
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,343
That being said,
we don't need a large amount.

267
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,512
Our main goal

268
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,889
is to safely retrieve at least one sample.

269
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,557
Don't you think this is a little vague?

270
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,769
I mean, you really can't give us
any more details on the samples?

271
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,564
We're not some delivery service
just picking up a package.

272
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,025
It's like any other mission.

273
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
We just have to do as we're told.

274
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,993
The SAA itself was given
very limited information.

275
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,912
We share in frustration
at the lack of details.

276
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,373
If we do not know
what this dangerous substance is,

277
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,001
how are we going to retrieve it safely?

278
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,587
Or is it that the mission
is supposed to fail us all?

279
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,259
[Director Choi]
This is why we need you, Dr. Song.

280
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,719
Dr. Song…

281
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,348
it seems like you think
we're deliberately hiding information

282
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,892
that could be crucial
to the success of the mission.

283
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,023
But like you,
we really don't know anything.

284
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,192
That's why we sought out

285
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,363
a very talented astrobiologist
to help guide our crew.

286
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,865
Or…

287
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,368
did we have the wrong idea?

288
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,914
Captain Han is in charge of the operation,

289
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,043
but when it comes to the sample,

290
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,712
your decisions will take precedence.

291
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,257
So, keep that in mind.

292
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,601
{\an8}5 YEARS AGO

293
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,021
{\an8}You'll never have to worry
about water again.

294
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,607
Rather than a government check,

295
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,318
consider this one
as a gift from your sister.

296
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,402
[scoffs]

297
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,255
GOLD MEMBER, SONG JIAN

298
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,341
[somber music playing]

299
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,786
[Dr. Song] Go on.

300
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,454
[dog whining]

301
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,920
[breathing heavily]

302
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,556
[sobbing]

303
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,650
Captain Han.

304
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,321
Does this happen on all your missions?

305
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,576
It makes no sense
to restrict vital information.

306
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,497
Are you always that passionate?

307
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,959
There's less than a 10% chance
our crew will survive this.

308
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,669
If you're concerned about their safety,

309
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,297
you should reduce the uncertainty
as much as you can.

310
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,758
Uncertainty is everywhere,
in space and on Earth.

311
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,846
So from now on, you just want me
to keep my mouth shut and do as I'm told.

312
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,266
Sounds a little ominous.

313
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,022
Aren't scientists people who find a way

314
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,857
no matter what?

315
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,151
[chuckles]

316
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,739
Are you sure you still want
to join the mission?

317
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,158
You just questioned my work ethic.

318
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,868
I am now.

319
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,161
[chuckles]

320
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,667
I will ask for your opinion
if and when I deem it necessary.

321
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,978
[Doc Hong] Oh, wow.

322
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,855
[indistinct radio chatter]

323
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,440
Why did you bring so much stuff?

324
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,901
Do you have your whole lab in there?
[laughs softly]

325
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,027
Well…

326
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,738
I have no idea what I'm going to need.

327
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,490
[grunts]

328
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,411
[shutter beeps]

329
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,209
Gosh, look at everyone hard at work.

330
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,086
Reporting for duty.

331
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,879
I'm Lee Gisu, the co-pilot.

332
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,841
[Gisu] Nice to meet you.
I look forward to working with you.

333
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,345
[laughs]

334
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,639
[Soochan] I've never seen him before.

335
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,599
Why'd they switch her out?

336
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,020
[Heesun sighs]
I can't believe they treat us like this.

337
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,481
Do you think they ever heard
of teamwork here?

338
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,858
I mean, we're not just
little mechanical parts.

339
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,237
Come on. They can't just switch out
a pilot right before we take off.

340
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,614
We dock in five minutes.
Do you want him gone?

341
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,826
No. I guess I'll make it work.

342
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,666
[grunts]

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,545
You look really nervous, Miss.

344
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,088
Relax.

345
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,844
[Gisu chuckles]

346
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,179
Have something sweet to help you relax.

347
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,309
[Doc Hong] What are you doing?

348
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,102
Go do your job.

349
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,272
Okay? Mr. Nosy,

350
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,816
if you bring us down hard, get ready.

351
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,693
I'm going to throw up
on the back of your head.

352
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,913
[chuckles]

353
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,170
-Have we met before?
-No.

354
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,922
You look familiar.

355
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,093
Uh, I just have one of those faces.
[chuckles]

356
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,386
Nice to meet you.

357
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,182
[chuckles]

358
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,151
Oh, Dr. Song.

359
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,322
I heard EHSRC gave you
a really good water grade.

360
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,948
So, what did they give you? B?

361
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
No way, is it higher? Class A?

362
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,245
[Doc Hong]
What do you care what her grade is?

363
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,790
What difference does it make, anyway?

364
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,751
We all get bumped to Class A
after the mission.

365
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,461
[groans]
Come on.

366
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,129
We might as well be family now.

367
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,465
I was just trying
to get to know her a little.

368
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,133
Don't be so harsh on me, Doc.

369
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,301
[Dr. Song] It's like…

370
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,137
you're all going on a road trip.

371
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,973
Mm. Yeah. We're all just pretending.

372
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,560
What else can we do?
We're already on board.

373
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,111
[Soohyuk] All crew members,
please put on your helmets.

374

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,186
When do we enter the Moon's orbit?

389
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
It's scheduled for 9:06 a.m.

390
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,859
We will be out of touch with Control
for two hours.

391
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,110
There's a meteor shower.

392
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,155
Ask for the revised data when we're back.
Keep your eye on things.

393
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,323
[Taesuk] Yes, sir.

394
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,629
[Mr. Kim]
Mr. Hwang made a substantial contribution

395
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,756
to the construction of Balhae Station.

396
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,094
And stayed there for a long time
as a part of the research team.

397
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,555
He has decided to assist us

398
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,306
as an advisor on the current mission.

399
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:07,023
Anyway, have you guys noticed that
Mr. Hwang is almost a little too quiet?

400
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,151
Has anybody heard him talk? I haven't.

401
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,444
Is that just how he is?

402
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,531
Yeah. I don't know.
But he talks less than you.

403
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,615
[laughs]

404
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,868
I mean, he's the only one here
who has been to Balhae Station.

405
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,288
[Soochan]
I just have a million questions for him.

406
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,373
What really happened there?

407
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,376
I really want to know. Should I ask?
Yeah, I will.

408
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,086
[Heesun] Hey, Soochan.

409
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,379
Don't do it.

410
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,422
Trust me.

411
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,969
I really don't think Mr. Hwang
or Director Choi know more than we do.

412
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,930
[Doc Hong] I can hear you.

413
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,183
Just like everyone else.

414
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,603

-What's going on here?
-The system… One second.

419
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,077
[Soochan] It's the docking system.

420
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,163
The bolt won't last
if we get into the landing orbit.

421
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,748
[Gisu] Oh, shit!

422
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,876
If the bolt falls off,
they'll slam into the engine.

423
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,213
[Taesuk] We can't reach SAA control.

424
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,298
Communication should resume in 20 minutes.

425
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,217
[Soochan] The bolt is shaking like crazy.

426
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,635
-It's going to come off.
-[Gisu] Damn it!

427
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,761
How long until we land?

428
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,681
Uh, we have seven minutes
until landing orbit.

429
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,224
[Soochan] It's going to come off.

430
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,310
Release the module.

431
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,728
-[Gisu] What?
-[Heesun] Sorry?

432
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,064
If we do that,
we'll change the point of entry.

433
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,692
We have to save the landing module
before it's too late.

434
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,693
Release it.

435
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,903
[Captain Han] We have to land
no matter what.

436
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,366

you check your seat belts!

[Heesun] They probably saw the whole thing
back on Earth.

488

[Doc Hong] Mr. Hwang, it's going
to be tough for you to breathe

489
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,158
because your fractured rib
is pushing down on your lung.

490
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,660
Can you move it all?

491
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,829
[Mr. Hwang] Yeah. I'm all right.

Me too.

500
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,415

We're not astronauts without a spaceship.

501

What the hell do we do now?

502
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,295
[Heesun] What do you think?
Hold on until the rescue ship gets here.

503

[Soochan] Captain, do you still think

507
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,583
we could finish the mission
in 24 hours now?

508
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,043
[Heesun] Forget about the mission.

509
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,046
We don't even know
if we can get to the station…

510
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,715
before we run out of oxygen.

511
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,219

if you keep your mouth shut.

512
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,181

we'll contact control and reassess.

Are you all right, Mr. Hwang?

518
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,821
Dr. Song, you can't stop here.
Just keep going.

519
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,707
Dr. Song, we can't stop here.

520
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,052
[Captain Han] Get moving.

521
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,266
[Mr. Hwang breathes heavily]

522
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,894
-Huh?
-Yeah, I can.

523
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,980
[Mr. Hwang grunting]

524
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,543
[all breathing heavily]

525
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,592
[panting]

526
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,243
Is that…

527
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,745
Balhae Station?

528
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,707
It looks a lot bigger than I expected.

529
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,421
We should hurry.

530
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,841
If we stay at this rate,
we could run out of oxygen.

531
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,266
The southern side is on a downhill slope.
It might get us there faster.

532
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,604
[Doc Hong] Captain!

533
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,569
[Gisu] Are you sure Mr. Hwang's
going to make it to the station?

534
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,655
[E2] Hang in there, Mr. Hwang.
We're almost there.

535
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,033
[Mr. Hwang breathing heavily]

536

[groans]

537
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,010
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

538
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,554
Bone fragments have punctured his lungs.

539
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,930
We have to get to the station.

540
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,770
Water…

541
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,313
[breathes heavily]

542
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,106

544
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,029

545
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,530
Water?

546
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,699
[Mr. Hwang breathing heavily]

547
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,372
Water…

548
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,582
He's out of water.

549
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,335
Bring some water.

550
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,345
[Soohyuk] Here you go, sir.

551
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,852
[grunts]

552
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,860
Mr. Hwang!

553
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,570
[monitor beeping]

554
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,954

[panting]

556
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,459
The water…

557
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,253
Don't…

[somber music playing]

560
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,264
[Doc Hong] What do we do now, Captain?

561
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,234
Keep moving.
We'll take him with us on our way back.

562
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,987
Yes, sir.

563
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,752
[Captain Han] Let's go.

564
