Why did the elevator in that

I have no idea. I can't control it.
Don't know what happened.

Even if its molecular structure
is different from what we see on Earth,

213
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,458
it's water.

214
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,377
The bodies showed obvious signs
of drowning.

215
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,546
But I still don't understand
how that much water

216
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,381
could be stored in a single body.

217
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,340
[Doc Hong] I know.

218
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,635
At first, I thought
it could be secondary drowning.

219
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,387
But think about Soochan. No way.

220
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,638
[E1] Secondary drowning?

221
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,807
So there are different types of drowning?

222
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,475
If you get water in your lungs,

223
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,770
it can cause pulmonary edema,
respiratory failure.

224
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
And if enough fluid fills
the pulmonary air sacs

225
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,191
and you don't realize it,
it can be fatal later on.

226
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,445
Does that mean you literally drown
because of the water in your body?

227
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,656
How long does it take

228
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,200
for the symptoms to start showing?

229
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,910
It depends on the case.

230
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,289
[Doc Hong] They could show up
in under an hour, but sometimes,

231
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>people collapse in a day or two.</i>

232
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,045
But the amount of water Soochan threw up…

233
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,341
Yeah, I know. He could've never had
that much water in his lungs alone.

234
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,719
[Doc Hong] How can the amount
of water in his body

235
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,138
expand to his lungs, chest and throat?

236
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,514
It's just impossible.

237
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,765
But the water…

238
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,769
The quantity stopped increasing
after he died.

239
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,190
And so?

240
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,320
It multiplies quickly
while the host is alive,

241
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,073
then it stops increasing
when the host dies.

242
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,785
[eerie music]

243
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,960

245

247
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,398
What happened?

248
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,525
You lost consciousness
due to lack of oxygen.

249
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,779
I think you should head over
to the infirmary.

250
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,822
I'm fine.

Are those all different types
of viruses and germs and stuff?

259
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,836
There just aren't any matches here.

260
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,964
[Dr. Song] He was definitely infected
by something.

261
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,887
If it's not in our data, it must be
some kind of extraterrestrial virus.

262
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,723
Even if you're right, do you really think

263
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,017
that's what killed everyone
five years ago?

264
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,353
[Doc Hong]
Everyone else here is completely fine.

265
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,730
So it can't be airborne.

266
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,442
That means Soochan must have been exposed
to contact with an infected host.

267
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,237
But how did it spread so quickly
five years ago?

268

I saw such clear water.

How's it going?

275
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,488
It looks like comms are still down.

276
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
[E2] It didn't work?

277
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,701

278
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,286
[Soohyuk] The panel was replaced,

279
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,580
and the system was rebooted
without any issues.

280
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,374
Yeah. The system is showing
that everything is fine,

281
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,710
but there's no exchange of signals.

282
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,669
Maybe…

283
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,673
The system's hardware itself
was damaged in the accident.

284
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,425
But you just said the system is fine.

285
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,054
But if there's a problem,
the system may not be able to find it.

286
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,056
At the moment,

287
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,601
we can't send or receive signals.

but I haven't come up
with anything, so far.

292
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
{\an8}Of course. I should've checked that first.

No.

302
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,308
It's clearly coming
from outside of the station.

303
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,270
But I don't think any of us
are out there right now. Right?

304
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,147

Whoever it is, I bet they're with the rat
we found at the station.

If the intruder had
a separate communication device,

I think he used an older model
for security.

Not sure I can crack it,
but I'll give it a shot.

350
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,631
We'll talk soon.

You're the one who approved
the co-pilot change,

357
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,663

<i>Once Internal Affairs hears about this,</i>

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,710
<i>they'll conduct a thorough investigation</i>

360
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,587
<i>into the motivations for the replacement.</i>

361
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,298
<i>Obviously, that'll include me.</i>

362
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,802
[Director Choi]
<i>Do you think there's a possibility</i>

363
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,804
<i>that there are other members</i>
<i>working with him?</i>

364
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,138
We can't rule it out.

00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>What matters is,</i>

367
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,147
<i>that we catch the intruder</i>
<i>who took that sample.</i>

368
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,402
So you think it's more important for us
to catch the intruder

369
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,903
than to retrieve the sample?

370
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,156
You of all people should know
how valuable these samples are.

371
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,411
We can't let anyone else
get a hold of them.

372
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,624
We'll need full access to level-one areas
to search thoroughly.

Oh, right. I'll be there soon.

00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,709
They've been talking for a while.

I don't actually agree
with Dr. Song's theory,

387
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,692
but the circumstances
of the co-pilot's death were questionable.

<i>What do you mean, Captain Han?</i>

389

There are no signs

But I think you already knew that, right?

391

What?

392
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,008
[Captain Han] You seemed shocked
when I mentioned the spy,

393
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,719
but then you acted completely indifferent

394
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,638

it sounds like you're starting
to believe Dr. Song's absurd theory.

If you're hiding information
that could jeopardize

You have to complete this mission.

So, the rescue ship will be delayed?

448
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,975
We need more time
to find the intruder and the sample.

449
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,519
Do we have a plan
to capture the intruder yet, Captain?

450
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,229
We should take them alive.

451

But if you've already
retrieved the sample,

452
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,816
then you can shoot to kill.

453
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,111
Copy that.
We'll go start the search, Captain.

-Okay. Taesuk and Sun, come--
-Captain.

She's doing this

456

because we have no way
to get back right now.

457
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,788
She's just using the rescue ship
as leverage.

458

But this is not how she should ask
to extend the mission.

[Heesun] It's not how things are done.

I'm sure you're well-aware

The Moon wasn't an area of interest.

Nobody found much of anything else,

476
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,187
so most countries
pulled out pretty quickly.

477
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,772
However…

478
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,692
we decided not to give up on the Moon.

479
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,985
We turned out to be right.

<i>as newcomers in the industry.</i>

486

"lunar water."

488
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,863
Balhae Station was where
they first studied lunar water.

489
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,117
Is there really water on the Moon?

490
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,120
That's all Director Choi told me
about that mission.

491
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,789
She said we found water,

492
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,625
and if the research was a success, then…

493
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,294
we could save the human race.

494
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,879
Why did you hide this from us?

495
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,300
Why did you go to such length
to keep it a secret?

496
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,470
Isn't it obvious what could happen
if this gets leaked?

497
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,389
Lee Gisu is dead, but someone else
is bound to come after us.

498
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,685
No. The real reason Director Choi
didn't tell us about the sample

499
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,981
is because that water is what killed
everyone at Balhae Station,

500
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,524
including Soochan.

501
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,069

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,366
What… What do you mean?

503
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,496
Um, we think we know what killed Soochan.

504
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,956
It looks like

505
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,792
he was exposed to lunar water.

506
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,043
[Doc Hong] We don't know when.

507
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,212
And we aren't completely sure,

508
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,340
but it seems to act a lot like a virus.

509
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,718
It continues to multiply
until the host dies.

510
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,719
Really?

511
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,931
The water is able to multiply?

512
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,432
Yes.

513
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,143
It multiplies endlessly.

514
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,356
It must have seemed
like the perfect resource.

515
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,944
If we could control the way it multiplied,
if we could commercialize it,

516
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,572
they probably thought
it could save mankind.

517
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,825
If that's possible,

518
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,952
it should happen.

519
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
My sister,

00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,795

00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,147
Look at the Moon.

527
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,111
Do you see all those dark spots?

528
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,072
It's called "Mare Tranquillitatis."

529
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,490
The Silent Sea.

530
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,662
Long ago, Galileo thought
it was all water.

531
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,582
That's why he decided
to name it the Silent Sea.

532
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,754
But once we got to the Moon,
there was no water.

533
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,340
It's just like here.

534
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,263
I heard all of this used to be
an ocean a long time ago.

535
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,683
[young Dr. Song]
The Earth will end up like the Moon.

536
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
Right?

537
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,021
Don't worry so much.

538
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,901
One day, I'll fill all this up
and make it a sea again.

539
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,153
You will?

540
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,654
Mm.

541
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,990
Wait and see.

542
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,619
[young Wongkyung] <i>One day, it'll happen.</i>

543
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,379
[E1 sighs deeply]

544
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,591
You can see why everyone risks
their lives to come and get it, huh?

545
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,553
If you could pull it off,
you'd make a fortune.

546
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,181
Yeah, but there's still no way
to control it yet.

547
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,600
You're right. You can't control it.

548
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,103
We don't even know
how people get infected.

549
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,564
How about us? Are we going to be okay?

550
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,233
Why not?

551
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,362
[sighs]
Whatever.

552
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,243
I guess I'm just going to hold out
until the rescue ship finally gets here.

553
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,204
If we can learn
how to control the lunar water,

554
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,875
we could live in a world
without any kind of classification cards.

555
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,002
How the hell would that happen?

556
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,547
She doesn't tell us a thing
about the mission,

557
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,382
and then we end up losing Soochan.

558
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,598
[Captain Han] I was told
it's still being researched,

559
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,350
so the substance is very unstable.

560
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,104
And it's vulnerable to external stimulus,
so it has to be kept at a low temperature.

561
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,689
That external stimulus

562
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,942
means coming in contact
with a living organism.

563
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,278
[sighs]

564
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,281
The researchers here died
from lunar water infection.

565
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,577
But the government covered everything up
to pretend like it doesn't exist.

566
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,663
[sighs]

567
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,167
We don't know the symptoms
or how you contract it.

568
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,377
There are just too many things
we don't know.

569
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,922
I'm not angry at you or blaming you.

570
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,133
All I'm asking is for more information.

571
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,261
I was against it.

572
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,601
When I found out you're Dr. Song's sister,

573
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,644
I didn't want you joining the team
for this mission.

574
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,856
I don't understand why you came.

575
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,777
My sister was calling me here.

576
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,365
What do you mean calling you?

577
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
You said…

578
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,370
Director Choi gave you the code
to restricted areas.

579
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,083
The station's data,

580
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,670
is all located
inside the main lab storage.

581
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,842
And in order to get in there,
I need someone with level one access.

582
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,973
I mean, her sister was the chief here.

583
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,517
How could she not know a thing about…

584
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,518
About lunar water?

585
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,231
So you're suspicious about her?

586
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,900
Well, no. That's not what I mean.

587
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,610
I guess…

588
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,071
I just don't really get

589
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,074
why she's on this mission at all,
you know?

590
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,703
[Soohyuk]
She was curious, and it was unfair.

591
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,047
If someone in your family died
and you didn't know why,

592
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,133
if everything you knew seemed meaningless
and nothing changed,

593
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,885
you could be at the end of your rope too.

594
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,513
And Soochan…

595
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,432
I know he'd agree with me.

596
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,233
But I'm not saying
I would ever put that before the mission.

597
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,237
[Soohyuk sighs]

598
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,747
[door opening]

599
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,602
How did you know about this?

600
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,773
I just got lucky.

601
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,028
What do you think
that you're going to find in here?

602
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,197
The answer.

603
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,035
Data storage is off-limits to anyone
without authorization.

604
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,161
I know.

605
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,371
Let me go in by myself.

606
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,873
[scoffs]

607
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,428
Unfortunately, I don't trust you yet.

608
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,274

609
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,235

[ominous music]

614
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,642
This is a huge amount of data.

615
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,894
There should be a browser
somewhere in here.

616
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,031
What is that?

617
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,130
[clanking]

618
