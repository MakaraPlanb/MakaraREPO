00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,023
[Dr. Song] The temperature is unstable,
so I don't know.

Huh?

66
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,038
Did you think giving her the lunar water
would solve everything?

67
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
I didn't.

68
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,459
But I wanted to show her

69
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,712
that I wasn't going to hurt her.

70
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,507
That I'm not trying to take the capsule.

71
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,967
I thought that she would understand.

72
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,014
If you do things like that, then you bring
the whole team down with you.

73
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,475
But you saw her.

74
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,771
You saw how her body reacted
to the lunar water.

75
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,857
We all witnessed it.

76
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,277
Her cheek was cut open,
and then it just closed.

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,696
[Heesun] And her wounds healed instantly.

78
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,282
So how can you explain that, Dr. Song?

79
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,287
Dr. Song, do you have any idea
what kind of being she is?

80
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,499
No, I don't.

81
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,127
But what I do know is…

82
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,547
her body can definitely
handle lunar water.

83
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,591
[Doc Hong] He will be okay.

84
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,051
His cut wasn't too deep.

85
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,387
So, what was that girl?

86
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,639
Did the lunar water change her somehow?

87
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,478
Well, it seemed like
her body totally adapted.

88
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,521
Adapted?

89
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,398
She didn't just adapt to it.

90
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,858
Her physical abilities,

91
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,569
and speed of recovery
showed way more than that.

92
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,281
She may have been born
with antibodies for it,

93
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,533
or it may be a special case
of genetic mutation

94
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,994
caused by different environmental factors.

95
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,036
[Doc Hong sighs]

96
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,666
What we do know
is that she's a danger to us.

97
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,004
We should resume the search and catch her,
even if that means killing her--

98
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,547
No, we can't kill her.

99
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,050
We need to kill her
and do whatever it takes

100
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,760
to put an end to this, so we can go home.

101
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,179
We can't do that.

102
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,601
She may be the only key
to the secret of the lunar water.

103
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,811
[pensive music]

104
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,815
She might just be the thing
we need right now.

105
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,818
[Heesun] This is just…

106

-[door closes]

110
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,250
But there's nothing we can use here,
so I'll have to check another lab.

111
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,543
I'll try to find something.

[Taesuk] Yeah, I'm okay.

00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,111
[Heesun sighs deeply]

183
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,904
[Heesun] So, if this mission succeeds,

184
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,241
we could see a swimming pool again.

185
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,326
[Heesun laughs]

186
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,417

187
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,756
[sighs]

188
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,469
[Captain Han]
<i>We'll bait her and capture her.</i>

189
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,015
Show me the map, please.

190
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,933
INP-07.

191
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,481
INP-07 leads to many places.

192
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,277
[Captain Han] <i>If we lure her</i>
<i>with this lunar water</i>

193
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,821
<i>and block off this intersection here…</i>

194
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,284
The one I've just showed you.

195
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,121
[Captain Han] <i>She'll have to come out</i>
<i>of the vent in the machine room.</i>

196
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,708
Then we'll shut both ends of the hallway.

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,543
[Heesun] <i>Like a dog hunt.</i>

198
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,047
So what we wanna do
is chase her down and trap her.

199
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,381
But the problem is,

200
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,676
a wild dog can be extremely vicious.

201
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,595
[Soohyuk] That is true.

202
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,349
Even if we get lucky enough
and manage to trap her in the hallway,

203
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,769
it's still going to be too dangerous
to subdue her and catch her alive.

204
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,024
So that's why we need Dr. Song.

205
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,151
[suspenseful music]

206
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,071
We need to change the plan.

207

[man] <i>What are you talking about?</i>

208
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,533
I think I found something

209
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,910
vital to the research.

210
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,746
[man] <i>If you've secured the sample,</i>
<i>that's enough.</i>

211
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,082
<i>Eliminate the obstacles</i>
<i>and come to Gate Seven.</i>

212
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,921
If you saw it for yourself,

213
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,173
you'd think differently.

214
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,758

217
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,935
[Dr. Song] Hey, Captain.

218
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,896
We shouldn't use guns.

219
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,525
It's important that we don't provoke her

220
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
until I calm her down.

221
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,697
That's my decision to make.

222
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,160
[water sloshes]

223
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,834

[plastic rustles]

225
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,179
[Captain Han] Within the SAA,

226
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,725
some people were against
moving lunar water to Earth.

227
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,770
If we carry something back
without confirming its safety,

228
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,814
it could pose a danger for everyone.

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,649
But Director Choi and the rest

230
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,569
probably thought it's more important

231
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,697
to not let anyone know
about the existence of lunar water.

232
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,656
[scoffs]

233
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,827
Yet everyone in this station was killed
because of the lunar water?

234
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,830
But we need to take this risk.

235
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,749
[sighs deeply]

236
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,253

I'm pretty sure…

239
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,015
the data got deleted.

240
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,934
My sister did it.

241
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,852
She didn't want anyone to find out.

242
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,021

243
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,732
[Captain Han sighs]

244
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,987
Then why do you think
she left you that message?

245
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,406
You know,

246
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,660
in the end, she probably thought
someone had to do this.

247
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,453
Isn't that why she called you here?

248
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,664
I'm not sure.

249
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
Once I figure out the whole truth,

250
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,550
what kind of decision will I have to make?

251
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,973
I have no idea.

Doc Hong, what's going on?

Oh, no. He wasn't conscious.

by any chance?

367
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,652
This is great.
[Heesun laughs]

368
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
We can all go home now.
[chuckles]

369
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,157
-Yes, okay.
-[Heesun] <i>Finally.</i>

370
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,659
But tell me, are E2
and Lieutenant Ryu with you right now?

371
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,037
No, they're not with me.
That's why I'm heading over there.

372
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,956
No, don't. Don't come back here.

373
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,167
Go to the command center
and find their locations.

374
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,627
I'm going to stay here.

375
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
There's a chance they might come back.

376
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,047
I got it. Okay.

[Soohyuk] Captain.

380

Is everyone all right?

381
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,703
I'll get her ready to be transported.

382
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,880
She needs treatment first.

Are we handing her over to backup?

385
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,272
They will take her to Earth, won't they?

386
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,899
Do you know what will happen to her
when she gets there,

387
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,109
and where she'll go?

388
