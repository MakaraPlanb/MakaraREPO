Let's turn the power on first.

00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,060
Yeah. If we can get to the command center,

49
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,313

-[Soohyuk] Yes, sir?

65
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,591
Take a reading here.
I want to know what happened to this man.

66
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,801
[Soohyuk] Right away, sir.

67
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,762
[Captain Han] E1. Bring the scanner here.

We've had reports of attempted breaking

70
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,063
since they shut the station down.

71
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,566
By the look of his gear,
I'd say he's a mercenary.

72
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,696
I don't think we could identify him.

73
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,075
Does the body look odd
to anyone else here?

74
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,369
It looks to me like he drowned.

75
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,872
Do you think he drowned up here?

76
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,749
But that makes no sense at all.

77
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,376
I didn't say that's what happened.

78
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,881
But you see all that foam.
There, around his mouth and nose.

79
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,757
[Doc Hong] Plus,
his lungs are swollen too.

80
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,303
Those are common signs
when the cause of death is drowning.

81
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,724
We'll do an autopsy.
So we can find out for sure.

82
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,519
I'm jealous.
I mean, I realized that he's dead,

83
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,230
but at least the guy didn't die thirsty.

[Doc Hong] The US? Russia?

94
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,257
[Soochan] Well, maybe he's working for RX.

95
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,760
[E2] Isn't that
a huge transnational corporation?

96

00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,519
For Space Mining
and Planetary Development.

100
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,145
[Heesun] Yeah. RX for short.

101
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,188
[Taesuk] That's right.

102
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
[Heesun] Seems like every country on Earth
has a problem with them.

103
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,693
They're like the resource mafia.

[approaching footsteps]

105
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
This place is huge.

106
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,212
It just keeps going on forever.

107
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,132
What do you think they were doing in here
with all this space?

108
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,759
[Doc Hong] Something they don't want
to tell us about.

109
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,304
This station must cost a fortune.

110
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,432
Hold on a second.

111
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,683
What's wrong?

112
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
[Doc Hong] You good?

113
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,106
-The radiation level.
-[Soochan] Isn't it weird?

114
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,401
That's a normal level of radiation, right?
Same as the other areas.

115
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,903
Then I guess this is not the area
where radiation leaked.

116
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,449
I'd expect it to vary,
but not as low as this.

117
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,783
It's strange.

118
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,453
Unless the government report wasn't true?

119
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
What do you think?

120
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,499
We don't actually know
what kind of radioactive substance

121
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,792
killed the crew here.

122
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,170
Or how that substance leaked
or from where.

123
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,922
They haven't told us anything
about what happened.

124
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,885
Are you suggesting that accident
wasn't caused by a radioactive substance?

125
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,595
That's what the number suggests.

126
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,847
And that body we saw,

127
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,268
I don't think he died in an explosion,
or from overexposure.

128
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,853
[approaching footsteps]

129
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,313
Is there a problem here?

130
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,941
The radiation level,
looks like the reading is normal.

131
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,234
[scoffs]

132
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,569
Faulty detector.

133
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,657
Mine's the same.
I don't think the gear's mistaken.

134
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
How much far to the command center?

135
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,871
The main staircase is just ahead.
We go down one level, and there we are.

136
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,873
Let's go.

137
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,625
Getting there is our priority.

138
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,044
[Dr. Song] Captain Han.

139
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,632
We have to investigate further.

140
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,760
We should examine that body.

141
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,262
We should determine
the exact cause of death.

142
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,932
-Didn't you hear what I said?
-[Dr. Song] I did.

143
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,475
But if the radiation didn't kill him,

144
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,478
that means the cause of death
is uncertain.

145
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,271
You think we should just ignore it?

146
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,400
I decide what is or isn't important.

147
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,115
[sighs]

148
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,426
[Gisu] Great. Another hallway. I love it.

149
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,763
[Soochan] Okay.

150
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,015
Let's see if this works.

151
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,685

152
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,479

153
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,522
[Soochan] Bingo!

154
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,529
Wow. Get a load of that view.
[Gisu chuckles]

155
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,993
-[Soohyuk] Check over there.
-[E2] Yes, sir.

156
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,788
-[Soohyuk] You go this way.
-[E1] Yes, sir.

157
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,802
[E2] All quiet over here.

158
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,721
[E1] Same here.

159
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,309
[sighs]
We're clear, sir.

160
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,394
[suspenseful music]

161
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,817
[Gisu] So there's a fuse box
in here or what?

162
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,110
[Heesun] There must be.

163
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,447
[Soochan] I'll activate
the main power supply.

164
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,076
[Soohyuk] E1, E2, check out the equipment.

165
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,328
-[E1] Yes, sir.
-[E2] Yes, sir.

166
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,211
[Gisu] Now this is something.

167
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,173
No wonder so many people
are dying to get in here.

168
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,008
[Gisu sighs]

174
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,605
[Taesuk] Captain.
The communication system is still down.

175
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,275
The rescue team will see
if the power's on.

176
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,278
[Captain Han] But it'll take some time
for the ship to arrive.

177
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,572
Focus on our mission.

178
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,698
Yes, Captain.

179
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,034
The station's life support system
seems to be working okay.

180
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,120
Radiation's fine too.

181
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,830
[Soochan] Everything looks normal.

182
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,499
Even the area
that's supposed to be contaminated.

183
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,625
[Gisu sighs]

184
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,420
So that thing about a filter breakdown
was a big lie.

185
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,966
Why would they shut this place down
if everything was working fine, huh?

186
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
It's like I told you already.

187
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,345
Director Choi and everyone else
at the SAA don't know anything about this.

188
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,599
As far as you can tell,
the station is safe?

189
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,225
According to the readout, it is.

190
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,813
Doctor, can we take our helmets off?

191
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,774
Uh, I guess in theory, you could do it.

192
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,445
-[Heesun] Hey! Hold on! Wait!
-Wait a second, we don't…

193
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
[laughs]

194
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
[sighs]

195
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,372
Looks like everything's normal after all.

196
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,876
If we're going to do
this mission properly,

197
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,671
then we should investigate the facility
for the cause of the accident.

198
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,898
Our mission is to locate those samples,
not to investigate.

199
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,405
You can take off your helmets now.

200
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,741
You… You sure?

201
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,368
Yes, Captain.

202
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,915
Soochan, make sure
everything's up and running.

203
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,335
Right away, sir. I will activate
the air purification system first.

204
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,755
[Captain Han] Remove your helmet.

205
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,049
[helmets clatter]

206
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,176
[Captain Han mutters]

207
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,057
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, PREPARING

208
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,184
[system whirring]

209
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,312
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, ACTIVATED

210
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,398
[tense music]

211
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,571
PURIFICATION INITIATED

212
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,115
[system whirring]

213
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,051
[clattering]

214
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,016
[indicator beeps]

215
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,148
[machine beeping]

216
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,649
Have you been breathing all right?

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,985
My throat's been sore since we got here.

218
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,695
I'm trying not to breathe at all.

219
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,905
[laughs]
And how's that working?

220
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,615
It would work better if I wasn't talking--

221
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,951
Soochan, stop goofing off
and focus on the mission.

222
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,411
I don't want you screwing up.

223
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,913
-All right, big brother, I get it.
-I'm not covering for you.

224
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,582
Just relax for a second, huh?

225
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,169
I can do my job fine, Officer.

226
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,297
[Soochan] You're acting just like Dad.

227
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,174
[sighs]

228
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,219
[beeping]

229
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,305
[trilling]

230
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,390
You may notice,

231
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,810
level one authorization
is required to enter these red areas.

232
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,855
[Soochan] As you can see, this schematic
doesn't have any information

233
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
on what those facilities are.

234
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,317
Which means that most
of the crew members here

235
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
wouldn't have known
what they were either, right?

236
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,113
Just keeps getting weirder.

237
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,865
That's not the weirdest part.

238
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,161
The areas that they supposedly shut down
due to extreme contamination,

239
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,456
were mostly all these
restricted level-one facilities.

240
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,541
I mean, that's some coincidence.

241
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,668
And where are the samples?

242
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,670
There are three storage areas

243
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,923
which should still contain intact samples.

244
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,842
The closest one to us
is there in Storage Two,

245
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
north of the command center.

246
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,553
STORAGE 2

247
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,100
[pensive music]

248
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,394
[beeps]

249
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,986
Supporting facilities
surround the command center

250
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,197
as well as the main lab nearby.

251
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,284
There are a total of eight gates
in Balhae Station.

252
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,080
To avoid the contamination,
in order to reach the machine room,

253
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,208
it would be safest if we were to head
through the main gate.

254
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,429
[Captain Han] We'll split
into three groups.

255
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,516
Doc Hong, E2, and I
are going to Storage One.

256
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,310
Taesuk, Ssun, Soochan,
and E1, Storage Two.

257
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
Officer Gong, Dr. Song, and Gisu,
Storage Three.

258
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,524
Dr. Song?

259
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,777
Right.

260
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,823
When you locate the sample,
check the thermoregulator first.

261
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,742
Its capsule needs to be kept
at a very low temperature.

262
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,202
If this is the case,

263
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,663
the status screen
on the top will be lit up green.

264
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,332
[Dr. Song] However,
if you see a red light,

265
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,084
you don't want to touch it at all.

266
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,961
Teams should stay in communication.

267
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,255
And if the capsule you find
seems unusual in any way,

268
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,923
let Dr. Song know immediately.

269
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,341
[team members] Yes, sir.

270
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,057
[Heesun] Why did he just clap?

271
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,559
-[Soochan] No idea.
-Hey, Soochan.

272
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,603
Yes, Dr. Song?

273
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:54,151
The crew here on this station,
they all had biometric chips, didn't they?

274
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,527
Yes, they did.

275
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,614
[machine beeps]

276
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
Can we access them from the main system?

277
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,746
That could be a simple way for us

278
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,123
to learn the victims' identities
and locations.

279
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,501
I gave it a try already.

280
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,629
It seems like the accident
disabled all of them.

281
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,255
[Soochan] Why do you ask?

282
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,591
No reason.

283
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,509
[Dr. Song] I'm just curious.

284
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,304
We can't let the family members
know anyway, so what's the use?

285
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,308
Oh. See you later.

286
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,104
[Gisu groans]
Let's find these things and go home, guys.

287
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,566
[suspenseful music]

288
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,247
[suspenseful music continues]

289
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,104
[suspenseful music continues]

290
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,920
[ominous music]

291
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,187
I've been in the Moon and Mars,
none of these places are fit for humans.

292
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,191
I don't mean to speak ill of the dead,
but come on!

293
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,445
Hwang must have been a sick man
to survive so many years out here.

294
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,989
I mean, what is there even to do?

295
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,449
It'd drive you insane.

296
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,701
[Gisu] There's one reason,
and one reason only

297
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,952
anybody ever ends up here.

298
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,288
And that's to get yourself
better water privileges.

299
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,373
Even Captain Han.

300
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,752
Sure, he acts
like this big hero for the SAA,

301
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,713
but the only reason he came back
was to get water.

302
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,716
Hey, you know he just handed in
his resignation, right?

303
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,761
But Ms. Choi got him back
for this emergency.

304
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,597
She suckered him in like everyone else
for a higher water class.

305
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,515
Guess you know him well
the way you're talking.

306
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,476
Yeah. I know him better than anyone.

307
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,520
[Gisu] Star student at the academy,
top of his class.

308
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,314
The guy's a legend.

309
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,901
Sure, he's good at what he does.
He's not an idiot.

310
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,153
But you've seen
what working with him is like.

311
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,864
He's so sensitive.
Never listens to anyone.

312
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,783
Wait, is it this way?

313
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,994
I mean, what family doesn't lose a kid
in this day and age?

314
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,916
[gurgles]

315
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
[exhales deeply]

316
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,548
One out of ten children born after
the Great Drought dies within five years.

317
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,926
At least his daughter
was able to make it out a bit longer

318
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,636
-'cause he's a hero.
-Okay, enough.

319
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,513
I don't need to hear about any of that.

320
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,349
Well, that was kind of rude of you,
wasn't it?

321
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,943
Hey, Lieutenant Ryu,
I heard you used to be a pilot.

322
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:23,902
Yeah.

323
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,321
But then you immediately switched
to engineer, is that right?

324
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,280
That is correct.

325
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,534
I was feeling suffocated at headquarters.

326
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,411
Oh, you were feeling suffocated?

327
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,246
And that's why you're here now, huh?

328
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,498
-Fresh air on the Moon?
-[chuckles]

329
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,708
-That's amazing.
-Right? Who doesn't?

330
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,129
It took Soochan there about three,
four years to become a chief engineer.

331
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
Hey, it's not like it's an impossibility.

332
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,049
I could've done it if I really wanted to.

333
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,509
-[shrieks]
-[Heesun] What?

334
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,136
[Soochan] What is that?

335
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,846
[gasps, sighs]

336
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,930
[Heesun] Oh, shit.

337
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,808
Why the hell would anyone
draw something there?

338
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,892
Let's move on.

339
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,894
[Soochan] Didn't they have
anything better to do?

340
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,729
[Soochan sighs in relief]

341
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,899
It's just a drawing. That's all.

342
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,778
[heavy breathing]
Guys, wait up.

343
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,865
[Heesun] What the…

344
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,158
Why won't it open?

345
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,348
Soochan, we can't open the gate.
I need you to check it out for us.

346
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,685
The system doesn't show an issue.

347
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,520
[Soochan]<i>It could be</i>
<i>a mechanical problem.</i>

348
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,022
[E2] We could try forcing it open.

349
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,982

[Mr. Hwang]<i>It must have been tough…</i>

358
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,038
for you to join this mission.

359
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,666
[cats meowing, slurping]

360
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,923
But remember,
we're doing this for the next generation.

361
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,638
Mr. Hwang, does the name…

362
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,391
Luna, mean anything to you at all?

363
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,187
It's just…

364
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,858
something Ms. Choi mentioned
during my meeting with her.

365
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,405
I find it hard to believe
she'd mention Luna at all.

366
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,244
[sighs]

367
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,247
[suspenseful music]

368
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,342
Luna is Balhae's data storage.

What? Were you scared?
[scoffs]

373
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,619
[Gisu] Is something lurking down there?

[E2 grunting]

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,052
[Doc Hong] Hold on a second.

376
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,054
Captain, I think there's something…

377
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,306
stuck in the door.

378
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,476
I can't tell what it is.

379
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,484

384
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,420
[Soochan]<i>Captain, did you get it open?</i>

385
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,217
<i>Captain?</i>

386
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,260
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

387
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,096
We just found more bodies.

388
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,348
They appear to be
the station crew members.

389
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,016
[breathing heavily]

00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,987

Everything all right, Captain?

394
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,997
[Captain Han]<i>We're fine.</i>
<i>We'll take a scan and keep moving.</i>

00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,919
Wha… Why won't the door open?

[groans]

398
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,256
It's 'cause nothing on this station
can be easy.

399
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,845
Dr. Hong, can you show me
what it looks like over there?

400
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,013
[Doc Hong]<i>Sure, give me a second.</i>

401
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,307
[device whirs]

[eerie music]

403
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,533
[Doc Hong] It looks like
they were trying to escape.

404
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,328
Based on the scene, this area
had an emergency shutdown.

405
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,165
Probably right after the accident.

406
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,459
[Heesun]<i>That doesn't track.</i>

407
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,254
According to the report, everyone onboard
died before the shutdown.

408
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,672
Yeah, you're right.

409
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,799
I wonder what the hell
really happened here.

410
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,221
Report back when you find the sample.

411
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,307
We're heading over to Storage One soon.

412
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,184
[Dr. Song]<i>Dr. Hong</i>

413
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,186
I'm not seeing

414
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,980
any burn scars on these bodies.

415
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,148
[Doc Hong]<i>Right.</i>

416
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,859
They're just like the first body.

417
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,028
They all look like drowning victims.

418
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,906
I have no idea what could've caused this.

419
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,241
[Dr. Song]<i>Captain Han,</i>

420
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,286
if conducting an autopsy now
is impossible,

421
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,996
we should stop by the infirmary

422
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,665
so we can check out
the crews' medical records there.

423
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,502
[Captain Han]<i>We've discussed this</i>
<i>already, Doctor.</i>

424
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,588
Well, the situation has clearly changed.

425
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,965
I'm simply sharing a professional opinion.

426
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,468
What exactly has changed?

427
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,430
We've discovered more bodies.
All of them bearing suspicious features.

428
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,849
[Dr. Song]<i>If we can analyze</i>
<i>a tissue sample in the infirmary,</i>

429
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,143
we might be able to learn something,
or find a lead.

430
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,146
We're not here to satisfy
your personal curiosity.

431
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,948
What do you mean?

432
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,074
You heard me.

433
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,628
[glass clanks]

[classical music playing]

435
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,301
Have some water.

436
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,934
To be quite honest,
I'm a little surprised.

437
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,106
This can't be easy for you
after what happened to your sister.

438
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,533
I know it's late,

439
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,119
but you have my word
we'll get their bodies back.

440
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,331
And then Balhae Station
will be permanently shut down.

441
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,043
[sighs]
In any case…

442
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,216
it's better if during the mission,
the others don't find out that you're a…

443
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,343
bereaved family member.

444
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,178
Surely you understand.

445
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,930
Mm.

446
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,141
Yeah.

447
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,269
If they know,
it would be a burden on them.

448
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,270
Mm.

449
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,234
But if you're still concerned about it…

450
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,530
why would you ask me to join the mission?

00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,286

All the slots are…

That's a ton of red lights.

Someone emptied the place out.

464
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,558
Captain, we're searching the room now,

Let's see if there's any still intact.

468
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,136
[E2] On it, sir.

is normal too.

Damn it.

487
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,430
We should keep looking.

[Soohyuk] Is it a malfunction?

498
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,748
No, it's not. The sensor's working fine.

499
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,337
[Soohyuk] Whatever it is, it's by itself.

500
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,381
I don't think that that's one of us.

501
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,300
[Gisu] Mm-hmm.

502
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,260
That means there someone here
we don't know.

503
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,138
I'll go and investigate myself.

504
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,056
You two wait here until I get back.

What the hell are we really doing up here
in this cursed space station?

Do they really expect us to do our job

508

without knowing
what we're really up against here?

I think you should go.

What do you mean?

513
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,256
You know…

514
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,301
to the main infirmary,
like you talked about.

515
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,386
'Cause I've been thinking about it,

516
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,139
and you're exactly right
about what we need to do.

517
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,891
We need to know what really happened here

518
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,060
before we're all a bunch
of dead bodies too.

519
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,437
There's no other choice.

520
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,357
They don't want us to know anything.

521
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,946
I'll make up something
to tell Officer Gong.

522
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
But you should hurry.

523
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,367
