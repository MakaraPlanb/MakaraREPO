Years ago, I had a dog.

Its name was Umul.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,585
[Mr. Kim] It died in the Drought.

9
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,463

11
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,343
It's not on the door. It's on the floor.

What?

13
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,017
The sign. The one at Balhae Station.

He's currently on standby

taking a look at the storage.

30
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,177
What about the signal?

I'm searching the area,

32
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,098

The cause of his death
is cervical spine fracture.

101
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,998
He died on the spot.

102
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,502
He fractured his skull, right arm, ankles…

103
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,004
He has fractures all over.

104
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,093
Even if he had fallen from the ceiling,

105
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,805
it wouldn't have had
an effect on him like this.

106
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,558
Which means he didn't die from the fall.

107

Do you believe Dr. Song?

the state of his body

110
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,530

[Doc Hong] Okay.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,543
Don't let your guard down at all.

116
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,670
Yeah. I got it, Captain.

00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,542
Why was the co-pilot in the storage alone?

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
Why didn't you report him
to us immediately?

122
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,757
Are you trying to accuse me?

123
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,885
When the radio's back on,
I will have to report back

124
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,512
on why I lost two crew members
in under an hour.

125
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,349
I need to know exactly what happened.

I was just…

129
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,949
I was searching the premises.

130
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,452
Sorry, it's my fault for not reporting--

131
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,870
Don't make an excuse.

132
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,123
I'll know once I check your bodycam.

Forget the plan.

137
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,774
All we're going to do now is move corpses.

138

[sighs]

139
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,571
When I was a kid, I'd always look up
to the moon and make wishes.

140
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,701
-But this is one eerie place for sure.
-[door whirs close]

141
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,537
And what's going on with Dr. Song?

142
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,123
What exactly is she trying
to accomplish, huh?

143
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,710
All she did was make us nervous as hell
over a cause of death and all that,

144
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,461
and then she roamed around on her own.

145
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,381
Who does she think she is
to create so much trouble?

146
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,134
[Taesuk] She wasn't trying
to cause trouble.

147
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,220
She was sharing her opinion
as a scientist.

148
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,304
[Taesuk sighs]

149
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,640
I wasn't talking to you.

150
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,850
[Heesun] Now think about it.

151
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,728
-We should all work together as a whole.
-[Soochan breathing heavily]

152
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,772
She nitpicks everything,
and it's bringing us down.

153
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,732
Yeah, true.

154
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,361
We didn't know there wouldn't be
any intact samples left in storage.

155
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,574
Our captain wouldn't give up
on us, though, right?

156
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,868
[Heesun] We'll end up searching
the entire station.

Did you just see that?

163
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,477
He was dragged in by something.

Wait, look right here. Now.

169
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,872
That's a sample.

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,625
And the capsule is intact.

171
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,421
It looks like it was kept
in some kind of solution.

172
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,549
Wait. Right here.

[Heesun sighs]
Our comms got smashed,

178

and the stations don't work.

179

What now? What do we do?

180
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,672
I don't think there's any problem
with the internal system.

181
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,925
Might be related
to the radio tower outside.

182
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,427
[stutters]
Would they send a rescue ship for us?

183
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,470
Of course, they will.

184
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,766
I'm sure they're trying
to figure it out as we speak.

[laughing, sighs]

187
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,568
Look at him. He's asleep.

188
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,946
[laughing continues]
Soochan!

189
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,906
[Heesun] Hello?

190
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,534
Man, what is with you?

191
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,494
-[Soochan wheezing]
-Hey.

192
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,414
-[Soochan grunts, wheezes]
-[Heesun] Are you okay?

193
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,749
You, you… You good?

194
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,793
What's wrong with your face, Soochan?
Are you sick?

195
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,711
Hey!

202
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,071
What could it be?

203
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,823
It didn't seem human to me, sir.

204
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,661
But it took the sample.

205
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,749
If that creature was aware
of the sample's value,

206
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,418
then it is most likely human.

207
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,301
Then I think it looks like
it's probably an intruder or something.

208
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,428
Like that dead mercenary at the gate.

209
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,847
We'll catch it and find out.

210
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,686
It looks curved at the end.

211

[unsettling music]

212
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,158
The passage continues.
Should we go after it?

213
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,369
It couldn't have gotten too far away.

[Heesun over earpiece]

221
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,737
Doc Hong, where are you?

222
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,407
I'm coming right now!

223
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,908
Do not come into contact with him!

224
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,285
Put on your hazmat suits and wait for me.
Do you hear me?

[Heesun] What's taking her so long?

230

Don't worry. She'll be here soon.

-No. Let me go.

258
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,246

Soochan! Hang in there.
Come on, hang in there.

Have you seen this before?

287
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,126
[Doc Hong] No.
I've never seen anything like this.

288
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,504
I think…

289
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,591
he has to stay away from us.
[breathing heavily]

290
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,970
We can't afford
to lose anyone else right now.

291
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,766
We should move him to the main lab.
[sighs]

292
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,728
And I'll do an autopsy
once I have him there.

293
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,984
Should I talk to Chief Gong about this?

294
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,695
[sighs]
I'll talk to him.

295

I'm sorry.

300
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,485
We are…

301
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,738
gonna have to do an autopsy,
you understand?

Dr. Hong.

307
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,306
Yeah?

308
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,103
Is there a way to find out everything
that happened in the other mission?

309
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,648
What are you saying?

310
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,318
There's data storage…

311
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,863
somewhere in this station.

[door opening]

313
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,162
So how long will this take?

314
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,916
The autopsy itself
will take one to two hours.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,837
But it will take me a while
to find the exact cause of death.

316
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,091
I'll inspect the medical records
and the other bodies.

317
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,884
Very well.

318
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,178
What else do you need from me?

319
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,682
I just need your permission
to conduct an investigation.

320
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,642
I thought you didn't need my permission.

321
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,228
You've been doing whatever you like.

322
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,400
After everything that's happened,
don't you get it?

323
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,988
We can't get any answers
if we don't ask questions.

But we still have a mission to do.

-You have to remember that.
-Captain…

329
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,183
Can we just call it quits?

330
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,645
We don't know why Soochan died
or what it was that killed him.

331
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,359
The culprit got away
through ventilation shaft INP-07.

332
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
It passes through
all the key facilities of this station.

333
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,408
Soohyuk and E2, you'll search with me.

334
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,995
Taesuk and Heesun,
get us connected at any cost.

335
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:01,166
We'll call for backup
after all of that is over with.

336
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,001
Yes, Captain.

It has to be tough on the captain as well.

But for now,

341
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,565
we've got to do our jobs
as best as we can.

They look like rocks, right?

356

But these ones are real.

[Heesun] Meteorites fall on Earth,

but they don't get harmed.

360
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,884
So we wear these as a bid to our survival.

361
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,928
We put our trust in the universe.

Also Soochan had one of these.

364
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,894
I survived.

365
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,854
Why couldn't he as well?

366
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,440
[Taesuk] Why would you believe
something like that?

367
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,777
-Huh?
-[Taesuk] Think about it.

368
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,365
If you die, you die.
If you live, then you live.

369
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,325
There's no fate in the universe.

370
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,745
[sighs]

371
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,873
[Soohyuk] The machine room is the closest.

372
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,458
The dormitory is down the hall.

373
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,754
I'll take the lead. E2, you stay back.

374
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,963
Yeah, I got it, sir.

375
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,135
-[breathing deeply]
-[footsteps thumping]

376
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,736
[squelching]

377
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,243
[unsettling music]

378
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,453
[squelching continues]

379
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,834
[Dr. Song] There are logs
up until before the accident,

380
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,293
but I see no leads.

381
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,171
In that case,

382
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,675
don't you think they really died
because of the radiation?

383
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,512
[suspenseful music]

384
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,442
SONG WONKYUNG, LEVEL 1

385
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,610
[suspenseful music continues]

386
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,071
[chimes, beeps]

387
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,495
[sighs]
I can't watch this.

388
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,875
[E1] Found anything yet?

389
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,129
Some of the files have been locked up.

390
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,381
Uh-huh.

391
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,717
[E1] You can't look at the records
of the higher-ups.

392
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,552
Yeah, I guess so.

393
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,019
Showing the same symptoms,
on the same day…

394
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,481
-It happens quickly.
-[E1 sighs]

395
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,107
And has a high death rate.

396
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,569
[gasping]

397
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,701
I think we should gather as much tissue
as we can from the other bodies.

398
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,039
So I'll be able to trace back
to when Soochan's symptoms broke out.

399
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,501
Are you saying you're going
to go look at the bodies?

400
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,339
I can go alone.
You can stay here with Dr. Hong.

401
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,800
[sighs]

402
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,763
You cannot do this on your own. I'll come.

403
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,817
Can I leave you here for a minute?

404
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,194
[Doc Hong] Mm-hm. See you later.

405
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,450
[inhales]

406
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,453

[unsettling music continues]

412
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,750
[Soohyuk] Captain.

413

417
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,226
[E2] Captain.

418
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,770
I see someone approaching from the front.

419
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,399
[tense music]

420
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,027
Are you sure?

421
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,947
-Yeah, they're ahead of us.
-[signal beeping]

422
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,616

[rapid beeping]

425
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,331
It just passed by us.

426
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,543
[muffled footsteps]

427
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,674
It's moving forward, back towards us!

428
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,887
[E2] To the left. To the left.

429
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,972
[tense music rises]

430
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,645

[squelches]

433
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,905
[E1] He didn't look too well.

434
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,573
He was sweating profusely,

435
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,575
and he fell behind.

436
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,745
[E1] <i>He would space out</i>
<i>and just look at the wall.</i>

437
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,916
<i>He was acting pretty weirdly.</i>

438
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,126
[E1] Hold on.

439
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,254
I think I was in contact with him too.

440
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,675
This isn't contagious or anything, right?

441
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,011
[Doc Hong over earpiece]
<i>Dr. Song, I need you in here for a second.</i>

442
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,516
[Dr. Song] Why?
I'm still collecting the samples.

443
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,767
[Doc Hong] <i>It won't take long.</i>

444
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,894
[E1] Sure thing.
I'll be there in a couple of minutes.

445
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,855
[Doc Hong] <i>I don't need you.</i>
<i>I just need Dr. Song, please.</i>

446
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,983
<i>You can stay and do your work.</i>

447
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,069
[E1] Well, I don't have much
to do here, so I'll…

448
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,404
[Dr. Song] I'll be back shortly.

449
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
[E1] Dr. Song!

468
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,433
[E1] Dr. Song.

469
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,939
What's going on with you?

470
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,691
Nothing. Let's go.

471
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,404
Dr. Song, is this really contagious?

472
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,948
I'm feeling itchy.

473
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,951
[grunting]

474
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,995

00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,834
What's in here?

477
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,837
There's no indicator that
it's one of our facilities, Captain.

478
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,423
It's located right next
to the machine room.

479
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,512
-[Taesuk over earpiece] <i>Captain.</i>
-[chimes]

480
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,889
Are comms back up?

481
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,602
[Taesuk] <i>I found a way to fix it,</i>
<i>but things aren't looking too good.</i>

482
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
[Captain Han] Got it.

483
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,608
Head back to the command center.

484
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,818
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

485
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,780
-[breathing heavily]
-[footsteps receding]

486
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,242
[E1] Everyone here

487
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,829
came down with the same sort of sickness.

488
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,000
How else would they have ended up
like this, do you know?

489
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,501
[E1 sighs]

490
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,089
[clattering]

[door slides]

495
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,267
Here I am, Dr. Hong.

496
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,769
[sighs]

497
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,813
I thought we should look into
as many things as we can.

498
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,317
[door slides close]

499
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,779
The results came out just as I expected.

500
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,698
I found mucus
surrounding the bronchial tubes,

501
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,201
and, uh, there were signs of water

502
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,995
seeping through his organs.

503
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,248
His body was completely filled with water.

504
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,249
So…

505
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,584
he essentially drowned to death?

506
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,044
Yeah.

507
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,047
[Doc Hong] There's no external damage.
He's all clean.

508
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,968
That means the water
must have come from the inside,

509
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,930
and it happened so suddenly
that his bronchial tubes are swollen.

510
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,475
Other bodies shared similar symptoms.

511
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,519
[Doc Hong sighs]

512
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,521
I've never seen anything like this before.

513
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,522
[chuckles]

514
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,232
Where did all that water
come from, anyway?

515
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,025
Have you ever seen anything like this?

516
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,694
[sighs]

517
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,575
[pensive music]

518
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,336
[sighs]

519
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,964
There's nothing here.

520
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,135
What do you mean there's nothing there?

521
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,137
There is nothing abnormal.

522
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,933
There are no viruses or bacteria,

523
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,185
or toxins related to disease.

524
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,230
The crew was all in very good health.

525
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,024
[machine beeping]

526
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,735
[machine beeping, whirring]

527
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,157
[suspenseful music]

528
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,994
Look at this.

529
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,496
This here is Soochan's blood.

530
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,709
[Doc Hong] Look at that right there.

531
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,502
[Dr. Song] In the blood?

532
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,795
What could it be?

533
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,678
There's a problem with the digital unit
connected to the communications tower.

534
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,724
We're going to need someone
to fix the equipment about the same time

535
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,102
someone else edits the protocol,
so then we can reboot the system.

536
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,146
[Taesuk] But I'm the only engineer
on this mission,

537
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,273
and I can't do all this by myself.

538
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,361
Is this the unit you mean?

539
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,446
Yeah. But there's a problem with it.

540
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:30,242
All the station was up, everyone would use
the main elevator to get to the unit,

541
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,536
but it's out of order,
so we need to find another way.

542
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,873
The station was neglected
for five years after the accident.

543
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,625
That's probably why
there are some problems.

544
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,045
The only way to get there
is to go out to the gate,

545
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:44,673
then grab the elevator rail
and climb down. But that's just not--

546
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,009
We try setting up an anchor
and get down that way.

547
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,888
It won't be too hard.

548
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,139
No, you can't do that.

549
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,183
It's better to wait
until the rescue ship comes.

550
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,185
-It's way too dangerous.
-I'll do it.

551
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,191
Tell me what I need to do there.

552
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,484
Will you be all right?

553
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,197
I have to reach Director Choi
as soon as I can.

554
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,412
[ominous music]

555
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,749
[footsteps receding]

556
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,335
[sloshing]

557
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,099
[door opening]

558
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,519
Did you find the root cause?

559
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,689
We're analyzing Soochan's blood
at the moment.

560
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,900
Once comms are up and running,

561
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,069
I'll make a reinvestigation request
to the accident

562
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,237
on behalf of Director Choi.

563
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,074
Only if we have enough samples, though.

564
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,995
So to do that, we need to find out
how Soochan died.

565
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,830
Yeah.

566
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,207
[Doc Hong] Captain.

567
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,376
Are you really gonna go?

568
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,253
Yeah.

569
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,799
[door beeps, slides open]

570
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,967
Captain Han, wait.

571
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,183
There's something I'm concerned about.

572
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,228
It's the intruder.

573
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,356
It did not try to hurt me.

574
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,109
How can you be so sure of that?

575
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,819
[Dr. Song]
It's called "critical distance."

576
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,617
<i>When animals find intruders,</i>
<i>they watch them at first.</i>

577
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,537
Then they attack them
when they come into a certain distance.

578
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,583
That's why it's very important
that you don't get too close.

579
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,294
On top of that,
it moves by using the shafts,

580
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,048
and escapes because it's always
a step ahead of us.

581
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,175
It seems like they're familiar

582
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,427
with this entire place.

583
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,846
Are you suggesting it could be a survivor?

584
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,973
[suspenseful music]

585
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,892
[sighs]

586
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,145
The government would have known
if one of the crew had survived.

587
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,482
It's been five years. It seems impossible.

588
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,526
How could there be a survivor?

589
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,528
It's not so impossible.

590
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,864
The radiation turned out
to be completely normal.

591
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,992
So if they rationed their food
and their water,

592
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,328
there's a chance they'd survive.

593
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,289
And tell me why haven't they informed us
of any of this before?

594
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,669
If this wasn't an intruder,
there'd be no reason to steal the sample.

595
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,920
If they survived…

596
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,465
they'd be welcoming us, not attacking.

597
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,634
[suspenseful music continues]

598
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,887

599
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,889
