48
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,571
So we've now confirmed
she can survive contact with lunar water?

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,366
[Doc Hong] Looks like it.

50
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,161
Lunar water has similar characteristics
to a virus that changes each time

51
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,955
it comes into contact with a new host.

52
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,750
As we can see,
a pretty major change took place

53
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,711
when it came into contact
with this girl here.

54
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,964
Or at least contact
with whatever they put inside her.

55
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,465
These researchers…

56
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,013
at Balhae Station, studied cell fusion
and genetic recombination

57
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,181
as ways to make humans
survive lunar water.

58
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,311
And the organism they created as a result

59
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,646
is named Luna.

60
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,027
Human experiments and human cloning,

61
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,321
both illegal.

62
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,407
[Doc Hong scoffs]
So that means…

63
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,286
the reason the government
shut down this station five years ago

64
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,913
was because they cared more
about hiding the experiments

65
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,123
than about the results.

66
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,251
[Doc Hong] If this gets out,
it'll cause a panic. I mean, shit.

67
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,963
It's considered an act of treason
for us to disclose state secrets

68
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,548
no matter what the secrets are.

69
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,050
[scoffs]

70
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,930
You realize, even if we swear
to never speak of this again,

71
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,309
no one in charge will believe us
for the rest of our lives!

72
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,227
People will watch our every move,

73
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,813
or we might just end up dead
like the crew members here!

74
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,483
That's why Director Choi wanted me here.

75
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,069
[Dr. Song sighs]

76
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,487
I see the logic.

77
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,198
She probably thought
I wouldn't be able to tell the truth.

78
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,703
The atrocious crimes my sister committed
as head researcher.

We aren't safe here anymore.
Something's wrong.

83
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,100
A shaft blew up

[Doc Hong] I think…

141
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,769
possibly, Luna's DNA,

142
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,647
it acts like a sort of antibody.

143
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,109
It suppresses the multiplication
of lunar water in your body.

144
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,277
It could be you're just lucky.

were both working for RX.

158
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,558
We should head to Gate Seven.

159
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,936
Shouldn't we hold our position
until the backup team arrives here?

160

[Captain Han] We're out of time.

161
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,234
I need to speak with Mr. Kim.

162
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,869
[Mr. Kim] The rescue party's spacecraft
has entered the Moon's orbit.

163
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,080
<i>We just checked the radar,</i>
<i>and it's just like you said.</i>

<i>We spotted another vessel</i>
<i>entering orbit as well.</i>

165
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,129
It's a model used by RX Corporation,
which means mercenaries are aboard.

166
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,842
We're going to need more time
to retrieve the samples.

167
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,304
If the mercenaries make their landing,
we won't be able to get them.

168
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,808
Any measures you can take to delay them
would be extremely helpful.

169
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,437
[Mr. Kim] <i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

170

What's going to happen to Luna?

<i>And once she's there…</i>

176
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,792
<i>the government will pick up the experiment</i>
<i>where the station left off.</i>

177
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,168
It's too dangerous.

178
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,129
Lunar water is extremely unstable.

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,799
[Dr. Song] It could threaten the life
of everyone on Earth.

180
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>And if Luna is sent to a facility,</i>

181
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,469
you know what that means.

182

There's no way those people
will ever leave her alone.

252

That's her fate.
Her location won't make any difference.
