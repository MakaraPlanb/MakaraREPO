Why don't we go and find out?

[Heesun] What's with
all the plants in here?

00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,387
It's a jungle.

31
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,142
Are we sure it's safe for us
to just walk in here?

32
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,478
[Soohyuk] This facility
wasn't on the station's blueprint.

33
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,531
[Heesun] Check out the size
of some of these. It's incredible.

00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
[E1] You're right.

35
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,120
I've never even seen plants
grow like this back on Earth.

36
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,082
[Heesun] Why did they try
to keep this place so secret?

37
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,293
How did they even manage to do all this?

[laughs]

49
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,304
[Doc Hong] So that's what happened.
They hid everything down here.

50
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,056
Hey, what's this?

51
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,353
It's likely…

52
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,398
this facility is independent
from the rest of the station.

53

How does all this grow
with this little water?

56
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,534
It doesn't make any sense.

57
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,494
Doesn't matter how it happened.

58
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,664
We'd have all the water
we'd ever need with this stuff.

59
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,166
Only if we can keep it under control.

-Yes, Captain.

I'd say most samples are intact.

[E1] There's a ton over there.

80
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,792

Check the medical kit over there.
Bring me all type B blood bags.

Two bags here.

155
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,769
That's not going to be enough.
We need someone to give.

156
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,064
We need more type B blood.

157
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,608

Yeah.

[exhales sharply]

166
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,277
Bad enough with poison water around,
and now a monster decided to show up?

167
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,447
It was probably the same creature
that killed Gisu.

168
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,366
Yes. I think it was.

169
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,120
But… but why is she following us
around the station?

170
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,329
Is she trying to kill us?

171
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,914
I think it's the lunar water.

172
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,251
Huh?

173
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,670
I think that's why she killed Gisu,

174
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,630
and why attacked us.

175
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,342
Whenever we find lunar water,
she shows up.

176
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,013
Perhaps she's after it as well.

177
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,806
Do you think…

178
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,308
it's possible that she's a survivor?

179
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,560
[Heesun] A survivor?

180
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,187

00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,565
I don't think a kid
could survive long on their own.

182
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,066
She was a kid. We all saw.

183
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,776
It was behaving like a child

184
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,154
[Dr. Song] A child who wanted
to keep what's hers.

185
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,739
Who didn't want it taken away.

186
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,282
I know it sounds odd, but…

187
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,494
a child behaves like that.

188
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,914
From her perspective, we're the intruders.

189
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,795
[girl breathing heavily]

190
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,856
Just like the first time,

191
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,984
her attacks have come
from the ventilation shaft.

192
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,653
You can get pretty much anywhere on board

193
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,364
by using this main shaft INP-07.

194
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,784
We're connected, Captain.
Whenever you're ready.

196
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,495
Did you find her?

197
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,247
[Captain Han] <i>She escaped</i>
<i>and we lost track of her.</i>

198
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,961
And the samples?

199
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,129
[Captain Han sighs]

200
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,721
Let's end this before we lose
anyone else from the crew.

201
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,847
You'll get your samples.

202
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,807
<i>I already told you,</i>

203
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,560
<i>this operation will become a failure</i>
<i>if anyone else gets the sample.</i>

204
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,023
[Director Choi] <i>Kill her if you have to.</i>
<i>She can't be allowed to go free.</i>

205
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,567
<i>Also, the samples you took,</i>

206
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>get it back from her.</i>

207
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,821
She's only a kid.

208
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,531
What?

209
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,408
It appears the intruder is a young child.

210
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,203
She was also wearing a lab coat.

211
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,788
<i>What's your point?</i>

212
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,041
Is there any possibility
that she survived the accident?

213
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,085
[laughs]

214
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,212

00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,675

<i>than it should be.</i>

216
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>Just focus on what's important.</i>

217
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,929
[Director Choi] <i>Forget about who she is.</i>

218
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>It doesn't affect your mission.</i>

219
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,769
<i>You know…</i>

220
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>sometimes, I…</i>

221
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>I dream of standing in the rain.</i>

222
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,988
And when I wake up
from that wonderful dream,

223
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,658
I feel indescribable pain,

224
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
facing our horrible world.

225
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,999
<i>We must make sure it rains…</i>

226
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,168
once again.

227
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,045
That's the world I dream of.

228
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,173
A world where water flows endlessly.

229
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,758
<i>We must…</i>

230
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>must make that world a reality.</i>

231
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,930
[Director Choi] <i>Go.</i>

232
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,349
<i>I'll send you backup very soon.</i>

233
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,643
<i>Just hold on a little longer.</i>

236
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,624
[Dr. Song] The director got to you,
didn't she?

237
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,877
Tell me the reason why I can't go
back down there to investigate.

238
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,503
It's too dangerous to go back in.

239
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,049
For all we know, the lunar water
is still multiplying.

240
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm close to an answer.

241
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,511
And you want me to give up now?

242
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,096
I want you to survive this.

243
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,104
[sighs]
We can't lose another.

244
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,359
Once, there were 87 people
aboard this station.

245
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,194
Not one of them survived.

246
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,655
If we don't know what we're taking back,

247
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,449
we could end up losing everyone.

248
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,536
The answer won't matter.

249
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,330
Whatever we do, they'll take it back.

250
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
And that kid with it.

251
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,336
All the more reason to risk getting
what we need while there's a chance.

252
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,547
We know just how dangerous
lunar water could be.

253
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,591
Understanding it is our responsibility.

254
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,179
I don't care if you don't trust me.

255
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,848
I'm not doing any of this
for personal reasons.

258
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,529
If you're really so deadset…

259
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,782
just make sure to bring Doc Hong as well.

260
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,662

report back as soon as you're able.

If you feel it up before we return,
call me and I'll head back.

274
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,779
Yeah. You got it.

the lunar water research data is there?

281
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,506

I'm praying that's the case.

282
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,882
[Doc Hong] I really am.

283
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,926

We should expand our search

358
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,222
I know. But it seems more like
we've just been circling the same area.

359
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,515
[Soohyuk] Exactly.

360
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,642
It's like a game of hide-and-seek for her.

361
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,479
[Heesun] She knows exactly where we are
and always manages to avoid us.

362
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,065
She knows her way around here
much better than we do.

363
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,409
[Doc Hong] Who could have deleted this?

364
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,160
How and why?

365
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,747
[Doc Hong sighs]

366
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,875
[sighs]

367
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,391
[clanks]

368
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,571
Didn't I say to call me?

369
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,035
Don't worry. I feel okay.
Did you find any data?

370
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,661
What are you doing with the samples?

371
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,707
I thought you were supposed
to join the search?

372
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh, there's new orders.

373
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,545
We decided to regroup
at the command center.

374
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,463
[Doc Hong] Mm.

375
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,174
There could be a security issue
if we just leave these out here.

376
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,844
So I'm moving them
to the safety of the command center.

377
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,054
Why?

378
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,057
You heard this from Captain Han?

379
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,685
You said as much yourself,

380
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,856
the monster seems to be
after the lunar water, just like we are.

381
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,443
Don't worry. We're just being careful.

382
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,112
Just in case
anything unexpected were to happen.

383
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,448
Hold it.

384
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,743
I'm the one who decides
where the samples should go.

385
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,996
And we are going to keep that water
right where it is.

386
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,582
[scoffs]

387
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,586
I guess you would know.

388
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,423
Be sure to call me if anything happens.

389
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,185
Are there any more passages?
Something we missed or anything?

390
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,313
I'm not sure. I'll check again
once we reach the command center.

391
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,273
But why is this girl…

392
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,025
This monster…

393
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,529
Whatever you want to call it.
Why do we have to find her?

394
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,406
We have the sample.
We should just go home.

395
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,701
[ominous music]

396
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,171
[ominous music continues]

397
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,966
[shrieks]

398
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,218
[Doc Hong gasping]

399
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,728
[breathing heavily]

400
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,357
[Doc Hong] <i>Captain.</i>

401
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,608
<i>Captain!</i>

402
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>The girl, she's here.</i>

403
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,611
You have eyes on her?

404
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,739
Dr. Hong, respond.

405
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,282
[Doc Hong breathing heavily, shrieks]

406
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,783
[ominous music]

407
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,036
[panting]

408
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,621
Captain Han.

409
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,541
[breathing heavily]

410
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,093
[gunshots]

411
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,053
[gasps]

412
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,474
[grunts]

413
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,560
No, stop!

414
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,986
[breathing heavily]

415
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,409
[tense music]

416
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,420
[Captain Han] Dr. Song, step away.

417
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,172
Wait a second.

418
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,799
Don't come any closer.

419
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,769
[breathing heavily]

420
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,275
[tense music continues]

421
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,373
[tense music intensifies]

422
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,360
[closing theme music]

423
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,822
