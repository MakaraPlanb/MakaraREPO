The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:59.173 line:85.83%,end
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:03.970 line:85.83%,end
If you say yes,

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.556 line:85.83%,end
I will put an end to it at once.

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:27.034 line:85.83%,end
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:30.788 line:85.83%,end
I really appreciate it, sir!

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.617 line:14.17%,start
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:39.816 line:85.83%,end
How on earth…

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:42.276 line:85.83%,end
Weren't you

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.738 line:85.83%,end
being held hostage in the dorm?

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.831 line:85.83%,end
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:14.851 line:85.83%,end
Mother…

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:19.397 line:85.83%,end
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.940 line:85.83%,end
once again before she dies.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:27.321 line:85.83%,end
What do you need me to do?

01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:45.965 line:85.83%,end
They're all useless.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.968 line:85.83%,end
But I've picked out just a few

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:52.638 line:85.83%,end
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:05:00.021 line:85.83%,end
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.775 line:85.83%,end
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.861 line:85.83%,end
so you should never miss them.

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:08.905 line:85.83%,end
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:13.826 line:85.83%,end
"So precious," you say?

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.913 line:85.83%,end
That person will change your life

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:18.664 line:85.83%,end
completely.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.393 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Kim!

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.854 line:85.83%,end
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:48.069 line:85.83%,end
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:50.112 line:85.83%,end
I guess so.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:53.324 line:85.83%,end
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:55.284 line:85.83%,end
Yes. She's getting changed.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.912 line:85.83%,end
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:00.247 line:85.83%,end
Oh, is that so?

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:13.260 line:85.83%,end
She's a foreigner.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.440 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.907 line:85.83%,end
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.660 line:85.83%,end
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.
