00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:10.701 line:85.83%,end
That's not true, sir.

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:13.120 line:85.83%,end
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:15.414 line:85.83%,end
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:16.415 line:85.83%,end
<i>Disobeying?</i>

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.795 line:85.83%,end
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.172 line:85.83%,end
our country's fate?

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.842 line:85.83%,end
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.636 line:85.83%,end
I will, sir!

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.347 line:85.83%,end
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.973 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry a thing, sir!

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.266 line:85.83%,end
I swear on my life--

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.695 line:85.83%,end
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.406 line:85.83%,end
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:53.160 line:85.83%,end
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.206 line:85.83%,end
We have the upper hand now.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.249 line:85.83%,end
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.377 line:85.83%,end
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.547 line:85.83%,end
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.508 line:85.83%,end
Then cut off the power.

00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:10.511 line:85.83%,end
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.805 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.408 line:14.17%,start
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:41.125 line:85.83%,end
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.713 line:85.83%,end
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.297 line:85.83%,end
Who did such a horrible thing?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:48.841 line:85.83%,end
It must be Nam Tae-il.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.093 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il?

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.345 line:85.83%,end
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:57.766 line:85.83%,end
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:00.978 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:02.980 line:85.83%,end
<i>Well,</i>

00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:07.568 line:85.83%,end
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:10.738 line:85.83%,end
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.698 line:85.83%,end
<i>and we have decided</i>

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.366 line:14.17%,start
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.618 line:85.83%,end
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.162 line:85.83%,end
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.831 line:14.17%,start
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:25.294 line:85.83%,end
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.379 line:85.83%,end
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.757 line:85.83%,end
They're making up

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:34.178 line:85.83%,end
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:37.222 line:85.83%,end
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:38.515 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.017 line:85.83%,end
That's obvious.

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:43.979 line:85.83%,end
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.108 line:85.83%,end
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:53.947 line:85.83%,end
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.532 line:85.83%,end
Then…

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.576 line:85.83%,end
will it be tonight?

00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:59.661 line:85.83%,end
We should get ready to fight right now.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.250 line:85.83%,end
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:36.865 line:85.83%,end
To the library?

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.284 line:85.83%,end
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.203 line:85.83%,end
What do we do now?

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.497 line:85.83%,end
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.457 line:85.83%,end
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.709 line:85.83%,end
Really?

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.379 line:85.83%,end
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:53.215 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.342 line:85.83%,end
He was shot?

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.302 line:85.83%,end
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:02.474 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.685 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.108 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro!

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:23.245 line:85.83%,end
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:27.332 line:85.83%,end
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.501 line:14.17%,start
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:32.087 line:85.83%,end
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.464 line:85.83%,end
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.885 line:85.83%,end
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.387 line:85.83%,end
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.640 line:85.83%,end
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.726 line:85.83%,end
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:49.855 line:85.83%,end
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>
