00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:02.493 line:85.83%,end
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of moneyâ€¦

00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:05.955 line:85.83%,end
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:07.790 line:85.83%,end
who wants us dead.

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:10.376 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:14.589 line:85.83%,end
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:16.382 line:85.83%,end
But how on earth

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.093 line:85.83%,end
will we cut off the money?

00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:25.183 line:85.83%,end
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:32.481 line:85.83%,end
Look, doctor.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:37.361 line:85.83%,end
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:42.491 line:85.83%,end
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:43.993 line:85.83%,end
And you'll take it from him?

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.872 line:85.83%,end
As you all know,

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:52.752 line:85.83%,end
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:58.341 line:85.83%,end
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

00:36:59.258 --> 00:37:04.388 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.057 line:85.83%,end
and how it's managed.

00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:12.396 line:85.83%,end
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

00:37:14.607 --> 00:37:18.110 line:85.83%,end
But will it be enough to make it work?

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:21.447 line:85.83%,end
An's wife is quite easy to handle

00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:24.700 line:85.83%,end
because she's very greedy.

00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:26.911 line:85.83%,end
And she has a head for managing money,

00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:30.039 line:85.83%,end
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:32.792 line:85.83%,end
That's true. An made quite big money

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.711 line:85.83%,end
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.673 line:85.83%,end
I heard him boasting about it.

00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:45.930 line:85.83%,end
I'll go out and intercept the money.

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:49.517 line:85.83%,end
As long as the money is our possession,

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.978 line:85.83%,end
they can never set off the bombs.

00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:57.108 line:85.83%,end
Can I have a word?

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:10.037 line:85.83%,end
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:13.207 line:85.83%,end
Can't you see what she's up to?

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:15.209 line:85.83%,end
She wants to get out of here.

00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:19.297 line:85.83%,end
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:23.342 line:85.83%,end
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:28.306 line:85.83%,end
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:31.809 line:85.83%,end
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:34.729 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:40.151 line:85.83%,end
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:44.989 line:85.83%,end
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:51.537 line:85.83%,end
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

00:38:55.374 --> 00:38:56.500 line:85.83%,end
All right, fine.

00:38:57.626 --> 00:38:59.795 line:85.83%,end
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:01.881 line:85.83%,end
that large amount of money.

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.258 line:85.83%,end
She's coming back here with it?

00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:06.177 line:85.83%,end
Do you believe that?

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:08.596 line:85.83%,end
Or are you pretending to?

00:39:11.974 --> 00:39:13.559 line:85.83%,end
Whichever the case,

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.771 line:85.83%,end
do you have any other plan?

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.064 line:85.83%,end
As soon as she gets out--

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.525 line:85.83%,end
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.864 line:85.83%,end
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:29.909 line:85.83%,end
How?

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.036 line:85.83%,end
How will you?

00:39:34.288 --> 00:39:36.582 line:85.83%,end
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:39.919 line:85.83%,end
who got Eun shot right now.

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:43.297 line:85.83%,end
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.257 line:85.83%,end
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.639 line:85.83%,end
As you say,

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.060 line:85.83%,end
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.106 line:85.83%,end
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.318 line:85.83%,end
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

00:40:05.152 --> 00:40:08.614 line:85.83%,end
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:12.952 line:85.83%,end
So we have

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:15.871 line:85.83%,end
a 50-50 chance?

00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:23.504 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:28.259 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.010 line:85.83%,end
Han-na, do you copy?

00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:33.222 line:85.83%,end
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.434 line:85.83%,end
VIP WARD

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.327 line:85.83%,end
Excuse me.

00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:57.079 line:85.83%,end
How can I get to the VIP ward?

00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:59.748 line:85.83%,end
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?
