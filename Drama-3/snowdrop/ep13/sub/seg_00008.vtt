00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.333 line:85.83%,end
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:03.544 line:85.83%,end
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.379 line:85.83%,end
Doctor.

00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:09.592 line:85.83%,end
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.303 line:85.83%,end
Of course. Don't worry too much.

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:16.974 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:18.517 line:85.83%,end
She asked for it.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.186 line:85.83%,end
Sure.

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:24.940 line:85.83%,end
She said I did?

00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.066 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:40.414 line:85.83%,end
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.709 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:15.199 line:85.83%,end
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:19.411 line:85.83%,end
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.583 line:85.83%,end
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

00:42:26.168 --> 00:42:28.671 line:85.83%,end
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.674 line:85.83%,end
I'll distract them

00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:34.802 line:85.83%,end
to help you come back in safely.

00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:39.765 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.143 line:85.83%,end
And now you're making sure I come back?

00:42:44.186 --> 00:42:45.354 line:85.83%,end
To be honest,

00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:48.274 line:85.83%,end
I still hope

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:51.193 line:85.83%,end
you'll stop being used like me…

00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:55.364 line:85.83%,end
and leave for another country

00:42:57.032 --> 00:42:59.159 line:85.83%,end
to live a happy life.

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:06.166 line:85.83%,end
But you need to come back

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.211 line:85.83%,end
for the hostages,

00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:11.380 line:85.83%,end
my comrades,

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.676 line:85.83%,end
and my sister Su-hui to live.

00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:20.264 line:85.83%,end
Are you

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.309 line:85.83%,end
scared that I might…

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:29.315 line:85.83%,end
not come back?

00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:38.115 line:85.83%,end
Then give me…

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.203 line:85.83%,end
a reason I must

00:43:45.205 --> 00:43:46.624 line:85.83%,end
come back.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.462 line:85.83%,end
For instance,

00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.009 line:85.83%,end
"If you come back with the money,

00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:06.352 line:85.83%,end
I will leave with you to another country."

00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:12.733 line:85.83%,end
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:18.781 line:85.83%,end
But if I can leave with you…

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.966 line:85.83%,end
Eun's wife is already moving.

00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:44.014 line:85.83%,end
You should get ready.

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.987 line:85.83%,end
Think carefully.

00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:02.157 line:85.83%,end
This is

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.912 line:85.83%,end
the only way you'll live.

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:10.374 line:85.83%,end
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.251 line:85.83%,end
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:13.293 line:85.83%,end
-Salute!
-Salute!

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.503 line:85.83%,end
Understand, you bastard?

00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:15.838 line:85.83%,end
-Ma'am!
-What?

00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.473 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing here?

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.642 line:85.83%,end
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:35.441 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:37.651 line:85.83%,end
She practically threatened me

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.154 line:85.83%,end
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:43.365 line:85.83%,end
What? Eun's wife really did that?

00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:44.491 line:85.83%,end
-Salute!
-Salute!

00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:46.326 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam.
