EPISODE 13

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.822 line:14.17%,start
I'll go in first.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:17.327 line:14.17%,start
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.746 line:14.17%,start
We must kill him.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.332 line:14.17%,start
Understood, sir.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:37.639 line:14.17%,start
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.392 line:14.17%,start
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.562 line:85.83%,end
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:49.526 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.035 line:85.83%,end
I'm back, sir.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.249 line:85.83%,end
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.670 line:85.83%,end
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.839 line:85.83%,end
for our country and people.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.341 line:85.83%,end
He only cares about saving his daughter.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.760 line:85.83%,end
We can't leave our fate to him.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.846 line:85.83%,end
If the election scheme succeeds,

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.307 line:85.83%,end
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.895 line:85.83%,end
You must climb the ladder

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.149 line:85.83%,end
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.777 line:85.83%,end
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.530 line:85.83%,end
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:37.991 line:85.83%,end
Good.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.558 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.450 line:85.83%,end
Dad.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.368 line:85.83%,end
Yes?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.499 line:85.83%,end
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.418 line:85.83%,end
Of course not.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.466 line:85.83%,end
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.136 line:85.83%,end
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.972 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.142 line:85.83%,end
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.770 line:85.83%,end
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.983 line:85.83%,end
It's all my fault.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.360 line:85.83%,end
No, it's not.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.862 line:85.83%,end
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:00.990 line:85.83%,end
And my brother…

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.327 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u…

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.623 line:85.83%,end
died because of me.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.797 line:85.83%,end
If my friends die too,

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:17.715 line:85.83%,end
I won't be able to…

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.758 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.218 line:85.83%,end
Please…

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.514 line:85.83%,end
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.598 line:85.83%,end
Don't move!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.486 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro!

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.413 line:85.83%,end
No!

00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:58.589 line:85.83%,end
Were you only going to save me?

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.469 line:85.83%,end
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?
