00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.222 line:85.83%,end
What? What the hell is she doing?

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:08.641 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.228 line:85.83%,end
Your brother asked me to protect you.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.440 line:85.83%,end
While drawing his last breath,

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.323 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.038 line:85.83%,end
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.292 line:85.83%,end
Can't you understand that?

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.010 line:85.83%,end
Open fire!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.977 line:85.83%,end
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.771 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. Follow me.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.439 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.648 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.025 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:00.401 line:85.83%,end
-You, with me!
-Wait.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.944 line:85.83%,end
What about us?

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.323 line:85.83%,end
Come in!

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.241 line:85.83%,end
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.201 line:85.83%,end
Move back!

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.535 line:85.83%,end
Don't shoot!

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:14.499 line:85.83%,end
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.959 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell is shooting?

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.800 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.385 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.178 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:28.930 line:85.83%,end
It's okay.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:30.139 line:85.83%,end
You're safe.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.189 line:85.83%,end
Hold fire!

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.192 line:85.83%,end
Kill him.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:44.028 line:85.83%,end
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:01.879 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun!

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.423 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun!

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.092 line:85.83%,end
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.262 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.557 line:85.83%,end
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.684 line:85.83%,end
Damn it!

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:15.935 line:85.83%,end
We need a medical team.

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:17.270 line:85.83%,end
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:18.604 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.064 line:85.83%,end
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.357 line:85.83%,end
Move faster!

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.258 line:85.83%,end
I was worried
something had happened to you.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.510 line:85.83%,end
I was quite scared.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.846 line:85.83%,end
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.097 line:85.83%,end
We're all going to die?

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.099 line:85.83%,end
Watch what you say.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.476 line:85.83%,end
Shut your own mouth.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.395 line:85.83%,end
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.814 line:85.83%,end
and you beg your enemy for your life?

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.700 line:85.83%,end
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.620 line:85.83%,end
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.876 line:85.83%,end
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:23.544 line:85.83%,end
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.631 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.512 line:85.83%,end
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.680 line:85.83%,end
Search the room for lanterns.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.974 line:85.83%,end
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.644 line:85.83%,end
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.108 line:85.83%,end
By yourself?

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:51.239 line:85.83%,end
Untie me.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.450 line:85.83%,end
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.826 line:85.83%,end
You can't, Comrade Lim.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.372 line:85.83%,end
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.460 line:85.83%,end
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.004 line:85.83%,end
Understood.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:27.358 line:85.83%,end
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.449 line:85.83%,end
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.245 line:85.83%,end
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.625 line:85.83%,end
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us allâ€¦

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.547 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.217 line:85.83%,end
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:00.933 line:85.83%,end
The radio.

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:02.977 line:85.83%,end
I should find it first.
