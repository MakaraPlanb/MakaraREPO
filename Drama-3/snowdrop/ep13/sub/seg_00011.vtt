00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:44.359 line:85.83%,end
-Careful.
-Damn it.

00:56:45.777 --> 00:56:47.278 line:85.83%,end
Turn on the lights. There.

00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.324 line:85.83%,end
You're home!

00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:54.327 line:85.83%,end
I'm so relieved.

00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:57.414 line:85.83%,end
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:56:58.373 --> 00:57:01.960 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:07.215 line:85.83%,end
That hurts so much.

00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:11.594 line:85.83%,end
Do you know how much I resented you?

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:13.972 line:85.83%,end
I know I told you to leave,

00:57:14.055 --> 00:57:16.975 line:85.83%,end
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:19.227 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean, run?

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.146 line:85.83%,end
I was scared they might blow you up.

00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:24.983 line:85.83%,end
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

00:57:25.066 --> 00:57:27.694 line:85.83%,end
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.946 line:85.83%,end
I chose to retreat to save you.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.074 line:85.83%,end
God, do you know how sad I was?

00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:35.410 line:85.83%,end
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

00:57:35.493 --> 00:57:37.662 line:85.83%,end
So I decided to escape at all costs.

00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:41.249 line:85.83%,end
You did well. I've been thinking

00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:44.878 line:85.83%,end
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

00:57:45.587 --> 00:57:49.215 line:85.83%,end
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

00:57:50.341 --> 00:57:52.510 line:85.83%,end
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:54.053 line:85.83%,end
and shooting the ANSP director.

00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:56.598 line:85.83%,end
Those damn bastards.

00:57:56.681 --> 00:58:00.268 line:85.83%,end
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:03.563 line:85.83%,end
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:06.566 line:85.83%,end
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:08.860 line:85.83%,end
It must've been hard for you.

00:58:08.943 --> 00:58:10.445 line:85.83%,end
You did well.

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:14.824 line:85.83%,end
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:19.412 line:85.83%,end
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.164 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:46.189 line:85.83%,end
Dad…

00:58:58.743 --> 00:59:01.371 line:85.83%,end
Dad…

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:22.058 line:85.83%,end
Please… Dad…

00:59:56.217 --> 00:59:58.303 line:14.17%,start
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

00:59:58.386 --> 00:59:59.929 line:14.17%,start
Help the less fortunate.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.224 line:14.17%,start
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:07.395 line:85.83%,end
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.189 line:85.83%,end
We still have as many as six days left.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.777 line:85.83%,end
You're number two in the ANSP now.

01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:18.031 line:85.83%,end
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:22.118 line:85.83%,end
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:23.703 line:85.83%,end
A scam?

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.664 line:85.83%,end
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:32.003 line:85.83%,end
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:33.254 line:85.83%,end
With that much money,

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:37.342 line:85.83%,end
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.054 line:85.83%,end
-A hundred?
-Yes!

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.598 line:85.83%,end
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:46.893 line:85.83%,end
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:50.855 line:85.83%,end
The President?

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.821 line:85.83%,end
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:02.825 line:85.83%,end
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.329 line:85.83%,end
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:15.088 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.673 line:85.83%,end
Those bastards

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:18.633 line:85.83%,end
even strapped bombs

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:21.177 line:85.83%,end
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.554 line:85.83%,end
Will you keep letting me down?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.268 line:85.83%,end
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.770 line:85.83%,end
I apologize.

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.816 line:85.83%,end
But the truth is, because Director Eun

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.943 line:85.83%,end
failed to keep his man under control,

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.821 line:85.83%,end
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:44.033 line:85.83%,end
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.
