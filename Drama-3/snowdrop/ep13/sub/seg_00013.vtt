She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.033 line:85.83%,end
for a private equity fund that she made.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.493 line:85.83%,end
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.996 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure it is.

01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:31.714 line:85.83%,end
So only one spot's left?

01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:45.895 line:85.83%,end
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:47.104 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my.

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.108 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. Thank you so much.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.903 line:85.83%,end
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:05.873 line:85.83%,end
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:09.502 line:85.83%,end
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.838 line:85.83%,end
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.549 line:85.83%,end
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.718 line:85.83%,end
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:02.513 line:85.83%,end
I did everything you told me to do.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:06.600 line:85.83%,end
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:08.978 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il…

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:11.856 line:85.83%,end
must not find out.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.691 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:17.361 line:85.83%,end
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:22.116 line:85.83%,end
You were very lucky.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.743 line:85.83%,end
He said only 13 people would die…

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:30.207 line:85.83%,end
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.502 line:85.83%,end
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:36.005 line:85.83%,end
just graze your ribs a little?

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.507 line:85.83%,end
The deity kept you safe.

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:41.510 line:85.83%,end
Now…

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:48.642 line:85.83%,end
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.486 line:85.83%,end
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.238 line:85.83%,end
Keep up the good work.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:03.699 line:85.83%,end
I've got to say,

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.911 line:85.83%,end
she's a good luck charm.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.663 line:85.83%,end
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.498 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:15.377 line:85.83%,end
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.591 line:85.83%,end
My God.

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:23.344 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:25.221 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:31.227 line:85.83%,end
Just when I was about to call you!

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:34.772 line:85.83%,end
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

01:10:34.855 --> 01:10:37.441 line:85.83%,end
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:40.486 line:85.83%,end
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.488 line:85.83%,end
How about the Maldives?

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.866 line:85.83%,end
You precious little fox.

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:47.868 line:85.83%,end
Sure.

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:50.287 line:85.83%,end
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:52.539 line:85.83%,end
Really? You really mean it?

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.376 line:85.83%,end
Tell me your passport number then.

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:57.711 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:02.967 line:85.83%,end
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.762 line:85.83%,end
I know. Me too.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.565 line:85.83%,end
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.278 line:85.83%,end
I'd like to open a secret account.

01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:27.116 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.827 line:85.83%,end
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.124 line:85.83%,end
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.627 line:85.83%,end
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:44.466 line:85.83%,end
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.260 line:85.83%,end
Arrest her?

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.887 line:85.83%,end
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.183 line:85.83%,end
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.019 line:85.83%,end
Who said anything about the agency?

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:58.939 line:85.83%,end
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.942 line:85.83%,end
That's the only way to save the hostages

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.195 line:85.83%,end
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.
