00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.233 line:85.83%,end
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.028 line:85.83%,end
How's Eun?

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.281 line:85.83%,end
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:16.282 line:85.83%,end
So?

00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:19.076 line:85.83%,end
Is he going to make it or not?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.288 line:85.83%,end
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.831 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure he'll make it.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.918 line:85.83%,end
"What happened?"

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.047 line:85.83%,end
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.423 line:85.83%,end
Are you seriously asking?

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.592 line:85.83%,end
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.304 line:85.83%,end
and those damn spies got him.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.974 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.103 line:85.83%,end
I mean, last time--

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:51.192 line:85.83%,end
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:54.070 line:85.83%,end
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.780 line:85.83%,end
You still think he wouldn't do it?

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.991 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.792 line:85.83%,end
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.461 line:85.83%,end
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.004 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.100 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.560 line:85.83%,end
Hello, doctor. How are you?

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:30.690 line:85.83%,end
He's been shot?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.692 line:85.83%,end
How is he?

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:37.738 line:85.83%,end
You must save him. Please.

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.532 line:85.83%,end
Okay. I'll be right over.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.623 line:85.83%,end
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:52.002 line:85.83%,end
But they shot the ANSP director?

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:55.131 line:85.83%,end
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.759 line:85.83%,end
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.594 line:85.83%,end
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.096 line:85.83%,end
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.015 line:85.83%,end
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.519 line:85.83%,end
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:11.188 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.732 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.151 line:85.83%,end
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:17.862 line:85.83%,end
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:20.322 line:85.83%,end
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.872 line:85.83%,end
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.583 line:85.83%,end
Until we figure out what's going on,

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.502 line:85.83%,end
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.923 line:85.83%,end
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.182 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.690 line:85.83%,end
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.234 line:85.83%,end
My hunch is

00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:01.197 line:85.83%,end
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.116 line:85.83%,end
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:06.202 line:85.83%,end
If that's true,

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.371 line:85.83%,end
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.170 line:85.83%,end
Go to the prayer room.

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:35.856 line:85.83%,end
Right. To the prayer room…

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.275 line:85.83%,end
The prayer room.

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:57.503 line:85.83%,end
No!

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.583 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.045 line:85.83%,end
No one's going to die.

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.757 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:14:59.773 line:85.83%,end
I apologize, sir.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.609 line:85.83%,end
I tried so hard to stop him,

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.652 line:85.83%,end
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.779 line:85.83%,end
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:09.408 line:85.83%,end
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!
