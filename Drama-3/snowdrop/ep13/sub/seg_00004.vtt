00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:45.285 line:85.83%,end
I told you to move in lines!

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.496 line:85.83%,end
Move in lines!

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:49.831 line:85.83%,end
Move in lines!

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.377 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:55.712 line:85.83%,end
My dadâ€¦

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.923 line:85.83%,end
How did my dad get shot?

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.051 line:85.83%,end
Go stay in the library. Now!

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:02.469 line:85.83%,end
Take Yeong-ro with you.

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:03.929 line:85.83%,end
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.646 line:85.83%,end
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:15.774 line:85.83%,end
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:20.070 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:23.365 line:85.83%,end
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.951 line:85.83%,end
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:27.744 line:85.83%,end
They might blow themselves up!

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:34.668 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.086 line:85.83%,end
Come on!

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.755 line:85.83%,end
This is crazy!

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.344 line:85.83%,end
No. That's too dangerous.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:47.848 line:85.83%,end
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:50.642 line:85.83%,end
Since Eun is seriously injured,

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.270 line:85.83%,end
Nam must be leading the operation.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.356 line:85.83%,end
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.692 line:85.83%,end
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.195 line:85.83%,end
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.656 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up. Time is running out.

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:24.718 line:85.83%,end
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.304 line:85.83%,end
The first goal of this operation

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:31.475 line:85.83%,end
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:33.935 line:85.83%,end
And the second goal

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.813 line:85.83%,end
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:37.856 line:85.83%,end
If possible,

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.317 line:85.83%,end
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.236 line:85.83%,end
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.030 line:85.83%,end
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:48.909 line:85.83%,end
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:51.370 line:85.83%,end
Those damn brats.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.623 line:85.83%,end
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.125 line:85.83%,end
Everyone wait here.

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.379 line:85.83%,end
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.381 line:85.83%,end
Come on, Ms. Oh.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:06.551 line:85.83%,end
Walk slowly.

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.514 line:85.83%,end
Slowly!

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.849 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:15.060 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:31.410 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.339 line:85.83%,end
If he attacks you again,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.675 line:85.83%,end
don't hesitate to shoot him.

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:51.054 line:85.83%,end
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:55.350 line:85.83%,end
Go up.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.465 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro!

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:41.062 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.320 line:85.83%,end
No! Don't shoot!

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.281 line:85.83%,end
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.366 line:85.83%,end
Get down!

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:57.412 line:85.83%,end
Get out!

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.680 line:85.83%,end
Get out now!
