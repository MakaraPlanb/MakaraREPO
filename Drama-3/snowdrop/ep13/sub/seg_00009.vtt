00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:01.967 line:85.83%,end
Hello, ma'am!

00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:14.271 line:85.83%,end
Give us some privacy.

00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:17.191 line:85.83%,end
Get out, guys.

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:23.489 line:85.83%,end
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.868 line:85.83%,end
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.026 line:85.83%,end
You should really know your place, woman!

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:05.197 line:85.83%,end
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:10.661 line:85.83%,end
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

00:47:10.744 --> 00:47:13.622 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:28.303 line:85.83%,end
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.514 line:85.83%,end
So did you encourage your husband

00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:32.808 line:85.83%,end
to kill my husband?

00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.687 line:85.83%,end
What? Are you out of your mind?

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:39.439 line:85.83%,end
Have you gone insane?

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.482 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:44.528 line:85.83%,end
Since your husband, who's aspiring

00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:48.782 line:85.83%,end
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.742 line:85.83%,end
Get it together

00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:52.536 line:85.83%,end
and go home, please.

00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:02.963 line:85.83%,end
So you're playing innocent?

00:48:03.672 --> 00:48:05.757 line:85.83%,end
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:08.176 line:85.83%,end
everyone around you will be questioned

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.888 line:85.83%,end
and evidence will turn up.

00:48:11.346 --> 00:48:12.723 line:85.83%,end
Will you be okay?

00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:20.772 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my God.

00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:25.152 line:85.83%,end
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

00:48:26.278 --> 00:48:31.867 line:85.83%,end
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.703 line:85.83%,end
And joining in the President's coup,

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:37.164 line:85.83%,end
the First Lady hates you for it.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.503 line:85.83%,end
God, it's come again.

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:46.256 line:85.83%,end
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.551 line:85.83%,end
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:52.638 line:85.83%,end
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.932 line:85.83%,end
You know that, right?

00:48:55.807 --> 00:48:57.267 line:85.83%,end
If she finds out

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.312 line:85.83%,end
my husband was

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.230 line:85.83%,end
in fact shot

00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:05.859 line:85.83%,end
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:08.820 line:85.83%,end
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:13.575 line:85.83%,end
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:15.702 line:85.83%,end
is a philosophy she lives by.

00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.540 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.586 line:85.83%,end
go tell her if you have time for this?

00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:27.214 line:85.83%,end
For Code 1

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:31.593 line:85.83%,end
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:37.557 line:85.83%,end
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.143 line:85.83%,end
That's right! Absolutely!

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:41.311 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

00:49:41.853 --> 00:49:44.481 line:85.83%,end
The election is in seven days now.

00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:48.068 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.987 line:85.83%,end
Those people need me,

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.781 line:85.83%,end
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

00:49:52.864 --> 00:49:55.617 line:85.83%,end
They need me! No matter what I've done!

00:49:58.286 --> 00:49:59.663 line:85.83%,end
Well done!

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.050 line:85.83%,end
Do you think

00:50:12.134 --> 00:50:15.387 line:85.83%,end
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:19.766 line:85.83%,end
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.893 line:85.83%,end
kicked out of a feast.

00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.479 line:85.83%,end
You wench! I'll kill you!

00:50:24.563 --> 00:50:26.231 line:85.83%,end
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:27.232 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am.

00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:28.316 line:85.83%,end
-Let go of me!
-What?

00:50:36.658 --> 00:50:38.744 line:85.83%,end
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:40.579 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.250 line:85.83%,end
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:47.502 line:85.83%,end
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:50.130 line:85.83%,end
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:54.009 line:85.83%,end
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

00:50:54.092 --> 00:50:55.260 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:56.970 line:85.83%,end
Get me out of here. Please!

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:59.306 line:85.83%,end
Of course! Listen.

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:02.142 line:85.83%,end
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.
