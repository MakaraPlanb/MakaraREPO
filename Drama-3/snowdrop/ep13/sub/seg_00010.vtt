There are windows there.

00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:06.354 line:85.83%,end
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:07.689 line:85.83%,end
Okay. Hurry up.

00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:09.024 line:85.83%,end
I'm so scared.

00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:11.860 line:85.83%,end
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:16.031 line:85.83%,end
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:17.199 line:85.83%,end
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.162 line:85.83%,end
Captain!

00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.456 line:85.83%,end
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

00:51:24.539 --> 00:51:25.999 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:32.464 line:85.83%,end
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:35.175 line:85.83%,end
Is someone escaping through the basement?

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.259 line:85.83%,end
Honey!

00:51:37.052 --> 00:51:39.054 line:85.83%,end
I love you!

00:51:39.137 --> 00:51:40.889 line:85.83%,end
Go back home. Now!

00:51:40.972 --> 00:51:42.474 line:85.83%,end
Go now!

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.019 line:85.83%,end
What's gotten into him?

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:49.481 line:85.83%,end
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.905 line:85.83%,end
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

00:52:21.763 --> 00:52:23.223 line:85.83%,end
Stay safe.

00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:32.274 line:85.83%,end
You too.

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:46.788 line:85.83%,end
Good luck.

00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:03.722 line:85.83%,end
Promise me…

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:10.979 line:85.83%,end
you'll leave with me if I come back.

00:53:29.956 --> 00:53:31.416 line:85.83%,end
I guess I must come back

00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.543 line:85.83%,end
to hear your answer.

00:53:58.944 --> 00:54:01.821 line:85.83%,end
Han-na, listen carefully.

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:05.575 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:09.829 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:14.209 line:85.83%,end
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.962 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure they're more than that.

00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:19.965 line:85.83%,end
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

00:54:20.048 --> 00:54:23.301 line:85.83%,end
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:27.430 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:54:27.722 --> 00:54:31.393 line:85.83%,end
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

00:54:33.728 --> 00:54:34.980 line:85.83%,end
And she will soon

00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:40.026 line:85.83%,end
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:43.196 line:85.83%,end
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.409 line:85.83%,end
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.
