00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.814 line:85.83%,end
Abort the mission!

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:03.486 line:85.83%,end
All units, retreat!

00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:05.738 line:85.83%,end
Eight!

00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:09.742 line:85.83%,end
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:11.911 line:85.83%,end
Let go of me!

00:31:11.995 --> 00:31:13.788 line:85.83%,end
I'll make sure to come back!

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:17.333 line:85.83%,end
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:20.503 line:85.83%,end
Retreat!

00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.255 line:85.83%,end
Retreat!

00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:24.841 line:85.83%,end
All units, retreat!

00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:27.135 line:85.83%,end
Sir! Put on your mask!

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.929 line:85.83%,end
Abort the mission! Retreat!

00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:32.432 line:85.83%,end
Abort the mission!

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:35.435 line:85.83%,end
Retreat!

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:12.680 line:85.83%,end
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.849 line:85.83%,end
You coward!

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.935 line:85.83%,end
Why did you do something so stupid?

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:19.979 line:85.83%,end
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:25.068 line:85.83%,end
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:30.198 line:85.83%,end
Quiet!

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:34.285 line:85.83%,end
They've all retreated!

00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:35.870 line:85.83%,end
Go wash up now!

00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:36.913 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:45.713 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.299 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:54.263 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:57.058 line:85.83%,end
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.768 line:85.83%,end
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:01.854 line:85.83%,end
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:05.900 line:85.83%,end
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.238 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Choi.

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:11.656 line:85.83%,end
Yes, ma'am?

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:16.035 line:85.83%,end
Was it really the spies that shot him?

00:33:17.453 --> 00:33:19.872 line:85.83%,end
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:25.503 line:85.83%,end
Isn't this an election scheme?

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.924 line:85.83%,end
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:35.638 line:85.83%,end
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:39.225 line:85.83%,end
It doesn't make sense.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:44.147 line:85.83%,end
Well, that's true.

00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:51.029 line:85.83%,end
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:54.490 line:85.83%,end
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

00:33:57.326 --> 00:34:01.789 line:85.83%,end
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:05.043 line:85.83%,end
But you don't have any doubts about it?

00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:14.177 line:85.83%,end
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.387 line:85.83%,end
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:21.225 line:85.83%,end
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:25.271 line:85.83%,end
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:27.565 line:85.83%,end
<i>The bombs they have</i>

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:30.902 line:85.83%,end
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.820 line:85.83%,end
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.158 line:85.83%,end
The bombs we have are too many?

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:40.161 line:85.83%,end
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.582 line:85.83%,end
How's Mr. Eun?

00:34:44.665 --> 00:34:46.334 line:85.83%,end
They said the surgery went well,

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.586 line:85.83%,end
but he's still unconscious.

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:51.297 line:85.83%,end
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:54.675 line:85.83%,end
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:06.229 line:85.83%,end
Eun is still not conscious.

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:08.773 line:85.83%,end
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:12.235 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

00:35:12.318 --> 00:35:14.320 line:85.83%,end
To make a great contribution

00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:17.615 line:85.83%,end
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:22.995 line:85.83%,end
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:24.956 line:85.83%,end
Seeing how they're lying,

00:35:25.873 --> 00:35:28.668 line:85.83%,end
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:31.629 line:85.83%,end
We must let the press know

00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:34.632 line:85.83%,end
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:37.260 line:85.83%,end
But that's not going to save us.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:43.474 line:85.83%,end
We must cut off their money.

00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:49.814 line:85.83%,end
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:54.944 line:85.83%,end
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?
