00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:44.876 line:85.83%,end
Come on!

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.419 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up! Come on!

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:47.814 line:85.83%,end
It's clear, sir.

00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.286 line:85.83%,end
We'll proceed with the operation.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.371 line:85.83%,end
We're going in.

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:27.646 line:85.83%,end
Room 202, clear.

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:28.730 line:85.83%,end
No targets found.

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:31.399 line:85.83%,end
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:38.823 line:85.83%,end
Forward!

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.133 line:85.83%,end
Don't shoot!

00:28:00.553 --> 00:28:04.224 line:85.83%,end
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.268 line:85.83%,end
Please help.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.896 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.606 line:85.83%,end
Where are you?

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.526 line:85.83%,end
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:29.082 line:85.83%,end
She's there! All units, hold!

00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:32.210 line:85.83%,end
Hold! Stay where you are!

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.549 line:85.83%,end
If you don't stop the operation,

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:40.051 line:85.83%,end
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.515 line:85.83%,end
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:48.143 line:85.83%,end
M1 dynamite

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:50.729 line:85.83%,end
is strapped to her body.

00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:53.773 line:85.83%,end
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.652 line:85.83%,end
we're all going to die here.

00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.572 line:85.83%,end
That goddamn bastard!

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:01.489 line:85.83%,end
One!

00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:04.409 line:85.83%,end
Help!

00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:08.246 line:85.83%,end
-Damn it!
-Two!

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:10.707 line:85.83%,end
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.626 line:85.83%,end
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:22.343 line:85.83%,end
Three!

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.511 line:85.83%,end
Move aside.

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:26.222 line:85.83%,end
Sir! It's dangerous!

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.814 line:85.83%,end
Wait, sir!

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.525 line:85.83%,end
Cheong-ya.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:40.028 line:85.83%,end
Please. Please don't come any closer.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.030 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:09.682 line:85.83%,end
God, it burns.

00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.102 line:85.83%,end
Five!

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:14.354 line:85.83%,end
I'll save you

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:16.689 line:85.83%,end
at all costs.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.901 line:85.83%,end
So hang in-- Damn it!

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.444 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.660 line:85.83%,end
Please…

00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:31.830 line:85.83%,end
Leave now. Please…

00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.207 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.000 line:85.83%,end
Please…

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.342 line:85.83%,end
Seven!
