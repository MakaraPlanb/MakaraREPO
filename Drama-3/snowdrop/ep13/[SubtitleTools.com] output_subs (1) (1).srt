EPISODE 13

3
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,622
I'll go in first.

4
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:26,127
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

5
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,546
We must kill him.

6
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,132
Understood, sir.

7
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:46,439
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

8
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:50,192
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

9
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:53,362
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

10
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:58,326
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

11
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,835
I'm back, sir.

12
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,049
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

13
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:17,470
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

14
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,639
for our country and people.

15
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:22,141
He only cares about saving his daughter.

16
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:24,560
We can't leave our fate to him.

17
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:26,646
If the election scheme succeeds,

18
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:30,107
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

19
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,695
You must climb the ladder

20
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,949
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

21
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:41,577
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

22
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,330
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

23
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:46,791
Good.

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,358
Yeong-ro.

25
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,250
Dad.

26
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,168
Yes?

27
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,299
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

28
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,218
Of course not.

29
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,266
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

30
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,936
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,772
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

32
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:54,942
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

33
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,570
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,783
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,160
No, it's not.

36
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:06,662
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

37
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,790
And my brother…

38
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,127
Yeong-u…

39
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,423
died because of me.

40
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,597
If my friends die too,

41
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:26,515
I won't be able to…

42
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,558
Yeong-ro.

43
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,018
Please…

44
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,314
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

45
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:34,398
Don't move!

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,286
Yeong-ro!

47
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,213
No!

48
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,389
Were you only going to save me?

49
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,269
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?

50
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,022
What? What the hell is she doing?

51
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,441
Yeong-ro.

52
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,028
Your brother asked me to protect you.

53
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:24,240
While drawing his last breath,

54
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:32,123
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

55
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:38,838
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

56
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,092
Can't you understand that?

57
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:52,810
Open fire!

58
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,777
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

59
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,571
Damn it. Follow me.

60
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,239
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

61
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,448
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

62
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:07,825
Hurry up!

63
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,201
-You, with me!
-Wait.

64
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:10,744
What about us?

65
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,123
Come in!

66
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:16,041
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

67
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,001
Move back!

68
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,335
Don't shoot!

69
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,299
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

70
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:25,759
Who the hell is shooting?

71
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,600
Yeong-ro.

72
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,185
Yeong-ro.

73
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:35,978
It's all right.

74
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:37,730
It's okay.

75
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:38,939
You're safe.

76
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,989
Hold fire!

77
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:49,992
Kill him.

78
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,828
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

79
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:10,679
Mr. Eun!

80
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,223
Mr. Eun!

81
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,892
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

82
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,062
Mr. Eun!

83
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,357
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

84
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:23,484
Damn it!

85
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,735
We need a medical team.

86
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,070
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

87
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,404
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

88
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,864
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

89
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:30,157
Move faster!

90
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,058
I was worried
something had happened to you.

91
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,310
I was quite scared.

92
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,646
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

93
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:01,897
We're all going to die?

94
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:03,899
Watch what you say.

95
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,276
Shut your own mouth.

96
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,195
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

97
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,614
and you beg your enemy for your life?

98
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,500
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

99
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,420
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

100
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,676
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

101
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:32,344
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

102
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,431
Eung-cheol.

103
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,312
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

104
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,480
Search the room for lanterns.

105
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,774
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

106
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,444
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

107
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:54,908
By yourself?

108
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,039
Untie me.

109
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:03,250
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

110
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,626
You can't, Comrade Lim.

111
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,172
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

112
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:13,260
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

113
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,804
Understood.

114
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:36,158
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,249
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

116
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:48,045
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

117
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,425
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us all…

118
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,347
Hold on.

119
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:02,017
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

120
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:09,733
The radio.

121
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:11,777
I should find it first.

122
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,033
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

123
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:20,828
How's Eun?

124
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:24,081
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

125
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,082
So?

126
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,876
Is he going to make it or not?

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,088
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

128
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,631
I'm sure he'll make it.

129
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,718
"What happened?"

130
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,847
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

131
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,223
Are you seriously asking?

132
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:43,392
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

133
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,104
and those damn spies got him.

134
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,774
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

135
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:54,903
I mean, last time--

136
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:59,992
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

137
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:02,870
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

138
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,580
You still think he wouldn't do it?

139
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:07,791
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

140
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:16,592
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

141
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,261
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

142
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:20,804
Damn it.

143
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,900
Hello?

144
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,360
Hello, doctor. How are you?

145
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,490
He's been shot?

146
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,492
How is he?

147
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:46,538
You must save him. Please.

148
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,332
Okay. I'll be right over.

149
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,423
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

150
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:00,802
But they shot the ANSP director?

151
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,931
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

152
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:07,559
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

153
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,394
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

154
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:10,896
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

155
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:13,815
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

156
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,319
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

157
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,988
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

158
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,532
What's going on?

159
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,951
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

160
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,662
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

161
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,122
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

162
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,672
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

163
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,383
Until we figure out what's going on,

164
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,302
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

165
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,723
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

166
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,982
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

167
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:03,490
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

168
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,034
My hunch is

169
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:09,997
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

170
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,916
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

171
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,002
If that's true,

172
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,171
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

173
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,970
Go to the prayer room.

174
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,656
Right. To the prayer room…

175
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,075
The prayer room.

176
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,303
No!

177
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,383
It's all right.

178
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,845
No one's going to die.

179
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,557
Don't worry.

180
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,573
I apologize, sir.

181
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,409
I tried so hard to stop him,

182
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,452
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

183
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,579
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

184
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:18,208
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!

185
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,501
That's not true, sir.

186
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,920
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

187
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,214
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

188
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,215
<i>Disobeying?</i>

189
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,595
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

190
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,972
our country's fate?

191
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,642
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

192
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,436
I will, sir!

193
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,147
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

194
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,773
Don't worry a thing, sir!

195
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:43,066
I swear on my life--

196
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:55,495
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

197
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,206
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

198
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,960
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

199
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:06,006
We have the upper hand now.

200
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,049
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:10,177
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

202
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,347
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

203
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,308
Then cut off the power.

204
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:19,311
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

205
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:21,605
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,208
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

207
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:49,925
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

208
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,513
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

209
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,097
Who did such a horrible thing?

210
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:57,641
It must be Nam Tae-il.

211
00:15:58,934 --> 00:15:59,893
Nam Tae-il?

212
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:02,145
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

213
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,566
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

214
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:09,778
Hold on.

215
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:11,780
<i>Well,</i>

216
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:16,368
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

217
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:19,538
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

218
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,498
<i>and we have decided</i>

219
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,166
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

220
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,418
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

221
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:26,962
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

222
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,631
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

223
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:34,094
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

224
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,179
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

225
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,557
They're making up

226
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:42,978
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

227
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,022
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

228
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:47,315
Right?

229
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,817
That's obvious.

230
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,779
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

231
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,908
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

232
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:02,747
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

233
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,332
Then…

234
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,376
will it be tonight?

235
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,461
We should get ready to fight right now.

236
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:14,050
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

237
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,665
To the library?

238
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,084
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

239
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,003
What do we do now?

240
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,297
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

241
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,257
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

242
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,509
Really?

243
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:59,179
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

244
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,015
What?

245
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,142
He was shot?

246
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,102
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

247
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:11,274
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

248
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,485
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

249
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:19,908
Yeong-ro!

250
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,045
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

251
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:36,132
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

252
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,301
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

253
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,887
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

254
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,264
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

255
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:46,685
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

256
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,187
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

257
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,440
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

258
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,526
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

259
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,655
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>

260
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,085
I told you to move in lines!

261
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,296
Move in lines!

262
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:58,631
Move in lines!

263
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,177
Are you okay?

264
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,512
My dad…

265
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,723
How did my dad get shot?

266
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,851
Go stay in the library. Now!

267
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,269
Take Yeong-ro with you.

268
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:12,729
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

269
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,446
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

270
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,574
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

271
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,870
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

272
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:32,165
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

273
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:34,751
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

274
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,544
They might blow themselves up!

275
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,468
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

276
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,886
Come on!

277
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,555
This is crazy!

278
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:53,144
No. That's too dangerous.

279
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:56,648
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

280
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,442
Since Eun is seriously injured,

281
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,070
Nam must be leading the operation.

282
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,156
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

283
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,492
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

284
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:10,995
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

285
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,456
Hurry up. Time is running out.

286
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:33,518
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

287
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,104
The first goal of this operation

288
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,275
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

289
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,735
And the second goal

290
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,613
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

291
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:46,656
If possible,

292
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,117
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

293
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:52,036
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

294
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,830
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

295
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:57,709
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

296
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,170
Those damn brats.

297
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:03,423
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

298
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,925
Everyone wait here.

299
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:09,179
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

300
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:11,181
Come on, Ms. Oh.

301
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:15,351
Walk slowly.

302
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,314
Slowly!

303
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:21,649
Comrade Joo!

304
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,860
Comrade Joo!

305
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:40,210
Eung-cheol.

306
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,139
If he attacks you again,

307
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,475
don't hesitate to shoot him.

308
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,854
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

309
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,150
Go up.

310
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:35,265
Yeong-ro!

311
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:49,862
Hey!

312
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:57,120
No! Don't shoot!

313
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:00,081
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

314
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:02,166
Get down!

315
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:06,212
Get out!

316
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,480
Get out now!

317
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,676
Come on!

318
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,219
Hurry up! Come on!

319
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:56,614
It's clear, sir.

320
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,086
We'll proceed with the operation.

321
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,171
We're going in.

322
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,446
Room 202, clear.

323
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,530
No targets found.

324
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:40,199
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

325
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:47,623
Forward!

326
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:05,933
Don't shoot!

327
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:13,024
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

328
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,068
Please help.

329
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:18,696
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

330
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,406
Where are you?

331
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,326
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

332
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:37,882
She's there! All units, hold!

333
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:41,010
Hold! Stay where you are!

334
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,349
If you don't stop the operation,

335
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,851
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

336
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:54,315
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

337
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:56,943
M1 dynamite

338
00:27:58,069 --> 00:27:59,529
is strapped to her body.

339
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,573
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

340
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,452
we're all going to die here.

341
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:09,372
That goddamn bastard!

342
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,289
One!

343
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:13,209
Help!

344
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,046
-Damn it!
-Two!

345
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,507
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

346
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,426
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

347
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:31,143
Three!

348
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,311
Move aside.

349
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:35,022
Sir! It's dangerous!

350
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:43,614
Wait, sir!

351
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,325
Cheong-ya.

352
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,828
Please. Please don't come any closer.

353
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,830
Please.

354
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,482
God, it burns.

355
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:21,902
Five!

356
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,154
I'll save you

357
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:25,489
at all costs.

358
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,701
So hang in-- Damn it!

359
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:30,244
Sir.

360
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,460
Please…

361
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,630
Leave now. Please…

362
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:43,007
Sir.

363
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,800
Please…

364
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:53,142
Seven!

365
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:06,614
Abort the mission!

366
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:12,286
All units, retreat!

367
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:14,538
Eight!

368
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:18,542
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

369
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:20,711
Let go of me!

370
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:22,588
I'll make sure to come back!

371
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:26,133
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

372
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:29,303
Retreat!

373
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,055
Retreat!

374
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,641
All units, retreat!

375
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,935
Sir! Put on your mask!

376
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:38,729
Abort the mission! Retreat!

377
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:41,232
Abort the mission!

378
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,235
Retreat!

379
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:21,480
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

380
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,649
You coward!

381
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,735
Why did you do something so stupid?

382
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,779
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

383
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:33,868
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

384
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,998
Quiet!

385
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,085
They've all retreated!

386
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,670
Go wash up now!

387
00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:45,713
Hurry up!

388
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:54,513
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

389
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,099
Okay.

390
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:03,063
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

391
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,858
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

392
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,568
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

393
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:10,654
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

394
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:14,700
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

395
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,038
Mr. Choi.

396
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:20,456
Yes, ma'am?

397
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,835
Was it really the spies that shot him?

398
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:28,672
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

399
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:34,303
Isn't this an election scheme?

400
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,724
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

401
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:44,438
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

402
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,025
It doesn't make sense.

403
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,947
Well, that's true.

404
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,829
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

405
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:03,290
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

406
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:10,589
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

407
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:13,843
But you don't have any doubts about it?

408
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,977
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

409
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,187
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

410
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:30,025
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

411
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:34,071
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

412
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,365
<i>The bombs they have</i>

413
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,702
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

414
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,620
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

415
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,958
The bombs we have are too many?

416
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,961
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

417
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,382
How's Mr. Eun?

418
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,134
They said the surgery went well,

419
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:57,386
but he's still unconscious.

420
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,097
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

421
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,475
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

422
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,029
Eun is still not conscious.

423
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,573
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

424
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:21,035
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

425
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:23,120
To make a great contribution

426
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,415
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

427
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:31,795
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

428
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,756
Seeing how they're lying,

429
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:37,468
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

430
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,429
We must let the press know

431
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:43,432
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

432
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,060
But that's not going to save us.

433
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,274
We must cut off their money.

434
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:58,614
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

435
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,744
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?

436
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:11,293
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of money…

437
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:14,755
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

438
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,590
who wants us dead.

439
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,176
That's right.

440
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:23,389
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

441
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,182
But how on earth

442
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,893
will we cut off the money?

443
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,983
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

444
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:41,281
Look, doctor.

445
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:46,161
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

446
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:51,291
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

447
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,793
And you'll take it from him?

448
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,672
As you all know,

449
00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:01,552
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

450
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:07,141
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

451
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:13,188
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

452
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,857
and how it's managed.

453
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:21,196
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

454
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:26,910
But will it be enough to make it work?

455
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,247
An's wife is quite easy to handle

456
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,500
because she's very greedy.

457
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,711
And she has a head for managing money,

458
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,839
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

459
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,592
That's true. An made quite big money

460
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:44,511
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

461
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,473
I heard him boasting about it.

462
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:54,730
I'll go out and intercept the money.

463
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:58,317
As long as the money is our possession,

464
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,778
they can never set off the bombs.

465
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:05,908
Can I have a word?

466
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:18,837
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

467
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,007
Can't you see what she's up to?

468
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,009
She wants to get out of here.

469
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:28,097
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

470
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:32,142
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

471
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:37,106
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

472
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:40,609
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

473
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,529
Fine.

474
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,951
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

475
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:53,789
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

476
00:37:56,625 --> 00:38:00,337
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

477
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:05,300
All right, fine.

478
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:08,595
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

479
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,681
that large amount of money.

480
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:13,058
She's coming back here with it?

481
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:14,977
Do you believe that?

482
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,396
Or are you pretending to?

483
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,359
Whichever the case,

484
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,571
do you have any other plan?

485
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:26,864
As soon as she gets out--

486
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:30,325
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

487
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,664
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

488
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:38,709
How?

489
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,836
How will you?

490
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,382
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

491
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:48,719
who got Eun shot right now.

492
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,097
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

493
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:54,057
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

494
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:00,439
As you say,

495
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,860
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

496
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,906
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

497
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:13,118
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

498
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,414
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

499
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,752
So we have

500
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:24,671
a 50-50 chance?

501
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:32,304
Fine.

502
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,059
Han-na.

503
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:38,810
Han-na, do you copy?

504
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,022
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

505
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:45,234
VIP WARD

506
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:04,127
Excuse me.

507
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:05,879
How can I get to the VIP ward?

508
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:08,548
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?

509
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:10,133
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

510
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:12,344
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

511
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,179
Doctor.

512
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:18,392
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

513
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,103
Of course. Don't worry too much.

514
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:25,774
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

515
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,317
She asked for it.

516
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,986
Sure.

517
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:33,740
She said I did?

518
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:34,866
Yes.

519
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:49,214
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

520
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,509
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

521
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:23,999
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,211
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

523
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,383
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

524
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:37,471
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

525
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,474
I'll distract them

526
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:43,602
to help you come back in safely.

527
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:48,565
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

528
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,943
And now you're making sure I come back?

529
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:54,154
To be honest,

530
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:57,074
I still hope

531
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,993
you'll stop being used like me…

532
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:04,164
and leave for another country

533
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:07,959
to live a happy life.

534
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:14,966
But you need to come back

535
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:18,011
for the hostages,

536
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:20,180
my comrades,

537
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:24,476
and my sister Su-hui to live.

538
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:29,064
Are you

539
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:32,109
scared that I might…

540
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,115
not come back?

541
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:46,915
Then give me…

542
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:52,003
a reason I must

543
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,424
come back.

544
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,262
For instance,

545
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,809
"If you come back with the money,

546
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:15,152
I will leave with you to another country."

547
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,533
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

548
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,581
But if I can leave with you…

549
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:46,766
Eun's wife is already moving.

550
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:52,814
You should get ready.

551
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:07,787
Think carefully.

552
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:10,957
This is

553
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,712
the only way you'll live.

554
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,174
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

555
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,051
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

556
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:22,093
-Salute!
-Salute!

557
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:23,303
Understand, you bastard?

558
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:24,638
-Ma'am!
-What?

559
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:35,273
What are you doing here?

560
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:37,442
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

561
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:44,241
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

562
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,451
She practically threatened me

563
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:48,954
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

564
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:52,165
What? Eun's wife really did that?

565
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:53,291
-Salute!
-Salute!

566
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,126
Mr. Nam.

567
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:10,767
Hello, ma'am!

568
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:23,071
Give us some privacy.

569
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:25,991
Get out, guys.

570
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,289
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

571
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,668
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

572
00:46:07,282 --> 00:46:09,826
You should really know your place, woman!

573
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,997
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

574
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:19,461
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

575
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:22,422
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

576
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:37,103
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

577
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:39,314
So did you encourage your husband

578
00:46:39,939 --> 00:46:41,608
to kill my husband?

579
00:46:43,193 --> 00:46:45,487
What? Are you out of your mind?

580
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:48,239
Have you gone insane?

581
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:49,282
My goodness.

582
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:53,328
Since your husband, who's aspiring

583
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:57,582
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

584
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,542
Get it together

585
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:01,336
and go home, please.

586
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:11,763
So you're playing innocent?

587
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:14,557
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

588
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,976
everyone around you will be questioned

589
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,688
and evidence will turn up.

590
00:47:20,146 --> 00:47:21,523
Will you be okay?

591
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:29,572
Oh, my God.

592
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:33,952
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

593
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:40,667
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

594
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,503
And joining in the President's coup,

595
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,964
the First Lady hates you for it.

596
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,303
God, it's come again.

597
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:55,056
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

598
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,351
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

599
00:47:58,935 --> 00:48:01,438
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

600
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:03,732
You know that, right?

601
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,067
If she finds out

602
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,112
my husband was

603
00:48:09,738 --> 00:48:11,030
in fact shot

604
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:14,659
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

605
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:17,620
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

606
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:22,375
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

607
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:24,502
is a philosophy she lives by.

608
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:29,340
Why don't you

609
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,386
go tell her if you have time for this?

610
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:36,014
For Code 1

611
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:40,393
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

612
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:46,357
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

613
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,943
That's right! Absolutely!

614
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,111
Of course.

615
00:48:50,653 --> 00:48:53,281
The election is in seven days now.

616
00:48:54,073 --> 00:48:56,868
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

617
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:58,787
Those people need me,

618
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,581
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

619
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:04,417
They need me! No matter what I've done!

620
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:08,463
Well done!

621
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:20,850
Do you think

622
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:24,187
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

623
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:28,566
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

624
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,693
kicked out of a feast.

625
00:49:31,194 --> 00:49:33,279
You wench! I'll kill you!

626
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:35,031
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

627
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:36,032
Ma'am.

628
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:37,116
-Let go of me!
-What?

629
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,544
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

630
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:49,379
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

631
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,050
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

632
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,302
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

633
00:49:56,386 --> 00:49:58,930
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

634
00:49:59,013 --> 00:50:02,809
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

635
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:04,060
<i>What do I do?</i>

636
00:50:04,143 --> 00:50:05,770
Get me out of here. Please!

637
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:08,106
Of course! Listen.

638
00:50:08,189 --> 00:50:10,942
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.

639
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:12,151
There are windows there.

640
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:15,154
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

641
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,489
Okay. Hurry up.

642
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:17,824
I'm so scared.

643
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:20,660
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

644
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:24,831
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

645
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:25,999
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

646
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:30,962
Captain!

647
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:33,256
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

648
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:34,799
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

649
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:41,264
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

650
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,975
Is someone escaping through the basement?

651
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:45,059
Honey!

652
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:47,854
I love you!

653
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,689
Go back home. Now!

654
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:51,274
Go now!

655
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,819
What's gotten into him?

656
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:58,281
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

657
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:05,705
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

658
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:32,023
Stay safe.

659
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:41,074
You too.

660
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,588
Good luck.

661
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:12,522
Promise me…

662
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:19,779
you'll leave with me if I come back.

663
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,216
I guess I must come back

664
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:42,343
to hear your answer.

665
00:53:07,744 --> 00:53:10,621
Han-na, listen carefully.

666
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:14,375
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

667
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:18,629
What?

668
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:23,009
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

669
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:25,762
I'm sure they're more than that.

670
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:28,765
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

671
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:32,101
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

672
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:36,230
Okay.

673
00:53:36,522 --> 00:53:40,193
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

674
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:43,780
And she will soon

675
00:53:44,947 --> 00:53:48,826
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

676
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,996
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

677
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,209
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.

678
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:53,159
-Careful.
-Damn it.

679
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:56,078
Turn on the lights. There.

680
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:00,124
You're home!

681
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,127
I'm so relieved.

682
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:06,214
I'm not dreaming, am I?

683
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:10,760
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

684
00:56:15,014 --> 00:56:16,015
That hurts so much.

685
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:20,394
Do you know how much I resented you?

686
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:22,772
I know I told you to leave,

687
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:25,775
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

688
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:28,027
What do you mean, run?

689
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,946
I was scared they might blow you up.

690
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:33,783
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

691
00:56:33,866 --> 00:56:36,494
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

692
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:38,746
I chose to retreat to save you.

693
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,874
God, do you know how sad I was?

694
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,210
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

695
00:56:44,293 --> 00:56:46,462
So I decided to escape at all costs.

696
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:50,049
You did well. I've been thinking

697
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:53,678
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

698
00:56:54,387 --> 00:56:58,015
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

699
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,310
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

700
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:02,853
and shooting the ANSP director.

701
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:05,398
Those damn bastards.

702
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:09,068
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

703
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:12,363
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

704
00:57:12,446 --> 00:57:15,366
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

705
00:57:16,158 --> 00:57:17,660
It must've been hard for you.

706
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:19,245
You did well.

707
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:23,624
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

708
00:57:24,834 --> 00:57:28,212
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

709
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,964
Let's go.

710
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:54,989
Dad…

711
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:10,171
Dad…

712
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:30,858
Please… Dad…

713
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:07,103
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

714
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:08,729
Help the less fortunate.

715
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:12,024
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

716
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:16,195
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

717
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,989
We still have as many as six days left.

718
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:23,577
You're number two in the ANSP now.

719
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,831
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

720
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:30,918
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

721
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:32,503
A scam?

722
00:59:32,586 --> 00:59:35,464
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

723
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:40,803
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

724
00:59:40,886 --> 00:59:42,054
With that much money,

725
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:46,142
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

726
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:49,854
-A hundred?
-Yes!

727
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:52,398
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

728
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:55,693
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

729
00:59:58,529 --> 00:59:59,655
The President?

730
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:07,621
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

731
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:11,625
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

732
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:15,129
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

733
01:00:22,678 --> 01:00:23,888
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

734
01:00:23,971 --> 01:00:25,473
Those bastards

735
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:27,433
even strapped bombs

736
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:29,977
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

737
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,354
Will you keep letting me down?

738
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:38,068
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

739
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,570
I apologize.

740
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,616
But the truth is, because Director Eun

741
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:45,743
failed to keep his man under control,

742
01:00:45,826 --> 01:00:48,621
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

743
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:52,833
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.

744
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:03,844
The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

745
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:07,973
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

746
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:12,770
If you say yes,

747
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:15,356
I will put an end to it at once.

748
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:35,834
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

749
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,588
I really appreciate it, sir!

750
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:16,417
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

751
01:02:47,323 --> 01:02:48,616
How on earth…

752
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:51,076
Weren't you

753
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:54,538
being held hostage in the dorm?

754
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:03,631
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

755
01:03:22,524 --> 01:03:23,651
Mother…

756
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:28,197
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

757
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,740
once again before she dies.

758
01:03:33,035 --> 01:03:36,121
What do you need me to do?

759
01:03:53,138 --> 01:03:54,765
They're all useless.

760
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,768
But I've picked out just a few

761
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:01,438
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

762
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:08,821
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

763
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,575
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

764
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:15,661
so you should never miss them.

765
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:17,705
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

766
01:04:20,749 --> 01:04:22,626
"So precious," you say?

767
01:04:23,085 --> 01:04:25,713
That person will change your life

768
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:27,464
completely.

769
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:48,193
Ms. Kim!

770
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:50,654
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

771
01:04:52,114 --> 01:04:56,869
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

772
01:04:56,952 --> 01:04:58,912
I guess so.

773
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:02,124
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

774
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,084
Yes. She's getting changed.

775
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:06,712
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

776
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,047
Oh, is that so?

777
01:05:20,976 --> 01:05:22,060
She's a foreigner.

778
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:35,240
Oh, my.

779
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,707
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

780
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:46,460
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.

781
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,122
She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

782
01:06:24,206 --> 01:06:25,833
for a private equity fund that she made.

783
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:28,293
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

784
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:30,796
I'm sure it is.

785
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:40,514
So only one spot's left?

786
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:54,695
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

787
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:55,904
Oh, my.

788
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:59,908
My goodness. Thank you so much.

789
01:06:59,992 --> 01:07:02,703
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

790
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:14,673
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

791
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,302
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

792
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:21,638
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

793
01:07:21,722 --> 01:07:24,349
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

794
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,518
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

795
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:11,313
I did everything you told me to do.

796
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:15,400
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

797
01:08:16,276 --> 01:08:17,778
Nam Tae-il…

798
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,656
must not find out.

799
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:22,491
Of course.

800
01:08:22,574 --> 01:08:26,161
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

801
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:30,916
You were very lucky.

802
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,543
He said only 13 people would die…

803
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:39,007
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

804
01:08:39,675 --> 01:08:42,302
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

805
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:44,805
just graze your ribs a little?

806
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,307
The deity kept you safe.

807
01:08:49,267 --> 01:08:50,310
Now…

808
01:08:53,355 --> 01:08:57,442
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

809
01:09:06,076 --> 01:09:08,286
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

810
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,038
Keep up the good work.

811
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:12,499
I've got to say,

812
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,711
she's a good luck charm.

813
01:09:15,794 --> 01:09:18,463
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

814
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:20,298
Wait.

815
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:24,177
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

816
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:29,391
My God.

817
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,144
Hello?

818
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,021
Hello?

819
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:40,027
Just when I was about to call you!

820
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,572
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

821
01:09:43,655 --> 01:09:46,241
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

822
01:09:46,324 --> 01:09:49,286
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

823
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,288
How about the Maldives?

824
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:54,666
You precious little fox.

825
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,668
Sure.

826
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:59,087
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

827
01:09:59,171 --> 01:10:01,339
Really? You really mean it?

828
01:10:02,424 --> 01:10:04,176
Tell me your passport number then.

829
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:06,511
Okay.

830
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,767
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

831
01:10:13,351 --> 01:10:15,562
I know. Me too.

832
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:27,365
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

833
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:31,078
I'd like to open a secret account.

834
01:10:32,537 --> 01:10:35,916
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

835
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:38,627
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

836
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,924
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

837
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:47,427
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

838
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:53,266
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

839
01:10:53,934 --> 01:10:55,060
Arrest her?

840
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:57,687
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

841
01:10:59,773 --> 01:11:01,983
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

842
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:03,819
Who said anything about the agency?

843
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:07,739
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

844
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:10,742
That's the only way to save the hostages

845
01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:13,995
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

846
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:40,105
<i>I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't</i>

847
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:42,232
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

848
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:44,067
So trust me and be patient.

849
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,819
<i>That's great!</i>

850
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,904
Them blowing themselves up?
That's way better.

851
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:50,532
<i>What if Kang makes off
with 300 million dollars?</i>

852
01:11:50,615 --> 01:11:52,742
<i>Just trust her and wait for her?</i>

853
01:11:52,826 --> 01:11:54,244
<i>Once she has that much money,</i>

854
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:56,329
<i>she might flee to another country.</i>

855
01:11:58,165 --> 01:12:00,667
<i>I'll help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.</i>

856
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:06,798
Your father is the ANSP director?

857
01:12:06,882 --> 01:12:09,301
<i>Isn't he the one trying to kill us all?</i>

858
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:11,344
<i>Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?</i>

859
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:13,305
<i>That's so creepy!</i>

860
01:12:13,388 --> 01:12:16,474
I want to help you get out alive.

861
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:19,269
<i>I'll get in the same car as Soo-ho.</i>

862
01:12:19,895 --> 01:12:21,313
<i>I'm sorry I've put you</i>

863
01:12:22,647 --> 01:12:23,899
<i>through all this.</i>

864
01:12:25,525 --> 01:12:26,776
<i>Soo-ho.</i>

865
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:30,405
I'll stay by your side until the end.

866
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:37,245
BONUS

867
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:44,794
You're Linda Young, a fund manager
at ABK Partners based in Hong Kong.

868
01:12:45,337 --> 01:12:47,464
And you're flying to the New York HQ
tomorrow morning

869
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:49,341
to have a conference meeting.

870
01:12:49,424 --> 01:12:51,593
I'm Gong Gil-sun,

871
01:12:51,676 --> 01:12:54,679
who used to scam US soldiers in Osaka.

872
01:12:54,763 --> 01:12:57,724
I'm the Gong Gil-sun.
Don't you know my nickname?

873
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,143
Of course I do. "Threatening Gong."
