EPISODE 13

3
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,822
I'll go in first.

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,327
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,746
We must kill him.

6
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,332
Understood, sir.

7
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,639
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

8
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,392
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,562
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

10
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,526
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

11
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,035
I'm back, sir.

12
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,249
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

13
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,670
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

14
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,839
for our country and people.

15
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,341
He only cares about saving his daughter.

16
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,760
We can't leave our fate to him.

17
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,846
If the election scheme succeeds,

18
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,307
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

19
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,895
You must climb the ladder

20
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,149
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

21
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,777
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,530
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

23
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,991
Good.

24
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,558
Yeong-ro.

25
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,450
Dad.

26
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,368
Yes?

27
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,499
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

28
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,418
Of course not.

29
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,466
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,136
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

31
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,972
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

32
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,142
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

33
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,770
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,983
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,360
No, it's not.

36
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,862
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

37
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,990
And my brother…

38
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,327
Yeong-u…

39
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,623
died because of me.

40
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,797
If my friends die too,

41
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,715
I won't be able to…

42
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,758
Yeong-ro.

43
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,218
Please…

44
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,514
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

45
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
Don't move!

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,486
Yeong-ro!

47
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,413
No!

48
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,589
Were you only going to save me?

49
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,469
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?

50
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,222
What? What the hell is she doing?

51
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,641
Yeong-ro.

52
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,228
Your brother asked me to protect you.

53
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,440
While drawing his last breath,

54
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,323
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

55
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,038
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

56
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,292
Can't you understand that?

57
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,010
Open fire!

58
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,977
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

59
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,771
Damn it. Follow me.

60
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,439
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

61
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,648
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

62
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,025
Hurry up!

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,401
-You, with me!
-Wait.

64
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,944
What about us?

65
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,323
Come in!

66
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,241
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

67
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,201
Move back!

68
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,535
Don't shoot!

69
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,499
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,959
Who the hell is shooting?

71
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeong-ro.

72
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,385
Yeong-ro.

73
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
It's all right.

74
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
It's okay.

75
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,139
You're safe.

76
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,189
Hold fire!

77
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,192
Kill him.

78
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,028
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

79
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,879
Mr. Eun!

80
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,423
Mr. Eun!

81
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,092
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

82
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,262
Mr. Eun!

83
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

84
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,684
Damn it!

85
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,935
We need a medical team.

86
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,270
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

87
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,604
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,064
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

89
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,357
Move faster!

90
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,258
I was worried
something had happened to you.

91
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,510
I was quite scared.

92
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,846
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

93
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,097
We're all going to die?

94
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,099
Watch what you say.

95
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,476
Shut your own mouth.

96
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,395
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

97
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,814
and you beg your enemy for your life?

98
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,700
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

99
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,620
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

100
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,876
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

101
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,544
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

102
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,631
Eung-cheol.

103
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,512
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

104
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,680
Search the room for lanterns.

105
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,974
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

106
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,644
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

107
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,108
By yourself?

108
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,239
Untie me.

109
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,450
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

110
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,826
You can't, Comrade Lim.

111
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,372
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

112
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,460
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

113
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,004
Understood.

114
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,358
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,449
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

116
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,245
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

117
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,625
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us all…

118
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,547
Hold on.

119
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,217
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

120
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,933
The radio.

121
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,977
I should find it first.

122
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,233
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

123
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,028
How's Eun?

124
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,281
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

125
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,282
So?

126
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,076
Is he going to make it or not?

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,288
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

128
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
I'm sure he'll make it.

129
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,918
"What happened?"

130
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,047
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

131
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,423
Are you seriously asking?

132
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,592
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

133
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,304
and those damn spies got him.

134
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,974
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

135
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,103
I mean, last time--

136
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,192
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

137
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,070
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
You still think he wouldn't do it?

139
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,991
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

140
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,792
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

141
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,461
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

142
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,004
Damn it.

143
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,100
Hello?

144
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,560
Hello, doctor. How are you?

145
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,690
He's been shot?

146
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,692
How is he?

147
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,738
You must save him. Please.

148
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,532
Okay. I'll be right over.

149
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,623
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

150
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,002
But they shot the ANSP director?

151
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

152
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,759
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

153
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,594
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

154
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,096
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

155
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,015
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

156
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,519
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

157
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,188
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

158
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,732
What's going on?

159
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,151
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

160
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,862
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

161
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,322
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

162
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,872
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

163
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,583
Until we figure out what's going on,

164
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,502
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

165
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,923
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

166
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,182
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

167
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,690
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

168
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,234
My hunch is

169
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,197
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

170
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,116
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

171
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,202
If that's true,

172
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,371
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

173
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,170
Go to the prayer room.

174
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,856
Right. To the prayer room…

175
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,275
The prayer room.

176
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,503
No!

177
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,583
It's all right.

178
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,045
No one's going to die.

179
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,757
Don't worry.

180
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,773
I apologize, sir.

181
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,609
I tried so hard to stop him,

182
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,652
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

183
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,779
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

184
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,408
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!

185
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,701
That's not true, sir.

186
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,120
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

187
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,414
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

188
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,415
<i>Disobeying?</i>

189
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,795
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

190
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,172
our country's fate?

191
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,842
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

192
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,636
I will, sir!

193
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,347
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

194
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,973
Don't worry a thing, sir!

195
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,266
I swear on my life--

196
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,695
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

197
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,406
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

198
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,160
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

199
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,206
We have the upper hand now.

200
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,249
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,377
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

202
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,547
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

203
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,508
Then cut off the power.

204
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,511
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

205
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,805
Yes, sir.

206
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,408
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

207
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,125
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

208
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,713
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

209
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,297
Who did such a horrible thing?

210
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,841
It must be Nam Tae-il.

211
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,093
Nam Tae-il?

212
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,345
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

213
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,766
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

214
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,978
Hold on.

215
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,980
<i>Well,</i>

216
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

217
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,738
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

218
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>and we have decided</i>

219
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,366
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

220
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,618
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

221
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

222
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,831
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

223
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,294
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

224
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

225
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,757
They're making up

226
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,178
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

227
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,222
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

228
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,515
Right?

229
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,017
That's obvious.

230
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,979
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,108
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

232
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,947
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

233
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,532
Then…

234
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,576
will it be tonight?

235
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,661
We should get ready to fight right now.

236
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,250
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

237
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,865
To the library?

238
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,284
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

239
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,203
What do we do now?

240
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,497
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

241
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,457
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

242
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,709
Really?

243
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,379
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

244
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,215
What?

245
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,342
He was shot?

246
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,302
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

247
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,474
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

248
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,685
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

249
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,108
Yeong-ro!

250
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,245
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

251
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,332
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

252
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,501
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

253
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,087
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

254
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,464
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

255
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,885
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

256
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,387
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

257
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,640
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

258
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,726
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

259
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>

260
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,285
I told you to move in lines!

261
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,496
Move in lines!

262
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,831
Move in lines!

263
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,377
Are you okay?

264
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,712
My dad…

265
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,923
How did my dad get shot?

266
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,051
Go stay in the library. Now!

267
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,469
Take Yeong-ro with you.

268
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,929
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

269
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,646
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

270
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,774
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

271
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:20,070
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

272
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,365
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

273
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,951
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

274
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,744
They might blow themselves up!

275
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,668
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

276
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,086
Come on!

277
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,755
This is crazy!

278
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,344
No. That's too dangerous.

279
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,848
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

280
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,642
Since Eun is seriously injured,

281
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,270
Nam must be leading the operation.

282
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,356
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

283
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,692
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

284
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,195
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

285
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,656
Hurry up. Time is running out.

286
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,718
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

287
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,304
The first goal of this operation

288
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,475
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

289
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,935
And the second goal

290
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,813
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

291
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,856
If possible,

292
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,317
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

293
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,236
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

294
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,030
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

295
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,909
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

296
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,370
Those damn brats.

297
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,623
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

298
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,125
Everyone wait here.

299
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,379
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

300
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,381
Come on, Ms. Oh.

301
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,551
Walk slowly.

302
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,514
Slowly!

303
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,849
Comrade Joo!

304
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,060
Comrade Joo!

305
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,410
Eung-cheol.

306
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,339
If he attacks you again,

307
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,675
don't hesitate to shoot him.

308
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:51,054
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

309
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,350
Go up.

310
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,465
Yeong-ro!

311
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,062
Hey!

312
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,320
No! Don't shoot!

313
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,281
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

314
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,366
Get down!

315
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,412
Get out!

316
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,680
Get out now!

317
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,876
Come on!

318
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,419
Hurry up! Come on!

319
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,814
It's clear, sir.

320
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,286
We'll proceed with the operation.

321
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,371
We're going in.

322
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,646
Room 202, clear.

323
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,730
No targets found.

324
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

325
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,823
Forward!

326
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,133
Don't shoot!

327
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,224
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

328
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,268
Please help.

329
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,896
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

330
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
Where are you?

331
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,526
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

332
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,082
She's there! All units, hold!

333
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,210
Hold! Stay where you are!

334
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,549
If you don't stop the operation,

335
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,051
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

336
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,515
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

337
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,143
M1 dynamite

338
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,729
is strapped to her body.

339
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,773
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

340
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,652
we're all going to die here.

341
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,572
That goddamn bastard!

342
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,489
One!

343
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,409
Help!

344
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,246
-Damn it!
-Two!

345
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,707
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

346
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,626
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

347
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,343
Three!

348
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,511
Move aside.

349
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,222
Sir! It's dangerous!

350
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,814
Wait, sir!

351
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,525
Cheong-ya.

352
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,028
Please. Please don't come any closer.

353
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
Please.

354
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,682
God, it burns.

355
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,102
Five!

356
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,354
I'll save you

357
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,689
at all costs.

358
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,901
So hang in-- Damn it!

359
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,444
Sir.

360
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,660
Please…

361
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,830
Leave now. Please…

362
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,207
Sir.

363
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,000
Please…

364
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,342
Seven!

365
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,814
Abort the mission!

366
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,486
All units, retreat!

367
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,738
Eight!

368
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,742
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

369
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,911
Let go of me!

370
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,788
I'll make sure to come back!

371
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,333
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

372
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,503
Retreat!

373
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,255
Retreat!

374
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,841
All units, retreat!

375
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,135
Sir! Put on your mask!

376
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,929
Abort the mission! Retreat!

377
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,432
Abort the mission!

378
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,435
Retreat!

379
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,680
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

380
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,849
You coward!

381
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,935
Why did you do something so stupid?

382
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,979
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

383
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:25,068
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

384
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,198
Quiet!

385
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,285
They've all retreated!

386
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,870
Go wash up now!

387
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,913
Hurry up!

388
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,713
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

389
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,299
Okay.

390
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:54,263
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

391
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,058
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

392
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,768
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

393
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,854
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

394
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,900
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

395
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,238
Mr. Choi.

396
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,656
Yes, ma'am?

397
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,035
Was it really the spies that shot him?

398
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,872
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

399
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,503
Isn't this an election scheme?

400
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,924
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

401
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:35,638
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

402
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,225
It doesn't make sense.

403
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,147
Well, that's true.

404
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,029
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

405
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,490
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

406
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:01,789
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

407
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,043
But you don't have any doubts about it?

408
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,177
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

409
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,387
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

410
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:21,225
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

411
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,271
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

412
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,565
<i>The bombs they have</i>

413
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,902
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

414
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,820
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

415
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,158
The bombs we have are too many?

416
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,161
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

417
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,582
How's Mr. Eun?

418
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,334
They said the surgery went well,

419
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
but he's still unconscious.

420
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,297
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

421
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,675
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

422
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,229
Eun is still not conscious.

423
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,773
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

424
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,235
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

425
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,320
To make a great contribution

426
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,615
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

427
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,995
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

428
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,956
Seeing how they're lying,

429
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,668
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

430
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,629
We must let the press know

431
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,632
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

432
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,260
But that's not going to save us.

433
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,474
We must cut off their money.

434
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,814
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

435
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,944
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?

436
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,493
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of money…

437
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,955
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

438
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,790
who wants us dead.

439
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,376
That's right.

440
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,589
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

441
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,382
But how on earth

442
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,093
will we cut off the money?

443
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,183
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

444
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,481
Look, doctor.

445
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,361
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

446
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,491
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

447
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,993
And you'll take it from him?

448
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,872
As you all know,

449
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,752
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

450
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,341
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

451
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:04,388
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

452
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,057
and how it's managed.

453
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,396
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

454
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,110
But will it be enough to make it work?

455
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,447
An's wife is quite easy to handle

456
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,700
because she's very greedy.

457
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,911
And she has a head for managing money,

458
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,039
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

459
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,792
That's true. An made quite big money

460
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,711
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

461
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,673
I heard him boasting about it.

462
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,930
I'll go out and intercept the money.

463
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,517
As long as the money is our possession,

464
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,978
they can never set off the bombs.

465
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,108
Can I have a word?

466
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,037
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

467
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,207
Can't you see what she's up to?

468
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,209
She wants to get out of here.

469
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,297
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

470
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,342
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

471
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,306
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

472
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,809
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

473
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,729
Fine.

474
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,151
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

475
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,989
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

476
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,537
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

477
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,500
All right, fine.

478
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,795
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

479
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,881
that large amount of money.

480
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,258
She's coming back here with it?

481
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,177
Do you believe that?

482
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,596
Or are you pretending to?

483
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,559
Whichever the case,

484
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,771
do you have any other plan?

485
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,064
As soon as she gets out--

486
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,525
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

487
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,864
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

488
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,909
How?

489
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,036
How will you?

490
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,582
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

491
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,919
who got Eun shot right now.

492
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,297
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

493
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,257
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

494
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,639
As you say,

495
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,060
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

496
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,106
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

497
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,318
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

498
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,614
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

499
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,952
So we have

500
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,871
a 50-50 chance?

501
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,504
Fine.

502
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,259
Han-na.

503
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,010
Han-na, do you copy?

504
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,222
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

505
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,434
VIP WARD

506
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,327
Excuse me.

507
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,079
How can I get to the VIP ward?

508
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,748
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?

509
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,333
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

510
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,544
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

511
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,379
Doctor.

512
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,592
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

513
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,303
Of course. Don't worry too much.

514
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,974
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

515
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,517
She asked for it.

516
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,186
Sure.

517
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,940
She said I did?

518
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,066
Yes.

519
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,414
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

520
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,709
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

521
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,199
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,411
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

523
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,583
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

524
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,671
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

525
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,674
I'll distract them

526
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,802
to help you come back in safely.

527
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,765
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

528
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,143
And now you're making sure I come back?

529
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,354
To be honest,

530
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,274
I still hope

531
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,193
you'll stop being used like me…

532
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,364
and leave for another country

533
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,159
to live a happy life.

534
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,166
But you need to come back

535
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,211
for the hostages,

536
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,380
my comrades,

537
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,676
and my sister Su-hui to live.

538
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,264
Are you

539
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,309
scared that I might…

540
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,315
not come back?

541
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,115
Then give me…

542
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,203
a reason I must

543
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,624
come back.

544
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,462
For instance,

545
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,009
"If you come back with the money,

546
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:06,352
I will leave with you to another country."

547
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,733
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

548
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,781
But if I can leave with you…

549
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,966
Eun's wife is already moving.

550
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,014
You should get ready.

551
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,987
Think carefully.

552
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,157
This is

553
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,912
the only way you'll live.

554
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,374
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

555
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,251
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

556
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,293
-Salute!
-Salute!

557
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,503
Understand, you bastard?

558
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,838
-Ma'am!
-What?

559
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,473
What are you doing here?

560
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,642
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

561
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:35,441
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

562
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,651
She practically threatened me

563
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,154
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

564
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,365
What? Eun's wife really did that?

565
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,491
-Salute!
-Salute!

566
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,326
Mr. Nam.

567
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,967
Hello, ma'am!

568
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,271
Give us some privacy.

569
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,191
Get out, guys.

570
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,489
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

571
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,868
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

572
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,026
You should really know your place, woman!

573
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:05,197
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

574
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,661
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

575
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,622
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

576
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,303
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

577
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,514
So did you encourage your husband

578
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,808
to kill my husband?

579
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,687
What? Are you out of your mind?

580
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,439
Have you gone insane?

581
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,482
My goodness.

582
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,528
Since your husband, who's aspiring

583
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,782
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

584
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,742
Get it together

585
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,536
and go home, please.

586
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,963
So you're playing innocent?

587
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,757
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

588
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,176
everyone around you will be questioned

589
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,888
and evidence will turn up.

590
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,723
Will you be okay?

591
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,772
Oh, my God.

592
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:25,152
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

593
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:31,867
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

594
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,703
And joining in the President's coup,

595
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,164
the First Lady hates you for it.

596
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,503
God, it's come again.

597
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,256
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

598
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,551
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

599
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,638
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

600
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,932
You know that, right?

601
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,267
If she finds out

602
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,312
my husband was

603
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,230
in fact shot

604
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,859
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

605
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,820
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

606
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,575
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

607
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,702
is a philosophy she lives by.

608
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,540
Why don't you

609
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,586
go tell her if you have time for this?

610
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,214
For Code 1

611
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:31,593
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

612
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:37,557
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

613
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,143
That's right! Absolutely!

614
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,311
Of course.

615
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,481
The election is in seven days now.

616
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,068
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

617
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,987
Those people need me,

618
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,781
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

619
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,617
They need me! No matter what I've done!

620
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,663
Well done!

621
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,050
Do you think

622
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,387
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

623
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,766
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

624
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,893
kicked out of a feast.

625
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,479
You wench! I'll kill you!

626
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,231
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

627
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,232
Ma'am.

628
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,316
-Let go of me!
-What?

629
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,744
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

630
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,579
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

631
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,250
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

632
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,502
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

633
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,130
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

634
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,009
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

635
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,260
<i>What do I do?</i>

636
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,970
Get me out of here. Please!

637
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,306
Of course! Listen.

638
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,142
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.

639
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
There are windows there.

640
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,354
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

641
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,689
Okay. Hurry up.

642
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,024
I'm so scared.

643
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,860
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

644
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:16,031
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

645
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,199
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

646
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,162
Captain!

647
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,456
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

648
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,999
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

649
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,464
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

650
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,175
Is someone escaping through the basement?

651
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,259
Honey!

652
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,054
I love you!

653
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,889
Go back home. Now!

654
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,474
Go now!

655
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,019
What's gotten into him?

656
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,481
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

657
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,905
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

658
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,223
Stay safe.

659
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,274
You too.

660
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,788
Good luck.

661
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,722
Promise me…

662
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,979
you'll leave with me if I come back.

663
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,416
I guess I must come back

664
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,543
to hear your answer.

665
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,821
Han-na, listen carefully.

666
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,575
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

667
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,829
What?

668
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:14,209
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

669
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,962
I'm sure they're more than that.

670
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,965
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

671
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,301
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

672
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,430
Okay.

673
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,393
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

674
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,980
And she will soon

675
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:40,026
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

676
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,196
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

677
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,409
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.

678
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,359
-Careful.
-Damn it.

679
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,278
Turn on the lights. There.

680
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,324
You're home!

681
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,327
I'm so relieved.

682
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,414
I'm not dreaming, am I?

683
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,960
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

684
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,215
That hurts so much.

685
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,594
Do you know how much I resented you?

686
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,972
I know I told you to leave,

687
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,975
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

688
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,227
What do you mean, run?

689
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,146
I was scared they might blow you up.

690
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,983
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

691
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,694
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

692
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,946
I chose to retreat to save you.

693
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,074
God, do you know how sad I was?

694
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,410
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

695
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,662
So I decided to escape at all costs.

696
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,249
You did well. I've been thinking

697
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,878
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

698
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,215
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

699
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,510
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

700
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,053
and shooting the ANSP director.

701
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,598
Those damn bastards.

702
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,268
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

703
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,563
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

704
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,566
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

705
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,860
It must've been hard for you.

706
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,445
You did well.

707
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,824
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

708
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,412
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

709
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,164
Let's go.

710
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,189
Dad…

711
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,371
Dad…

712
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,058
Please… Dad…

713
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,303
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

714
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,929
Help the less fortunate.

715
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,224
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

716
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:07,395
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

717
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,189
We still have as many as six days left.

718
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,777
You're number two in the ANSP now.

719
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,031
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

720
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,118
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

721
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,703
A scam?

722
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,664
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

723
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:32,003
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

724
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,254
With that much money,

725
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:37,342
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

726
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,054
-A hundred?
-Yes!

727
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,598
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

728
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,893
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

729
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,855
The President?

730
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,821
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

731
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,825
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

732
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,329
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

733
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,088
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

734
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,673
Those bastards

735
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,633
even strapped bombs

736
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,177
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

737
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,554
Will you keep letting me down?

738
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,268
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

739
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,770
I apologize.

740
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,816
But the truth is, because Director Eun

741
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,943
failed to keep his man under control,

742
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,821
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

743
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:44,033
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.

744
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,044
The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

745
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:59,173
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

746
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,970
If you say yes,

747
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,556
I will put an end to it at once.

748
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,034
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

749
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,788
I really appreciate it, sir!

750
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,617
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

751
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,816
How on earth…

752
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,276
Weren't you

753
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,738
being held hostage in the dorm?

754
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,831
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

755
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:14,851
Mother…

756
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:19,397
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

757
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,940
once again before she dies.

758
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,321
What do you need me to do?

759
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,965
They're all useless.

760
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,968
But I've picked out just a few

761
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,638
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

762
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,021
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

763
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,775
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

764
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,861
so you should never miss them.

765
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,905
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

766
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,826
"So precious," you say?

767
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,913
That person will change your life

768
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,664
completely.

769
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,393
Ms. Kim!

770
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,854
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

771
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:48,069
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

772
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,112
I guess so.

773
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:53,324
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

774
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,284
Yes. She's getting changed.

775
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,912
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

776
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,247
Oh, is that so?

777
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,260
She's a foreigner.

778
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,440
Oh, my.

779
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,907
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

780
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,660
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.

781
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,322
She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

782
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,033
for a private equity fund that she made.

783
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,493
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

784
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,996
I'm sure it is.

785
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:31,714
So only one spot's left?

786
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,895
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

787
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,104
Oh, my.

788
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,108
My goodness. Thank you so much.

789
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,903
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

790
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:05,873
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

791
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,502
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

792
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,838
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

793
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,549
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

794
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,718
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

795
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,513
I did everything you told me to do.

796
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:06,600
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

797
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,978
Nam Tae-il…

798
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,856
must not find out.

799
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,691
Of course.

800
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:17,361
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

801
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,116
You were very lucky.

802
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,743
He said only 13 people would die…

803
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,207
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

804
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,502
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

805
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,005
just graze your ribs a little?

806
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,507
The deity kept you safe.

807
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,510
Now…

808
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,642
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

809
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,486
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

810
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,238
Keep up the good work.

811
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,699
I've got to say,

812
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,911
she's a good luck charm.

813
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,663
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

814
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,498
Wait.

815
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,377
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

816
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,591
My God.

817
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,344
Hello?

818
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,221
Hello?

819
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:31,227
Just when I was about to call you!

820
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,772
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

821
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,441
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

822
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,486
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

823
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,488
How about the Maldives?

824
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,866
You precious little fox.

825
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,868
Sure.

826
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,287
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

827
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,539
Really? You really mean it?

828
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,376
Tell me your passport number then.

829
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:57,711
Okay.

830
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,967
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

831
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,762
I know. Me too.

832
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,565
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

833
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,278
I'd like to open a secret account.

834
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:27,116
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

835
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,827
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

836
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,124
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

837
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,627
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

838
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:44,466
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

839
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,260
Arrest her?

840
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,887
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

841
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,183
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

842
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,019
Who said anything about the agency?

843
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,939
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

844
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,942
That's the only way to save the hostages

845
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,195
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

846
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:31,305
<i>I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't</i>

847
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,432
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

848
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,267
So trust me and be patient.

849
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,019
<i>That's great!</i>

850
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,104
Them blowing themselves up?
That's way better.

851
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,732
<i>What if Kang makes off
with 300 million dollars?</i>

852
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,942
<i>Just trust her and wait for her?</i>

853
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,444
<i>Once she has that much money,</i>

854
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,529
<i>she might flee to another country.</i>

855
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,867
<i>I'll help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.</i>

856
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,998
Your father is the ANSP director?

857
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,501
<i>Isn't he the one trying to kill us all?</i>

858
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,544
<i>Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?</i>

859
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,505
<i>That's so creepy!</i>

860
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,674
I want to help you get out alive.

861
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,469
<i>I'll get in the same car as Soo-ho.</i>

862
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,513
<i>I'm sorry I've put you</i>

863
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,099
<i>through all this.</i>

864
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,976
<i>Soo-ho.</i>

865
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,605
I'll stay by your side until the end.

866
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,445
BONUS

867
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,994
You're Linda Young, a fund manager
at ABK Partners based in Hong Kong.

868
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,664
And you're flying to the New York HQ
tomorrow morning

869
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,541
to have a conference meeting.

870
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,793
I'm Gong Gil-sun,

871
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,879
who used to scam US soldiers in Osaka.

872
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,924
I'm the Gong Gil-sun.
Don't you know my nickname?

873
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,343
Of course I do. "Threatening Gong."
