EPISODE 13

3
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,822
I'll go in first.

4
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:26,327
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

5
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,746
We must kill him.

6
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:31,332
Understood, sir.

7
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:46,639
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

8
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:50,392
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

9
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,562
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

10
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,526
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,035
I'm back, sir.

12
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,249
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

13
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:17,670
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

14
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,839
for our country and people.

15
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,341
He only cares about saving his daughter.

16
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,760
We can't leave our fate to him.

17
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,846
If the election scheme succeeds,

18
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,307
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

19
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:34,895
You must climb the ladder

20
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,149
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

21
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,777
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

22
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:44,530
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

23
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:46,991
Good.

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,558
Yeong-ro.

25
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:29,450
Dad.

26
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,368
Yes?

27
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:37,499
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

28
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,418
Of course not.

29
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:45,466
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

30
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,136
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,972
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

32
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,142
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

33
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,770
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,983
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,360
No, it's not.

36
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:06,862
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

37
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,990
And my brother…

38
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:13,327
Yeong-u…

39
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,623
died because of me.

40
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,797
If my friends die too,

41
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,715
I won't be able to…

42
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,758
Yeong-ro.

43
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,218
Please…

44
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,514
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

45
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:34,598
Don't move!

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,486
Yeong-ro!

47
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:57,413
No!

48
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,589
Were you only going to save me?

49
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,469
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?

50
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,222
What? What the hell is she doing?

51
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,641
Yeong-ro.

52
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,228
Your brother asked me to protect you.

53
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,440
While drawing his last breath,

54
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,323
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

55
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,038
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

56
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,292
Can't you understand that?

57
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,010
Open fire!

58
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,977
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

59
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,771
Damn it. Follow me.

60
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:05,439
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

61
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,648
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

62
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:08,025
Hurry up!

63
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,401
-You, with me!
-Wait.

64
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,944
What about us?

65
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,323
Come in!

66
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:16,241
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

67
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,201
Move back!

68
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,535
Don't shoot!

69
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,499
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

70
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,959
Who the hell is shooting?

71
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,800
Yeong-ro.

72
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,385
Yeong-ro.

73
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,178
It's all right.

74
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:37,930
It's okay.

75
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:39,139
You're safe.

76
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,189
Hold fire!

77
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,192
Kill him.

78
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,028
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

79
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:10,879
Mr. Eun!

80
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:12,423
Mr. Eun!

81
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,092
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

82
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:18,262
Mr. Eun!

83
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,557
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

84
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,684
Damn it!

85
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:24,935
We need a medical team.

86
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,270
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

87
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,604
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

88
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,064
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

89
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,357
Move faster!

90
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,258
I was worried
something had happened to you.

91
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:58,510
I was quite scared.

92
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,846
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

93
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,097
We're all going to die?

94
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,099
Watch what you say.

95
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,476
Shut your own mouth.

96
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,395
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

97
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,814
and you beg your enemy for your life?

98
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,700
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

99
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,620
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

100
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,876
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

101
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:32,544
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

102
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,631
Eung-cheol.

103
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,512
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

104
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,680
Search the room for lanterns.

105
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,974
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

106
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:48,644
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

107
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,108
By yourself?

108
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,239
Untie me.

109
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:03,450
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

110
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:04,826
You can't, Comrade Lim.

111
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,372
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

112
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:13,460
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

113
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,004
Understood.

114
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:36,358
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

115
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,449
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

116
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:48,245
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

117
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,625
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us all…

118
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,547
Hold on.

119
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,217
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

120
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:09,933
The radio.

121
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:11,977
I should find it first.

122
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,233
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

123
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,028
How's Eun?

124
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,281
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

125
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,282
So?

126
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,076
Is he going to make it or not?

127
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,288
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

128
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,831
I'm sure he'll make it.

129
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,918
"What happened?"

130
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,047
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

131
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,423
Are you seriously asking?

132
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,592
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

133
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,304
and those damn spies got him.

134
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,974
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

135
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,103
I mean, last time--

136
00:09:56,104 --> 00:10:00,192
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

137
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:03,070
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

138
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,780
You still think he wouldn't do it?

139
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:07,991
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

140
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,792
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

141
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,461
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

142
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:21,004
Damn it.

143
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,100
Hello?

144
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,560
Hello, doctor. How are you?

145
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,690
He's been shot?

146
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,692
How is he?

147
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,738
You must save him. Please.

148
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,532
Okay. I'll be right over.

149
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,623
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

150
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,002
But they shot the ANSP director?

151
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,131
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

152
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:07,759
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

153
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:09,594
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

154
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,096
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

155
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,015
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

156
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:17,519
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

157
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,188
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

158
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,732
What's going on?

159
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,151
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

160
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,862
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

161
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:29,322
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

162
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,872
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

163
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,583
Until we figure out what's going on,

164
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,502
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

165
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,923
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

166
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:55,182
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

167
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,690
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

168
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,234
My hunch is

169
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:10,197
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

170
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:13,116
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

171
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,202
If that's true,

172
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,371
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

173
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,170
Go to the prayer room.

174
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,856
Right. To the prayer room…

175
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,275
The prayer room.

176
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,503
No!

177
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,583
It's all right.

178
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,045
No one's going to die.

179
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,757
Don't worry.

180
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,773
I apologize, sir.

181
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:10,609
I tried so hard to stop him,

182
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,652
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

183
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,779
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

184
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:18,408
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!

185
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,701
That's not true, sir.

186
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:22,120
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

187
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:24,414
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

188
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,415
<i>Disobeying?</i>

189
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,795
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

190
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,172
our country's fate?

191
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:35,842
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

192
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,636
I will, sir!

193
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,347
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

194
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,973
Don't worry a thing, sir!

195
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,266
I swear on my life--

196
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,695
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

197
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,406
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

198
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,160
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

199
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,206
We have the upper hand now.

200
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,249
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,377
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

202
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,547
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

203
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,508
Then cut off the power.

204
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,511
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

205
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,805
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,408
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

207
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,125
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

208
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,713
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

209
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:56,297
Who did such a horrible thing?

210
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:57,841
It must be Nam Tae-il.

211
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:00,093
Nam Tae-il?

212
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,345
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

213
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,766
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

214
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:09,978
Hold on.

215
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:11,980
<i>Well,</i>

216
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:16,568
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

217
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:19,738
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

218
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,698
<i>and we have decided</i>

219
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,366
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

220
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,618
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

221
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,162
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

222
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,831
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

223
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:34,294
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

224
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:36,379
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

225
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,757
They're making up

226
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:43,178
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

227
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,222
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

228
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,515
Right?

229
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,017
That's obvious.

230
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,979
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

231
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,108
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

232
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:02,947
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

233
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,532
Then…

234
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,576
will it be tonight?

235
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,661
We should get ready to fight right now.

236
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,250
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

237
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,865
To the library?

238
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,284
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

239
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,203
What do we do now?

240
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,497
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

241
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,457
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

242
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,709
Really?

243
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:59,379
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

244
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:02,215
What?

245
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,342
He was shot?

246
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,302
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

247
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,474
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

248
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,685
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

249
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,108
Yeong-ro!

250
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,245
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

251
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:36,332
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

252
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,501
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

253
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,087
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

254
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,464
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

255
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:46,885
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

256
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,387
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

257
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,640
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

258
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,726
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

259
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:58,855
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>

260
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,285
I told you to move in lines!

261
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,496
Move in lines!

262
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:58,831
Move in lines!

263
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,377
Are you okay?

264
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:04,712
My dad…

265
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,923
How did my dad get shot?

266
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:10,051
Go stay in the library. Now!

267
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,469
Take Yeong-ro with you.

268
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,929
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

269
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,646
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

270
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:24,774
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

271
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:29,070
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

272
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,365
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

273
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,951
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

274
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,744
They might blow themselves up!

275
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,668
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

276
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,086
Come on!

277
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:47,755
This is crazy!

278
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:53,344
No. That's too dangerous.

279
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:56,848
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

280
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:59,642
Since Eun is seriously injured,

281
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,270
Nam must be leading the operation.

282
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,356
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

283
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,692
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

284
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,195
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

285
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,656
Hurry up. Time is running out.

286
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,718
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

287
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,304
The first goal of this operation

288
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,475
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

289
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:42,935
And the second goal

290
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,813
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

291
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:46,856
If possible,

292
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,317
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

293
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,236
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

294
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,030
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

295
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,909
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

296
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:00,370
Those damn brats.

297
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:03,623
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

298
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,125
Everyone wait here.

299
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,379
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

300
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,381
Come on, Ms. Oh.

301
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:15,551
Walk slowly.

302
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,514
Slowly!

303
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:21,849
Comrade Joo!

304
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,060
Comrade Joo!

305
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:40,410
Eung-cheol.

306
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,339
If he attacks you again,

307
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,675
don't hesitate to shoot him.

308
00:22:55,758 --> 00:23:00,054
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

309
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:04,350
Go up.

310
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,465
Yeong-ro!

311
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,062
Hey!

312
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,320
No! Don't shoot!

313
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:00,281
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

314
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:02,366
Get down!

315
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,412
Get out!

316
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,680
Get out now!

317
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,876
Come on!

318
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,419
Hurry up! Come on!

319
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:56,814
It's clear, sir.

320
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,286
We'll proceed with the operation.

321
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,371
We're going in.

322
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,646
Room 202, clear.

323
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,730
No targets found.

324
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,399
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

325
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:47,823
Forward!

326
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:06,133
Don't shoot!

327
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:13,224
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

328
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,268
Please help.

329
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,896
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

330
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:20,606
Where are you?

331
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,526
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

332
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:38,082
She's there! All units, hold!

333
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:41,210
Hold! Stay where you are!

334
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,549
If you don't stop the operation,

335
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,051
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

336
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,515
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

337
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,143
M1 dynamite

338
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:59,729
is strapped to her body.

339
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,773
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

340
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,652
we're all going to die here.

341
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:09,572
That goddamn bastard!

342
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,489
One!

343
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:13,409
Help!

344
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,246
-Damn it!
-Two!

345
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,707
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

346
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,626
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

347
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,343
Three!

348
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:32,511
Move aside.

349
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,222
Sir! It's dangerous!

350
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:43,814
Wait, sir!

351
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,525
Cheong-ya.

352
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:49,028
Please. Please don't come any closer.

353
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,030
Please.

354
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,682
God, it burns.

355
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:22,102
Five!

356
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:23,354
I'll save you

357
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:25,689
at all costs.

358
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,901
So hang in-- Damn it!

359
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:30,444
Sir.

360
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,660
Please…

361
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,830
Leave now. Please…

362
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,207
Sir.

363
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,000
Please…

364
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:53,342
Seven!

365
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,814
Abort the mission!

366
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:12,486
All units, retreat!

367
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,738
Eight!

368
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:18,742
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

369
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,911
Let go of me!

370
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:22,788
I'll make sure to come back!

371
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:26,333
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

372
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,503
Retreat!

373
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,255
Retreat!

374
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,841
All units, retreat!

375
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:36,135
Sir! Put on your mask!

376
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,929
Abort the mission! Retreat!

377
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,432
Abort the mission!

378
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:44,435
Retreat!

379
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,680
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

380
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,849
You coward!

381
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,935
Why did you do something so stupid?

382
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,979
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

383
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:34,068
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

384
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:39,198
Quiet!

385
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,285
They've all retreated!

386
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,870
Go wash up now!

387
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:45,913
Hurry up!

388
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:54,713
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

389
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:57,299
Okay.

390
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:03,263
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

391
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:06,058
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

392
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,768
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

393
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:10,854
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

394
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:14,900
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

395
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,238
Mr. Choi.

396
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:20,656
Yes, ma'am?

397
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:25,035
Was it really the spies that shot him?

398
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,872
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

399
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,503
Isn't this an election scheme?

400
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,924
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

401
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:44,638
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

402
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,225
It doesn't make sense.

403
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,147
Well, that's true.

404
00:32:56,442 --> 00:33:00,029
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

405
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,490
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

406
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:10,789
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

407
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:14,043
But you don't have any doubts about it?

408
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,177
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

409
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,387
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

410
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:30,225
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

411
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,271
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

412
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,565
<i>The bombs they have</i>

413
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,902
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

414
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,820
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

415
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,158
The bombs we have are too many?

416
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,161
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

417
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,582
How's Mr. Eun?

418
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,334
They said the surgery went well,

419
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,586
but he's still unconscious.

420
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,297
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

421
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,675
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

422
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,229
Eun is still not conscious.

423
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,773
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

424
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,235
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

425
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:23,320
To make a great contribution

426
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,615
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

427
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:31,995
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

428
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,956
Seeing how they're lying,

429
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,668
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

430
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:40,629
We must let the press know

431
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,632
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

432
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,260
But that's not going to save us.

433
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,474
We must cut off their money.

434
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:58,814
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

435
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:03,944
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?

436
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:11,493
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of money…

437
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,955
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

438
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,790
who wants us dead.

439
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,376
That's right.

440
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:23,589
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

441
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:25,382
But how on earth

442
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,093
will we cut off the money?

443
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:34,183
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

444
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:41,481
Look, doctor.

445
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:46,361
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

446
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:51,491
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

447
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:52,993
And you'll take it from him?

448
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,872
As you all know,

449
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,752
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

450
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:07,341
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

451
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:13,388
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

452
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,057
and how it's managed.

453
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:21,396
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

454
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:27,110
But will it be enough to make it work?

455
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:30,447
An's wife is quite easy to handle

456
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:33,700
because she's very greedy.

457
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,911
And she has a head for managing money,

458
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,039
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

459
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:41,792
That's true. An made quite big money

460
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,711
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

461
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:47,673
I heard him boasting about it.

462
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,930
I'll go out and intercept the money.

463
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:58,517
As long as the money is our possession,

464
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:00,978
they can never set off the bombs.

465
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,108
Can I have a word?

466
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:19,037
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

467
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,207
Can't you see what she's up to?

468
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,209
She wants to get out of here.

469
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,297
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

470
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:32,342
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

471
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:37,306
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

472
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:40,809
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

473
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:43,729
Fine.

474
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:49,151
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

475
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:53,989
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

476
00:37:56,825 --> 00:38:00,537
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

477
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:05,500
All right, fine.

478
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,795
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

479
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:10,881
that large amount of money.

480
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,258
She's coming back here with it?

481
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,177
Do you believe that?

482
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,596
Or are you pretending to?

483
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:22,559
Whichever the case,

484
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:25,771
do you have any other plan?

485
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:27,064
As soon as she gets out--

486
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,525
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

487
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,864
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

488
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,909
How?

489
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,036
How will you?

490
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,582
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

491
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:48,919
who got Eun shot right now.

492
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:52,297
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

493
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,257
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

494
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:00,639
As you say,

495
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:05,060
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

496
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,106
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

497
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,318
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

498
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:17,614
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

499
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,952
So we have

500
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:24,871
a 50-50 chance?

501
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,504
Fine.

502
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,259
Han-na.

503
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:39,010
Han-na, do you copy?

504
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,222
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

505
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:45,434
VIP WARD

506
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,327
Excuse me.

507
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,079
How can I get to the VIP ward?

508
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:08,748
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?

509
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:10,333
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

510
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:12,544
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

511
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:14,379
Doctor.

512
00:40:14,463 --> 00:40:18,592
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

513
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,303
Of course. Don't worry too much.

514
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,974
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

515
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,517
She asked for it.

516
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,186
Sure.

517
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,940
She said I did?

518
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:35,066
Yes.

519
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:49,414
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

520
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,709
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

521
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:24,199
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,411
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

523
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:33,583
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

524
00:41:35,168 --> 00:41:37,671
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

525
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,674
I'll distract them

526
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:43,802
to help you come back in safely.

527
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:48,765
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

528
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,143
And now you're making sure I come back?

529
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:54,354
To be honest,

530
00:41:55,772 --> 00:41:57,274
I still hope

531
00:41:58,233 --> 00:42:00,193
you'll stop being used like me…

532
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:04,364
and leave for another country

533
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:08,159
to live a happy life.

534
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:15,166
But you need to come back

535
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,211
for the hostages,

536
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,380
my comrades,

537
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,676
and my sister Su-hui to live.

538
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,264
Are you

539
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,309
scared that I might…

540
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,315
not come back?

541
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,115
Then give me…

542
00:42:50,452 --> 00:42:52,203
a reason I must

543
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,624
come back.

544
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,462
For instance,

545
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:06,009
"If you come back with the money,

546
00:43:10,847 --> 00:43:15,352
I will leave with you to another country."

547
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,733
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

548
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:27,781
But if I can leave with you…

549
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:46,966
Eun's wife is already moving.

550
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:53,014
You should get ready.

551
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:07,987
Think carefully.

552
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,157
This is

553
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,912
the only way you'll live.

554
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,374
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

555
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,251
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

556
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:22,293
-Salute!
-Salute!

557
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:23,503
Understand, you bastard?

558
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:24,838
-Ma'am!
-What?

559
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:35,473
What are you doing here?

560
00:44:35,557 --> 00:44:37,642
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

561
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:44,441
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

562
00:44:44,524 --> 00:44:46,651
She practically threatened me

563
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,154
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

564
00:44:49,237 --> 00:44:52,365
What? Eun's wife really did that?

565
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:53,491
-Salute!
-Salute!

566
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,326
Mr. Nam.

567
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:10,967
Hello, ma'am!

568
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:23,271
Give us some privacy.

569
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,191
Get out, guys.

570
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:32,489
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

571
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:36,868
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

572
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:10,026
You should really know your place, woman!

573
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:14,197
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

574
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:19,661
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

575
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,622
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

576
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:37,303
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

577
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,514
So did you encourage your husband

578
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,808
to kill my husband?

579
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:45,687
What? Are you out of your mind?

580
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:48,439
Have you gone insane?

581
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:49,482
My goodness.

582
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:53,528
Since your husband, who's aspiring

583
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,782
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

584
00:46:58,366 --> 00:46:59,742
Get it together

585
00:47:00,326 --> 00:47:01,536
and go home, please.

586
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,963
So you're playing innocent?

587
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:14,757
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

588
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:17,176
everyone around you will be questioned

589
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,888
and evidence will turn up.

590
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,723
Will you be okay?

591
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:29,772
Oh, my God.

592
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:34,152
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

593
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:40,867
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

594
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,703
And joining in the President's coup,

595
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,164
the First Lady hates you for it.

596
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,503
God, it's come again.

597
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:55,256
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

598
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,551
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

599
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,638
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

600
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:03,932
You know that, right?

601
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:06,267
If she finds out

602
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,312
my husband was

603
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:11,230
in fact shot

604
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:14,859
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

605
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,820
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

606
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:22,575
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

607
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:24,702
is a philosophy she lives by.

608
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:29,540
Why don't you

609
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,586
go tell her if you have time for this?

610
00:48:35,004 --> 00:48:36,214
For Code 1

611
00:48:36,297 --> 00:48:40,593
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

612
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:46,557
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

613
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,143
That's right! Absolutely!

614
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:50,311
Of course.

615
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:53,481
The election is in seven days now.

616
00:48:54,273 --> 00:48:57,068
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

617
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:58,987
Those people need me,

618
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,781
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

619
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,617
They need me! No matter what I've done!

620
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:08,663
Well done!

621
00:49:19,549 --> 00:49:21,050
Do you think

622
00:49:21,134 --> 00:49:24,387
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

623
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:28,766
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

624
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,893
kicked out of a feast.

625
00:49:31,394 --> 00:49:33,479
You wench! I'll kill you!

626
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,231
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

627
00:49:35,314 --> 00:49:36,232
Ma'am.

628
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:37,316
-Let go of me!
-What?

629
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:47,744
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

630
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:49,579
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

631
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,250
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

632
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,502
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

633
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:59,130
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

634
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:03,009
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

635
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,260
<i>What do I do?</i>

636
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:05,970
Get me out of here. Please!

637
00:50:06,054 --> 00:50:08,306
Of course! Listen.

638
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:11,142
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.

639
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,351
There are windows there.

640
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:15,354
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

641
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:16,689
Okay. Hurry up.

642
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:18,024
I'm so scared.

643
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:20,860
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

644
00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:25,031
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

645
00:50:25,114 --> 00:50:26,199
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

646
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:31,162
Captain!

647
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:33,456
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

648
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:34,999
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

649
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:41,464
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

650
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:44,175
Is someone escaping through the basement?

651
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:45,259
Honey!

652
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:48,054
I love you!

653
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:49,889
Go back home. Now!

654
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:51,474
Go now!

655
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,019
What's gotten into him?

656
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,481
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

657
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:05,905
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

658
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:32,223
Stay safe.

659
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:41,274
You too.

660
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,788
Good luck.

661
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:12,722
Promise me…

662
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:19,979
you'll leave with me if I come back.

663
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,416
I guess I must come back

664
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,543
to hear your answer.

665
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:10,821
Han-na, listen carefully.

666
00:53:10,905 --> 00:53:14,575
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

667
00:53:17,912 --> 00:53:18,829
What?

668
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:23,209
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

669
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:25,962
I'm sure they're more than that.

670
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:28,965
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

671
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:32,301
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

672
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:36,430
Okay.

673
00:53:36,722 --> 00:53:40,393
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

674
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:43,980
And she will soon

675
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:49,026
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

676
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,196
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

677
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,409
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.

678
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:53,359
-Careful.
-Damn it.

679
00:55:54,777 --> 00:55:56,278
Turn on the lights. There.

680
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:00,324
You're home!

681
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,327
I'm so relieved.

682
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:06,414
I'm not dreaming, am I?

683
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:10,960
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

684
00:56:15,214 --> 00:56:16,215
That hurts so much.

685
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,594
Do you know how much I resented you?

686
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:22,972
I know I told you to leave,

687
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:25,975
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

688
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,227
What do you mean, run?

689
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,146
I was scared they might blow you up.

690
00:56:30,229 --> 00:56:33,983
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

691
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:36,694
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

692
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:38,946
I chose to retreat to save you.

693
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,074
God, do you know how sad I was?

694
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:44,410
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

695
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:46,662
So I decided to escape at all costs.

696
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:50,249
You did well. I've been thinking

697
00:56:50,332 --> 00:56:53,878
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

698
00:56:54,587 --> 00:56:58,215
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

699
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:01,510
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

700
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:03,053
and shooting the ANSP director.

701
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:05,598
Those damn bastards.

702
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,268
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

703
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:12,563
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

704
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:15,566
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

705
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:17,860
It must've been hard for you.

706
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:19,445
You did well.

707
00:57:21,614 --> 00:57:23,824
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

708
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:28,412
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

709
00:57:28,496 --> 00:57:30,164
Let's go.

710
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,189
Dad…

711
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,371
Dad…

712
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:31,058
Please… Dad…

713
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:07,303
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

714
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:08,929
Help the less fortunate.

715
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:12,224
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

716
00:59:12,308 --> 00:59:16,395
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

717
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:19,189
We still have as many as six days left.

718
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:23,777
You're number two in the ANSP now.

719
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:27,031
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

720
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:31,118
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

721
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:32,703
A scam?

722
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:35,664
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

723
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:41,003
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

724
00:59:41,086 --> 00:59:42,254
With that much money,

725
00:59:42,338 --> 00:59:46,342
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

726
00:59:47,968 --> 00:59:50,054
-A hundred?
-Yes!

727
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:52,598
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

728
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,893
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

729
00:59:58,729 --> 00:59:59,855
The President?

730
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,821
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

731
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:11,825
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

732
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:15,329
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

733
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:24,088
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

734
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:25,673
Those bastards

735
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:27,633
even strapped bombs

736
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:30,177
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

737
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,554
Will you keep letting me down?

738
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,268
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

739
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:39,770
I apologize.

740
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:43,816
But the truth is, because Director Eun

741
01:00:43,899 --> 01:00:45,943
failed to keep his man under control,

742
01:00:46,026 --> 01:00:48,821
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

743
01:00:48,904 --> 01:00:53,033
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.

744
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:04,044
The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

745
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:08,173
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

746
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:12,970
If you say yes,

747
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:15,556
I will put an end to it at once.

748
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:36,034
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

749
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,788
I really appreciate it, sir!

750
01:02:14,114 --> 01:02:16,617
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

751
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:48,816
How on earth…

752
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,276
Weren't you

753
01:02:52,194 --> 01:02:54,738
being held hostage in the dorm?

754
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:03,831
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

755
01:03:22,724 --> 01:03:23,851
Mother…

756
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:28,397
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

757
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,940
once again before she dies.

758
01:03:33,235 --> 01:03:36,321
What do you need me to do?

759
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:54,965
They're all useless.

760
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,968
But I've picked out just a few

761
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:01,638
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

762
01:04:06,268 --> 01:04:09,021
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

763
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,775
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

764
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:15,861
so you should never miss them.

765
01:04:15,944 --> 01:04:17,905
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

766
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:22,826
"So precious," you say?

767
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:25,913
That person will change your life

768
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:27,664
completely.

769
01:04:47,434 --> 01:04:48,393
Ms. Kim!

770
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:50,854
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

771
01:04:52,314 --> 01:04:57,069
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

772
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,112
I guess so.

773
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,324
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

774
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:04,284
Yes. She's getting changed.

775
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,912
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

776
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,247
Oh, is that so?

777
01:05:21,176 --> 01:05:22,260
She's a foreigner.

778
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:35,440
Oh, my.

779
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,907
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

780
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:46,660
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.

781
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,322
She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

782
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:26,033
for a private equity fund that she made.

783
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,493
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

784
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:30,996
I'm sure it is.

785
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:40,714
So only one spot's left?

786
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:54,895
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

787
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,104
Oh, my.

788
01:06:57,022 --> 01:07:00,108
My goodness. Thank you so much.

789
01:07:00,192 --> 01:07:02,903
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

790
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:14,873
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

791
01:07:14,956 --> 01:07:18,502
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

792
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:21,838
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

793
01:07:21,922 --> 01:07:24,549
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

794
01:07:24,633 --> 01:07:26,718
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

795
01:08:09,344 --> 01:08:11,513
I did everything you told me to do.

796
01:08:11,596 --> 01:08:15,600
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

797
01:08:16,476 --> 01:08:17,978
Nam Tae-il…

798
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:20,856
must not find out.

799
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:22,691
Of course.

800
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:26,361
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

801
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:31,116
You were very lucky.

802
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:33,743
He said only 13 people would die…

803
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:39,207
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

804
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,502
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

805
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:45,005
just graze your ribs a little?

806
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,507
The deity kept you safe.

807
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:50,510
Now…

808
01:08:53,555 --> 01:08:57,642
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

809
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:08,486
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

810
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,238
Keep up the good work.

811
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:12,699
I've got to say,

812
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:15,911
she's a good luck charm.

813
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:18,663
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

814
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:20,498
Wait.

815
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:24,377
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

816
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,591
My God.

817
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:32,344
Hello?

818
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,221
Hello?

819
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:40,227
Just when I was about to call you!

820
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,772
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

821
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:46,441
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

822
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:49,486
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

823
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:51,488
How about the Maldives?

824
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:54,866
You precious little fox.

825
01:09:55,617 --> 01:09:56,868
Sure.

826
01:09:56,952 --> 01:09:59,287
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

827
01:09:59,371 --> 01:10:01,539
Really? You really mean it?

828
01:10:02,624 --> 01:10:04,376
Tell me your passport number then.

829
01:10:05,877 --> 01:10:06,711
Okay.

830
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,967
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

831
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,762
I know. Me too.

832
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:27,565
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

833
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:31,278
I'd like to open a secret account.

834
01:10:32,737 --> 01:10:36,116
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

835
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,827
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

836
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,124
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

837
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,627
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

838
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:53,466
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

839
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:55,260
Arrest her?

840
01:10:55,844 --> 01:10:57,887
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

841
01:10:59,973 --> 01:11:02,183
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

842
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:04,019
Who said anything about the agency?

843
01:11:04,644 --> 01:11:07,939
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

844
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,942
That's the only way to save the hostages

845
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:14,195
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

846
01:11:37,385 --> 01:11:40,305
<i>I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't</i>

847
01:11:40,388 --> 01:11:42,432
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

848
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:44,267
So trust me and be patient.

849
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:46,019
<i>That's great!</i>

850
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,104
Them blowing themselves up?
That's way better.

851
01:11:48,188 --> 01:11:50,732
<i>What if Kang makes off
with 300 million dollars?</i>

852
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:52,942
<i>Just trust her and wait for her?</i>

853
01:11:53,026 --> 01:11:54,444
<i>Once she has that much money,</i>

854
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,529
<i>she might flee to another country.</i>

855
01:11:58,365 --> 01:12:00,867
<i>I'll help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.</i>

856
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,998
Your father is the ANSP director?

857
01:12:07,082 --> 01:12:09,501
<i>Isn't he the one trying to kill us all?</i>

858
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:11,544
<i>Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?</i>

859
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:13,505
<i>That's so creepy!</i>

860
01:12:13,588 --> 01:12:16,674
I want to help you get out alive.

861
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:19,469
<i>I'll get in the same car as Soo-ho.</i>

862
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:21,513
<i>I'm sorry I've put you</i>

863
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:24,099
<i>through all this.</i>

864
01:12:25,725 --> 01:12:26,976
<i>Soo-ho.</i>

865
01:12:27,602 --> 01:12:30,605
I'll stay by your side until the end.

866
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,445
BONUS

867
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:44,994
You're Linda Young, a fund manager
at ABK Partners based in Hong Kong.

868
01:12:45,537 --> 01:12:47,664
And you're flying to the New York HQ
tomorrow morning

869
01:12:47,747 --> 01:12:49,541
to have a conference meeting.

870
01:12:49,624 --> 01:12:51,793
I'm Gong Gil-sun,

871
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:54,879
who used to scam US soldiers in Osaka.

872
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:57,924
I'm the Gong Gil-sun.
Don't you know my nickname?

873
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,343
Of course I do. "Threatening Gong."
