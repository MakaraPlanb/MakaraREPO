EPISODE 13

3
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,722
I'll go in first.

4
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:26,227
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.
Then come in through the shrine.

5
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,646
We must kill him.

6
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,232
Understood, sir.

7
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:46,539
Captain, kill them all
when I give the order to shoot.

8
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:50,292
You're an expert marksman,
so I trust you not to miss any of them.

9
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:53,462
You must get rid of them
without getting caught.

10
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,426
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take out anything that moves.

11
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:07,935
I'm back, sir.

12
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,149
He's still the director of the ANSP.
Will it be okay?

13
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,570
Hui-jun, I'm doing this

14
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,739
for our country and people.

15
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:22,241
He only cares about saving his daughter.

16
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,660
We can't leave our fate to him.

17
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,746
If the election scheme succeeds,

18
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,207
I'll make you a member of Dongsim Society.

19
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,795
You must climb the ladder

20
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:38,049
to help me become
the presidential candidate.

21
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,677
The moment I entered the Military Academy,

22
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,430
I swore to serve you, Tae-il.

23
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,891
Good.

24
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,458
Yeong-ro.

25
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:29,350
Dad.

26
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:31,268
Yes?

27
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:37,399
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

28
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,318
Of course not.

29
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:45,366
-Who told you that? That's absurd.
-Please stop it.

30
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,036
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,872
What are you talking about?
I really want to save you.

32
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:55,042
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

33
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,670
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,883
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,260
No, it's not.

36
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,762
-Why do you think that way?
-Don't move.

37
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,890
And my brother…

38
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,227
Yeong-u…

39
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,523
died because of me.

40
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,697
If my friends die too,

41
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,615
I won't be able to…

42
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,658
Yeong-ro.

43
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,118
Please…

44
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,414
I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

45
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,498
Don't move!

46
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,386
Yeong-ro!

47
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:57,313
No!

48
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,489
Were you only going to save me?

49
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,369
You were going to kill him
and all my friends inside, weren't you?

50
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:15,122
What? What the hell is she doing?

51
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:17,541
Yeong-ro.

52
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,128
Your brother asked me to protect you.

53
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,340
While drawing his last breath,

54
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:32,223
Yeong-u asked me to keep you safe.

55
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:38,938
I want to save you first
because you're my daughter.

56
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,192
Can't you understand that?

57
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:52,910
Open fire!

58
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,877
<i>What was that? Are they going in
without telling me?</i>

59
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,671
Damn it. Follow me.

60
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,339
Hey, Woo! Follow me with the camera!

61
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:06,548
-Hurry! Block the rest!
-What?

62
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:07,925
Hurry up!

63
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,301
-You, with me!
-Wait.

64
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:10,844
What about us?

65
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,223
Come in!

66
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,141
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

67
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,101
Move back!

68
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,435
Don't shoot!

69
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,399
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

70
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,859
Who the hell is shooting?

71
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:32,700
Yeong-ro.

72
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,285
Yeong-ro.

73
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,078
It's all right.

74
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:37,830
It's okay.

75
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,039
You're safe.

76
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:47,089
Hold fire!

77
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:50,092
Kill him.

78
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,928
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

79
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:10,779
Mr. Eun!

80
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,323
Mr. Eun!

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,992
-Mr. Eun.
-They brought a reporter.

82
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:18,162
Mr. Eun!

83
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,457
Move aside. Mr. Eun!

84
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,584
Damn it!

85
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,835
We need a medical team.

86
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,170
-Bring a stretcher!
-I repeat!

87
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,504
-Hurry!
-The director's down.

88
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,964
-Mr. Eun's unconscious!
-Hurry up.

89
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,257
Move faster!

90
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:56,158
I was worried
something had happened to you.

91
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,410
I was quite scared.

92
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,746
We're all going to die in a week anyway.

93
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:01,997
We're all going to die?

94
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:03,999
Watch what you say.

95
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,376
Shut your own mouth.

96
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,295
You're a warrior of our great Republic,

97
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,714
and you beg your enemy for your life?

98
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,600
And a romance
with the ANSP director's daughter?

99
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,520
Just for that,
you should be shot to death.

100
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,776
<i>The ANSP director's daughter?</i>

101
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,444
<i>Yeong-ro?</i>

102
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,531
Eung-cheol.

103
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:41,412
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

104
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:43,580
Search the room for lanterns.

105
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,874
They'll cut off the power
before breaking in.

106
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,544
If they come in, I'll defend the basement.

107
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:55,008
By yourself?

108
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:00,139
Untie me.

109
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:03,350
You're not telling me to die
by enemy hands tied up like this, are you?

110
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:04,726
You can't, Comrade Lim.

111
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,272
If we untie him,
he'll try to kill you first.

112
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,360
If the power is cut off,
come up to the second floor with him.

113
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,904
Understood.

114
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:36,258
What do I do? I have to find
a way out before they break in.

115
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,349
That damn wench. What a sly minx.

116
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:48,145
She's been pretending to be
a rice cake shop's daughter all this time?

117
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,525
The daughter of the ANSP director
who might kill us all…

118
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,447
Hold on.

119
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:02,117
What if I use that fact to my advantage?

120
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:09,833
The radio.

121
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,877
I should find it first.

122
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,133
Why aren't you saluting me? Huh?

123
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:20,928
How's Eun?

124
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:24,181
The wound is severe, so they'll know
for sure after the surgery.

125
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,182
So?

126
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,976
Is he going to make it or not?

127
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,188
The best surgeon in Korea
is doing the surgery.

128
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,731
I'm sure he'll make it.

129
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,818
"What happened?"

130
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,947
The reporters keep asking me that.
What should I--

131
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,323
Are you seriously asking?

132
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,492
He tried to go in to save his daughter…

133
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,204
and those damn spies got him.

134
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,874
Lim Soo-ho shot him? In front of Yeong-ro?

135
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,003
I mean, last time--

136
00:09:56,004 --> 00:10:00,092
Listen, you bastard.
Don't you know he's an armed Northern spy?

137
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,970
You saw how frantically he provoked us.

138
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,680
You still think he wouldn't do it?

139
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:07,891
Understood, sir. I'll tell the reporters
that's what happened.

140
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,692
<i>If people think Eun got shot trying to
negotiate with them to save the hostages,</i>

141
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:19,361
<i>he will be hailed as a hero, again.</i>

142
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,904
Damn it.

143
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello?

144
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,460
Hello, doctor. How are you?

145
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,590
He's been shot?

146
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,592
How is he?

147
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:46,638
You must save him. Please.

148
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,432
Okay. I'll be right over.

149
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:56,523
It was supposed to be a put-up job.

150
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,902
But they shot the ANSP director?

151
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,031
<i>MBS breaking news.</i>

152
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:07,659
<i>Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies</i>

153
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,494
<i>near the Hosu University dorm.</i>

154
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:10,996
<i>In an unprecedented turn of events,</i>

155
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,915
<i>two SWAT team members
were killed at the scene.</i>

156
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,419
<i>We'll hear from our reporter
on the scene for further details.</i>

157
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:20,088
<i>-Reporter Wi?</i>
-Those goddamn bastards…

158
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,632
What's going on?

159
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,051
That's a lie. Don't believe what they say.

160
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,762
There are people
killed or hurt, but you didn't shoot?

161
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,222
Are you saying it was friendly fire then?

162
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,772
The last thing we want is to make the
public angrier. Why would we shoot them?

163
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,483
Until we figure out what's going on,

164
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,402
you should all stay
in the prayer room. Now.

165
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,823
Get up, everyone. Let's go. Now.

166
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:55,082
Yeong-ro failed
to convince her father, didn't she?

167
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:03,590
Anyway, who shot them?
You must have a hunch.

168
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,134
My hunch is

169
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:10,097
that Eun Chang-su is opposing using force
because of Yeong-ro,

170
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:13,016
so they took the opportunity
to get rid of him.

171
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,102
If that's true,

172
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,271
they won't hesitate to kill the students.

173
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,070
Go to the prayer room.

174
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,756
Right. To the prayer room…

175
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,175
The prayer room.

176
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,403
No!

177
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,483
It's all right.

178
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,945
No one's going to die.

179
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,657
Don't worry.

180
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,673
I apologize, sir.

181
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:10,509
I tried so hard to stop him,

182
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:12,552
but he went to get his daughter out, and…

183
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,679
How dare they shoot my right-hand man!

184
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:18,308
They're just pawns. They wouldn't
have done it without the North's orders!

185
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,601
That's not true, sir.

186
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,020
Since they found out
the North was trying to kill them,

187
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,314
they've been disobeying
their country's orders.

188
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,315
<i>Disobeying?</i>

189
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,695
They sent such idiots to carry out
this crucial scheme that will decide

190
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,072
our country's fate?

191
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:35,742
Go and kill those
commie bastards yourself right now!

192
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,536
I will, sir!

193
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,247
I will go in and kill them myself tonight!

194
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,873
Don't worry a thing, sir!

195
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,166
I swear on my life--

196
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,595
<i>God damn it. Since when
was Eun Chang-su his right-hand man?</i>

197
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,306
<i>Didn't he say
he wanted to watch the Olympics with me?</i>

198
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,060
Will it be okay if the hostage situation
doesn't last until the election?

199
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,106
We have the upper hand now.

200
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,149
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,277
We'll take them out secretly and quickly.

202
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,447
Prepare two teams of the most
loyal guys with good combat skills.

203
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,408
Then cut off the power.

204
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,411
We will go retake the dorm in ten minutes.

205
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:21,705
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,308
KANG CHEONG-YA
DOCTOR

207
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:50,025
<i>Seriously wounded, the ANSP director
is being taken to the hospital.</i>

208
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:54,613
<i>And two SWAT team members were killed.
It's such a brutal tragedy.</i>

209
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,197
Who did such a horrible thing?

210
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,741
It must be Nam Tae-il.

211
00:15:59,034 --> 00:15:59,993
Nam Tae-il?

212
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:02,245
They both aspire
to presidential candidacy.

213
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:06,666
Tae-il has been keeping an eye
on Eun for a long time.

214
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:09,878
Hold on.

215
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,880
<i>Well,</i>

216
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:16,468
<i>we have been trying
to resolve this situation peacefully.</i>

217
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:19,638
<i>However, this incident triggered
public anger,</i>

218
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,598
<i>and we have decided</i>

219
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,266
<i>we can no longer ignore it.</i>

220
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,518
<i>Therefore, the ANSP is declaring</i>

221
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,062
<i>that as of this moment,</i>

222
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,731
<i>we will take a hard line without mercy.</i>

223
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:34,194
<i>Fellow citizens, we will not let them
have their way anymore.</i>

224
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:36,279
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

225
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,657
They're making up

226
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:43,078
a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

227
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:46,122
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

228
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,415
Right?

229
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:48,917
That's obvious.

230
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,879
The hostages know
this is their election scheme.

231
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,008
On top of that, you and Gang-mu
are working together to ruin it.

232
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:02,847
Now Tae-il has no reason to wait
until the election to end this situation.

233
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,432
Then…

234
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,476
will it be tonight?

235
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,561
We should get ready to fight right now.

236
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:14,150
Now that Eun's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

237
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,765
To the library?

238
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,184
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

239
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,103
What do we do now?

240
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:52,397
Stop the nonsense and find your mask!

241
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,357
Hurry! They're going
to raid this place soon.

242
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,609
Really?

243
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,279
Two cops were killed,
and the ANSP director was shot.

244
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,115
What?

245
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,242
He was shot?

246
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,202
Why are you so surprised?
You heard gunfire.

247
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,374
Yeong-ro, what are you doing?
Find your mask and lantern!

248
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,585
Hurry up!
We have to go to the library asap!

249
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,008
Yeong-ro!

250
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,145
<i>After the incident,
Director Eun of the ANSP</i>

251
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:36,232
<i>was taken to Hankuk Central Medical Center
and is in surgery as we speak.</i>

252
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,401
<i>According to the medical staff, the bullet</i>

253
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,987
<i>missed the aorta,
which prevented immediate death.</i>

254
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,364
<i>They say they will know for sure
after the surgery</i>

255
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:46,785
<i>and are not sure yet
if the surgery is going well.</i>

256
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,287
<i>Meanwhile, some are worried</i>

257
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,540
<i>that Director Eun might end up
in critical condition</i>

258
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,626
<i>even if the surgery goes well.</i>

259
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:58,755
<i>By the looks of it, he might be
unconscious and on a ventilator--</i>

260
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,185
I told you to move in lines!

261
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,396
Move in lines!

262
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:58,731
Move in lines!

263
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:02,277
Are you okay?

264
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:04,612
My dad…

265
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,823
How did my dad get shot?

266
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,951
Go stay in the library. Now!

267
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,369
Take Yeong-ro with you.

268
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,829
Let's go, Yeong-ro.

269
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,546
Hey! Seol-hui! Here!

270
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,674
-Seol-hui!
-Gwang-tae!

271
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,970
Listen carefully.
We can't stay here and get killed.

272
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:32,265
It's better to escape here
and cooperate with the ANSP.

273
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,851
He's right. We can't trust these guys.

274
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,644
They might blow themselves up!

275
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,568
Hurry up, Hye-ryeong!

276
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:44,986
Come on!

277
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,655
This is crazy!

278
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:53,244
No. That's too dangerous.

279
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:56,748
Is there any way to ward them off
other than this?

280
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,542
Since Eun is seriously injured,

281
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,170
Nam must be leading the operation.

282
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:05,256
It's worth a shot if it's Nam.

283
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,592
If this is one of your tricks,
you better stop.

284
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:11,095
Because I'll be right behind you
pointing my gun at you.

285
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,556
Hurry up. Time is running out.

286
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:33,618
As you know, the armed spies are occupying
the Hosu University dorm.

287
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,204
The first goal of this operation

288
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:40,375
is to kill the Northern spies
and everyone helping them.

289
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,835
And the second goal

290
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:45,713
is to rescue Dr. Kang.

291
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:46,756
If possible,

292
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,217
we'll rescue Dr. Kang.

293
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,136
Everyone here? Is anyone missing?

294
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,930
Hye-ryeong and Seol-hui are not here.

295
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,809
Gwang-tae and Byeong-tae
aren't here either.

296
00:21:57,892 --> 00:22:00,270
Those damn brats.

297
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,523
Wait. What if they're trying
to sneak away by themselves?

298
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,025
Everyone wait here.

299
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,279
-Where are you going?
-I need to go to the cafeteria.

300
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,281
Come on, Ms. Oh.

301
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:15,451
Walk slowly.

302
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,414
Slowly!

303
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,749
Comrade Joo!

304
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,960
Comrade Joo!

305
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:40,310
Eung-cheol.

306
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,239
If he attacks you again,

307
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,575
don't hesitate to shoot him.

308
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:59,954
I will. I will put a hole in his head.

309
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,250
Go up.

310
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:35,365
Yeong-ro!

311
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:49,962
Hey!

312
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,220
No! Don't shoot!

313
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:00,181
I passed the Civil Service Exam for--

314
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:02,266
Get down!

315
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:06,312
Get out!

316
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,580
Get out now!

317
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:53,776
Come on!

318
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,319
Hurry up! Come on!

319
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:56,714
It's clear, sir.

320
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,186
We'll proceed with the operation.

321
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,271
We're going in.

322
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,546
Room 202, clear.

323
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,630
No targets found.

324
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,299
<i>Lounge, clear. No targets found.</i>

325
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:47,723
Forward!

326
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:06,033
Don't shoot!

327
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:13,124
I'm Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
from Hankuk Central Medical Center.

328
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,168
Please help.

329
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:18,796
Dr. Kang! I'm Nam Tae-il!

330
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,506
Where are you?

331
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,426
Come on out, ma'am! We'll protect you!

332
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:37,982
She's there! All units, hold!

333
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:41,110
Hold! Stay where you are!

334
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,449
If you don't stop the operation,

335
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,951
I can't guarantee Dr. Kang's safety!

336
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,415
We don't mind blowing ourselves up.

337
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,043
M1 dynamite

338
00:27:58,169 --> 00:27:59,629
is strapped to her body.

339
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:02,673
If you don't leave on the count of ten,

340
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,552
we're all going to die here.

341
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:09,472
That goddamn bastard!

342
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,389
One!

343
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:13,309
Help!

344
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:17,146
-Damn it!
-Two!

345
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,607
I visually confirm
at least ten sticks of dynamite!

346
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,526
We can't retake the dorm
in this situation!

347
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:31,243
Three!

348
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,411
Move aside.

349
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:35,122
Sir! It's dangerous!

350
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,714
Wait, sir!

351
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,425
Cheong-ya.

352
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,928
Please. Please don't come any closer.

353
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,930
Please.

354
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,582
God, it burns.

355
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:22,002
Five!

356
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,254
I'll save you

357
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:25,589
at all costs.

358
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,801
So hang in-- Damn it!

359
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:30,344
Sir.

360
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,560
Please…

361
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,730
Leave now. Please…

362
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,107
Sir.

363
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,900
Please…

364
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:53,242
Seven!

365
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:06,714
Abort the mission!

366
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:12,386
All units, retreat!

367
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,638
Eight!

368
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:18,642
I told you, we're retreating right now!
You're just rats in a trap!

369
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:20,811
Let go of me!

370
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:22,688
I'll make sure to come back!

371
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:26,233
I will come back
and blow your heads off, you bastards!

372
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,403
Retreat!

373
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,155
Retreat!

374
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,741
All units, retreat!

375
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:36,035
Sir! Put on your mask!

376
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,829
Abort the mission! Retreat!

377
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:41,332
Abort the mission!

378
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,335
Retreat!

379
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:21,580
You jerk! You're such an idiot!

380
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,749
You coward!

381
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,835
Why did you do something so stupid?

382
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,879
If it weren't for Soo-ho,
you would've all been killed!

383
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:33,968
It's really true
they're trying to kill us all!

384
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,098
Quiet!

385
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:43,185
They've all retreated!

386
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,770
Go wash up now!

387
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:45,813
Hurry up!

388
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:54,613
Eung-cheol, lock Comrade Joo and Ms. Oh
in the basement.

389
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:57,199
Okay.

390
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:03,163
<i>It's been confirmed that Director Eun, who
was taken to the hospital and had surgery,</i>

391
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,958
<i>is in critical condition at the moment.</i>

392
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,668
<i>Director Eun was injured</i>

393
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,754
<i>while trying to rescue
the hostages himself,</i>

394
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:14,800
<i>so many citizens are praying
that he get better soon--</i>

395
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,138
Mr. Choi.

396
00:32:19,722 --> 00:32:20,556
Yes, ma'am?

397
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:24,935
Was it really the spies that shot him?

398
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,772
Pardon? I'm not sure what you're asking.

399
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:34,403
Isn't this an election scheme?

400
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,824
The North and South planned
this hostage situation together.

401
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:44,538
But the mere pawns dared to shoot
the director of the ANSP?

402
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,125
It doesn't make sense.

403
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,047
Well, that's true.

404
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:59,929
But Mr. Eun went in to save his daughter,
and the spies--

405
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:03,390
I can't wrap my head
around this situation.

406
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:10,689
Your boss has been shot, Mr. Choi.

407
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,943
But you don't have any doubts about it?

408
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,077
<i>Confronting their frantic provocation,</i>

409
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,287
<i>we tried to take them down using force,</i>

410
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:30,125
<i>but the spies
strapped bombs to all 34 hostages.</i>

411
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:34,171
<i>So we had no choice but to
regretfully retreat for their safety.</i>

412
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,465
<i>The bombs they have</i>

413
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,802
<i>are too many for this hostage-taking</i>

414
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,720
<i>to have been accidental…</i>

415
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,058
The bombs we have are too many?

416
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:49,061
So this is how these bastards
are covering it up?

417
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,482
How's Mr. Eun?

418
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,234
They said the surgery went well,

419
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:57,486
but he's still unconscious.

420
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,197
Keep monitoring him. And Han-na,

421
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:03,575
<i>stay safe. Over and out.</i>

422
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,129
Eun is still not conscious.

423
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,673
Before Eun Chang-su comes around,

424
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:21,135
Nam Tae-il will desperately
try to end this hostage situation.

425
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,220
To make a great contribution

426
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,515
and make up
for trying to kill Eun Chang-su.

427
00:34:28,642 --> 00:34:31,895
Bombs strapped to the hostages
and too many bombs…

428
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,856
Seeing how they're lying,

429
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,568
I think they're planning
to set off the bombs around the dorm.

430
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,529
We must let the press know

431
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:43,532
that they're going to blow up the dorm.

432
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,160
But that's not going to save us.

433
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,374
We must cut off their money.

434
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:58,714
If we do that, both the South and
the North won't be able to kill us rashly.

435
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,844
You mean the money
the South is going to send the North?

436
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:11,393
If we can get our hands
on that huge amount of money…

437
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,855
We might be able
to make a deal with Lim Ji-rok,

438
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,690
who wants us dead.

439
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:19,276
That's right.

440
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:23,489
Then we will have the upper hand
in this damn game.

441
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,282
But how on earth

442
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:27,993
will we cut off the money?

443
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:34,083
I will go out there
and intercept the money.

444
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:41,381
Look, doctor.

445
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:46,261
You're talking absolute nonsense.
You know that, right?

446
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:51,391
An Gyeong-hui is the Chief of the OPC
and in charge of the money.

447
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,893
And you'll take it from him?

448
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,772
As you all know,

449
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:01,652
I can find out
Nam Tae-il's real intentions if I want.

450
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:07,241
He's the ruling party's secretary-general
and the former ANSP director.

451
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:13,288
I'm sure he knows inside out how much
is supposed to be paid to the North

452
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,957
and how it's managed.

453
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,296
Besides, An's wife and I are acquainted.

454
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:27,010
But will it be enough to make it work?

455
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:30,347
An's wife is quite easy to handle

456
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:33,600
because she's very greedy.

457
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,811
And she has a head for managing money,

458
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,939
so she has complete control
over her husband when it comes to money.

459
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,692
That's true. An made quite big money

460
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:44,611
by using the ANSP's
secret fund as his wife said.

461
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,573
I heard him boasting about it.

462
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,830
I'll go out and intercept the money.

463
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,417
As long as the money is our possession,

464
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,878
they can never set off the bombs.

465
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,008
Can I have a word?

466
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:18,937
I found it weird when she suggested the
dynamite bit. This is what she was after.

467
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,107
Can't you see what she's up to?

468
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,109
She wants to get out of here.

469
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:28,197
If that was her goal,
she would've told Nam Tae-il.

470
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:32,242
That the dynamite
and detonator were dummies.

471
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:37,206
Then they would've killed
all the hostages who know she's a spy.

472
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:40,709
She helped us instead,
but you're suspecting her?

473
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,629
Fine.

474
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:49,051
Let's say I'm convinced and we trust her.

475
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,889
How will she intercept that huge money?
You think it's even possible?

476
00:37:56,725 --> 00:38:00,437
Don't underestimate what she's capable of.

477
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:05,400
All right, fine.

478
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,695
Let's say
our great Comrade Kang intercepts

479
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,781
that large amount of money.

480
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:13,158
She's coming back here with it?

481
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,077
Do you believe that?

482
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,496
Or are you pretending to?

483
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:22,459
Whichever the case,

484
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:25,671
do you have any other plan?

485
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,964
As soon as she gets out--

486
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:30,425
As soon as she gets out of here,
they'll blow the dorm up.

487
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,764
We'll stop Nam from doing that.

488
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:38,809
How?

489
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,936
How will you?

490
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,482
Tell Eun's wife that Nam's the one

491
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,819
who got Eun shot right now.

492
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,197
And that he's planning
to blow up this dorm.

493
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:54,157
She'll stop it since her daughter's here.

494
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:00,539
As you say,

495
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:04,960
even if Kang doesn't come back here,

496
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,006
I have no choice but to bet on this plan.

497
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,218
If we do nothing,
we have no chance of getting out alive.

498
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,514
But with this plan,
we have a 50-50 chance.

499
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,852
So we have

500
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,771
a 50-50 chance?

501
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,404
Fine.

502
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,159
Han-na.

503
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:38,910
Han-na, do you copy?

504
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:42,122
Tell Director Eun's wife this right away.

505
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:45,334
VIP WARD

506
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:04,227
Excuse me.

507
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:05,979
How can I get to the VIP ward?

508
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:08,648
-The VIP ward?
-You're looking for the VIP ward?

509
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:10,233
Director Eun of the ANSP, right?

510
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:12,444
-I'll tell her.
-Yes, doctor.

511
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,279
Doctor.

512
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:18,492
How is the director doing?
He'll wake up soon, right?

513
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,203
Of course. Don't worry too much.

514
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:25,874
Oh, right. Could you give this
to his wife for me?

515
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,417
She asked for it.

516
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,086
Sure.

517
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:33,840
She said I did?

518
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:34,966
Yes.

519
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,314
<i>I have something to tell you
about how Mr. Eun was shot.</i>

520
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,609
<i>I'll be waiting
in the ladies' room downstairs.</i>

521
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:24,099
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,311
-Let's go to the camp.
-Yes, ma'am.

523
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:33,483
My emergency frequency is 3-8.

524
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:37,571
Let me know as soon as you get the money.

525
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,574
I'll distract them

526
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:43,702
to help you come back in safely.

527
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:48,665
Didn't you tell me
to leave for another country?

528
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,043
And now you're making sure I come back?

529
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:54,254
To be honest,

530
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:57,174
I still hope

531
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,093
you'll stop being used like me…

532
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:04,264
and leave for another country

533
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:08,059
to live a happy life.

534
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:15,066
But you need to come back

535
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:18,111
for the hostages,

536
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,280
my comrades,

537
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,576
and my sister Su-hui to live.

538
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:29,164
Are you

539
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:32,209
scared that I might…

540
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:38,215
not come back?

541
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,015
Then give me…

542
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:52,103
a reason I must

543
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:55,524
come back.

544
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,362
For instance,

545
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:05,909
"If you come back with the money,

546
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:15,252
I will leave with you to another country."

547
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,633
Of course,
I'll be betraying my country then.

548
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:27,681
But if I can leave with you…

549
00:43:44,573 --> 00:43:46,866
Eun's wife is already moving.

550
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:52,914
You should get ready.

551
00:44:06,595 --> 00:44:07,887
Think carefully.

552
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,057
This is

553
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,812
the only way you'll live.

554
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,274
<i>Dr. Kang first!</i>

555
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,151
We must save Dr. Kang first, okay?

556
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,193
-Salute!
-Salute!

557
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:23,403
Understand, you bastard?

558
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:24,738
-Ma'am!
-What?

559
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:35,373
What are you doing here?

560
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:37,542
Are you insane?
Why'd you come here at this hour?

561
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:44,341
Ms. Hong told me to come here
without telling me why.

562
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,551
She practically threatened me

563
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:49,054
saying she'd run over
to the First Lady if I didn't.

564
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:52,265
What? Eun's wife really did that?

565
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:53,391
-Salute!
-Salute!

566
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,226
Mr. Nam.

567
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:10,867
Hello, ma'am!

568
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:23,171
Give us some privacy.

569
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,091
Get out, guys.

570
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:32,389
-Mr. An.
-Yes?

571
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:36,768
Do you have any beer here by any chance?
I'm quite thirsty.

572
00:46:07,382 --> 00:46:09,926
You should really know your place, woman!

573
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:14,097
If you want to be the leader of the wives,
you should do it properly!

574
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:19,561
So this is what they call
a bolt from the blue.

575
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:22,522
Ms. Hong, what the hell are you doing?

576
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,203
You heard my husband would become
the president if 13 people died.

577
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:39,414
So did you encourage your husband

578
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,708
to kill my husband?

579
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:45,587
What? Are you out of your mind?

580
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,339
Have you gone insane?

581
00:46:48,423 --> 00:46:49,382
My goodness.

582
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:53,428
Since your husband, who's aspiring

583
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:57,682
to become the president, is in critical
condition, you must've lost reason.

584
00:46:58,266 --> 00:46:59,642
Get it together

585
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,436
and go home, please.

586
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,863
So you're playing innocent?

587
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:14,657
As soon as I tell the First Lady,

588
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:17,076
everyone around you will be questioned

589
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,788
and evidence will turn up.

590
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:21,623
Will you be okay?

591
00:47:27,754 --> 00:47:29,672
Oh, my God.

592
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:34,052
Hey, do you call this
delusion or paranoia?

593
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:40,767
You betrayed your commander
who'd saved your life three times.

594
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,603
And joining in the President's coup,

595
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,064
the First Lady hates you for it.

596
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,403
God, it's come again.

597
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,156
Even though
my husband didn't join the coup,

598
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,451
he stayed loyal to his superior
until the end.

599
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:01,538
So the First Lady recommended him
to the President repeatedly.

600
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:03,832
You know that, right?

601
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,167
If she finds out

602
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,212
my husband was

603
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:11,130
in fact shot

604
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:14,759
by some vicious insider,
and not by the Northern spies,

605
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:17,720
how do you think
the First Lady will react?

606
00:48:19,138 --> 00:48:22,475
"Once a mongrel, always a mongrel"

607
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,602
is a philosophy she lives by.

608
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:29,440
Why don't you

609
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,486
go tell her if you have time for this?

610
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:36,114
For Code 1

611
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:40,493
and the First Lady, our party's winning
the election is the most important thing.

612
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:46,457
So that they can
keep playing at King and Queen.

613
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,043
That's right! Absolutely!

614
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,211
Of course.

615
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:53,381
The election is in seven days now.

616
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:56,968
You think they'll side with Eun,
who's useless?

617
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,887
Those people need me,

618
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,681
someone who'll wrap up
the election scheme successfully.

619
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:04,517
They need me! No matter what I've done!

620
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,563
Well done!

621
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:20,950
Do you think

622
00:49:21,034 --> 00:49:24,287
they'll keep you by their side
after the election?

623
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:28,666
Once it's over,
you'll end up like a mongrel

624
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,793
kicked out of a feast.

625
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:33,379
You wench! I'll kill you!

626
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:35,131
-No, honey!
-Oh, my God!

627
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:36,132
Ma'am.

628
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,216
-Let go of me!
-What?

629
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:47,644
You bastard!
How dare you call me after that?

630
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,479
<i>It's me. Please help me.</i>

631
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,150
What? Hey, what's going on? What happened?

632
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:56,402
Remember the sleep-inducing shot?

633
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:59,030
I stabbed the guy guarding me with it.

634
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:02,909
<i>The rest are all
in the prayer room to eat right now.</i>

635
00:50:02,992 --> 00:50:04,160
<i>What do I do?</i>

636
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:05,870
Get me out of here. Please!

637
00:50:05,954 --> 00:50:08,206
Of course! Listen.

638
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:11,042
Go to the washroom
in the basement right now.

639
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,251
There are windows there.

640
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:15,254
I'll send my guys there
to pick you up. Go now!

641
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:16,589
Okay. Hurry up.

642
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:17,924
I'm so scared.

643
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:20,760
I understand. Of course, you're scared.

644
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:24,931
We're heading there right now.
Hang in there.

645
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:26,099
<i>We'll be right over.</i>

646
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:31,062
Captain!

647
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:33,356
-Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

648
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:34,899
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir?

649
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:41,364
-Understood?
-Understood, sir.

650
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:44,075
Is someone escaping through the basement?

651
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:45,159
Honey!

652
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:47,954
I love you!

653
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:49,789
Go back home. Now!

654
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:51,374
Go now!

655
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,919
What's gotten into him?

656
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:58,381
Honey! Stay safe, okay?

657
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:05,805
Why did he do that here?
That's embarrassing.

658
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:32,123
Stay safe.

659
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:41,174
You too.

660
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,688
Good luck.

661
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:12,622
Promise me…

662
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,879
you'll leave with me if I come back.

663
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,316
I guess I must come back

664
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,443
to hear your answer.

665
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:10,721
Han-na, listen carefully.

666
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:14,475
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya of Hankuk Central
Medical Center is a Northern spy.

667
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:18,729
What?

668
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:23,109
Secretary-General Nam Tae-il's doctor
is a Northern spy?

669
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:25,862
I'm sure they're more than that.

670
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:28,865
<i>So you must find evidence of it.</i>

671
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:32,201
We need it to stop him
from blowing up the dorm.

672
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:36,330
Okay.

673
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:40,293
But… God, Kang acted
so nonchalantly all this time.

674
00:53:42,628 --> 00:53:43,880
And she will soon

675
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:48,926
get out of the dorm on the pretext of
intercepting the payment for the scheme.

676
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,096
Watch her every movement too.
You can't miss anything.

677
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,309
I'll watch them in bed together
if I have to, so don't worry.

678
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,259
-Careful.
-Damn it.

679
00:55:54,677 --> 00:55:56,178
Turn on the lights. There.

680
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:00,224
You're home!

681
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,227
I'm so relieved.

682
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:06,314
I'm not dreaming, am I?

683
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:10,860
Why don't you hit me?
Slap me. Here. Come on.

684
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:16,115
That hurts so much.

685
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:20,494
Do you know how much I resented you?

686
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:22,872
I know I told you to leave,

687
00:56:22,955 --> 00:56:25,875
but how could you run like that
when you saw the dynamite?

688
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,127
What do you mean, run?

689
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,046
I was scared they might blow you up.

690
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:33,883
I was so scared my gorgeous Cheong-ya
might be blown to pieces.

691
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:36,594
Although the President ordered me
to kill them all,

692
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:38,846
I chose to retreat to save you.

693
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,974
God, do you know how sad I was?

694
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:44,310
I realized I was the only one
who could save myself.

695
00:56:44,393 --> 00:56:46,562
So I decided to escape at all costs.

696
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:50,149
You did well. I've been thinking

697
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,778
how to get you out of there all this time.
Well done.

698
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:58,115
How could you let those spies
go wild like that?

699
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,410
Joining hands with the ANSP team leader

700
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:02,953
and shooting the ANSP director.

701
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:05,498
Those damn bastards.

702
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:09,168
How could they send such idiots
for the 300-million-dollar scheme?

703
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,463
They should've sent guys who would die
if their country told them to.

704
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:15,466
Instead, they sent
some soon-to-be traitor.

705
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:17,760
It must've been hard for you.

706
00:57:17,843 --> 00:57:19,345
You did well.

707
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,724
Wash me. I want to take a shower.

708
00:57:24,934 --> 00:57:28,312
Sure, sure. All right.
Let's go take a shower.

709
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:30,064
Let's go.

710
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,089
Dad…

711
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:10,271
Dad…

712
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:30,958
Please… Dad…

713
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:07,203
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

714
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:08,829
Help the less fortunate.

715
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:12,124
<i>I told you, the fortuneteller
promised to pick them out.</i>

716
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:16,295
But the money must be sent to the North
as soon as the election's over.

717
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:19,089
We still have as many as six days left.

718
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:23,677
You're number two in the ANSP now.

719
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,931
You can find out
companies' confidential information.

720
00:59:27,014 --> 00:59:31,018
If you use that much money,
you can even pull off a scam.

721
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,603
A scam?

722
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:35,564
You can make a 30% profit in a few days.

723
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:40,903
30% of 300 million dollars
is 90 million dollars.

724
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:42,154
With that much money,

725
00:59:42,238 --> 00:59:46,242
we can buy a hundred of
those popular apartments in Apgujeong.

726
00:59:47,868 --> 00:59:49,954
-A hundred?
-Yes!

727
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:52,498
If we snowball that money into a fortune,

728
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:55,793
who knows?
You might end up becoming the President.

729
00:59:58,629 --> 00:59:59,755
The President?

730
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:07,721
Now that Nam Tae-il
got rid of Director Eun,

731
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:11,725
if you take care of Nam, why not?
You have a chance.

732
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:15,229
And the weapon you need
to trample on him is money!

733
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:23,988
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

734
01:00:24,071 --> 01:00:25,573
Those bastards

735
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:27,533
even strapped bombs

736
01:00:27,616 --> 01:00:30,077
to Eun's daughter, all over her body--

737
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,454
Will you keep letting me down?

738
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:38,168
Sir, I should have told you this sooner.

739
01:00:38,252 --> 01:00:39,670
I apologize.

740
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,716
But the truth is, because Director Eun

741
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:45,843
failed to keep his man under control,

742
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:48,721
an agent named Gang-mu
has joined hands with the spies.

743
01:00:48,804 --> 01:00:52,933
On top of that, he has told the hostages
that this is the election scheme.

744
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:03,944
The only way to take care of all this
neatly is to blow up the dorm.

745
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:08,073
But Director Eun has been strongly
against it because of his daughter.

746
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,870
If you say yes,

747
01:01:12,953 --> 01:01:15,456
I will put an end to it at once.

748
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,934
Did you have breakfast? Eat with me.

749
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,688
I really appreciate it, sir!

750
01:02:14,014 --> 01:02:16,517
OCCUPATION: FORTUNETELLER
HOMETOWN: NORTH PYONGAN

751
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:48,716
How on earth…

752
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,176
Weren't you

753
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:54,638
being held hostage in the dorm?

754
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,731
I was instructed
to give you this urgently.

755
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:23,751
Mother…

756
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:28,297
Her lifetime wish is to see her son,
who parted ways with her during the war,

757
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,840
once again before she dies.

758
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:36,221
What do you need me to do?

759
01:03:53,238 --> 01:03:54,865
They're all useless.

760
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,868
But I've picked out just a few

761
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,538
based on the companies'
top-secret info my husband found out.

762
01:04:06,168 --> 01:04:08,921
You'll soon meet someone
who will come across the sea.

763
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,675
And that person is so precious that you
might not able to meet them ever again,

764
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:15,761
so you should never miss them.

765
01:04:15,844 --> 01:04:17,805
The deity told me
to make sure to tell you.

766
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:22,726
"So precious," you say?

767
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:25,813
That person will change your life

768
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:27,564
completely.

769
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:48,293
Ms. Kim!

770
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:50,754
-You're back, ma'am.
-Hi.

771
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:56,969
A person who's come across the sea…
It must mean a foreigner, right?

772
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:59,012
I guess so.

773
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:02,224
Right. What's that? A customer's come?

774
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:04,184
Yes. She's getting changed.

775
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:06,812
She's bought as many as three dresses
from your collection!

776
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:09,147
Oh, is that so?

777
01:05:21,076 --> 01:05:22,160
She's a foreigner.

778
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,340
Oh, my.

779
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,807
Isn't this company a private-equity firm

780
01:05:43,891 --> 01:05:46,560
based in Hong Kong?
One of the best, at that.

781
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,222
She said she came to Korea
to look for investors

782
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:25,933
for a private equity fund that she made.

783
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,393
She says the fund
deals with very large sums.

784
01:06:29,061 --> 01:06:30,896
I'm sure it is.

785
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:40,614
So only one spot's left?

786
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:54,795
She asked if you'd like to sign up
for the last spot left.

787
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,004
Oh, my.

788
01:06:56,922 --> 01:07:00,008
My goodness. Thank you so much.

789
01:07:00,092 --> 01:07:02,803
Of course, I should. Translate it now!

790
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:14,773
<i>Director Eun Chang-su, who was shot by
the armed spies around 7 p.m. yesterday,</i>

791
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:18,402
<i>underwent surgery
but is still unconscious.</i>

792
01:07:18,485 --> 01:07:21,738
<i>Dr. Song Hyeon-tak of Hankuk Central
Medical Center, who did the surgery,</i>

793
01:07:21,822 --> 01:07:24,449
<i>said they should watch him
closely for a few more day</i>

794
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:26,618
<i>to check on Mr. Eun's progress.</i>

795
01:08:09,244 --> 01:08:11,413
I did everything you told me to do.

796
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:15,500
And Dr. Song has announced
that you're in critical condition.

797
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:17,878
Nam Tae-il…

798
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:20,756
must not find out.

799
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:22,591
Of course.

800
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:26,261
I find Choi suspicious too,
so I'm keeping this from him.

801
01:08:29,431 --> 01:08:31,016
You were very lucky.

802
01:08:31,558 --> 01:08:33,643
He said only 13 people would die…

803
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:39,107
Honey, it really must mean
that you'll become the President.

804
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:42,402
Otherwise,
how did the bullet a sniper shot

805
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:44,905
just graze your ribs a little?

806
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,407
The deity kept you safe.

807
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:50,410
Now…

808
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:57,542
we must come up with a plan
to bury that bastard Tae-il alive.

809
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:08,386
<i>Damn, the short rib soup was amazing.</i>

810
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,138
Keep up the good work.

811
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,599
I've got to say,

812
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:15,811
she's a good luck charm.

813
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:18,563
As soon as she got out,
everything's going well.

814
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,398
Wait.

815
01:09:20,482 --> 01:09:24,277
I wonder what my little pretty thing's
doing. Hey, give me the phone.

816
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,491
My God.

817
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,244
Hello?

818
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:34,121
Hello?

819
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:40,127
Just when I was about to call you!

820
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,672
When the hostage situation's over,
how about we go on a trip?

821
01:09:43,755 --> 01:09:46,341
<i>Just the two of us, let's go some place</i>

822
01:09:46,424 --> 01:09:49,386
where no one knows us.
I want to go around holding your hand.

823
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,388
How about the Maldives?

824
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,766
You precious little fox.

825
01:09:55,517 --> 01:09:56,768
Sure.

826
01:09:56,852 --> 01:09:59,187
Let's go at the end of the year.
Book tickets.

827
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:01,439
Really? You really mean it?

828
01:10:02,524 --> 01:10:04,276
Tell me your passport number then.

829
01:10:05,777 --> 01:10:06,611
Okay.

830
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,867
Got it. I'll book the tickets.

831
01:10:13,451 --> 01:10:15,662
I know. Me too.

832
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:27,465
Is this the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank?

833
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:31,178
I'd like to open a secret account.

834
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:36,016
Kang Cheong-ya just called
the Tokyo branch of Swiss BR Bank,

835
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,727
<i>lying that she's the wife
of Secretary-General Nam Tae-il.</i>

836
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,024
As soon as she told them Nam's passport
number, they said they'd send their staff.

837
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,527
Swiss BR Bank? Is she planning to flee
after opening the secret account?

838
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:53,366
If she goes to the airport or
tries to stow away, arrest her right away.

839
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:55,160
Arrest her?

840
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:57,787
Me, who's being chased by the agency?

841
01:10:59,873 --> 01:11:02,083
Even if I arrest her,
I have nowhere to hand her over.

842
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:03,919
Who said anything about the agency?

843
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:07,839
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

844
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,842
That's the only way to save the hostages

845
01:11:11,509 --> 01:11:14,095
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

846
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:40,205
<i>I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't</i>

847
01:11:40,288 --> 01:11:42,332
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

848
01:11:42,415 --> 01:11:44,167
So trust me and be patient.

849
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,919
<i>That's great!</i>

850
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,004
Them blowing themselves up?
That's way better.

851
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:50,632
<i>What if Kang makes off
with 300 million dollars?</i>

852
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:52,842
<i>Just trust her and wait for her?</i>

853
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:54,344
<i>Once she has that much money,</i>

854
01:11:54,427 --> 01:11:56,429
<i>she might flee to another country.</i>

855
01:11:58,265 --> 01:12:00,767
<i>I'll help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.</i>

856
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:06,898
Your father is the ANSP director?

857
01:12:06,982 --> 01:12:09,401
<i>Isn't he the one trying to kill us all?</i>

858
01:12:09,484 --> 01:12:11,444
<i>Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?</i>

859
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,405
<i>That's so creepy!</i>

860
01:12:13,488 --> 01:12:16,574
I want to help you get out alive.

861
01:12:16,658 --> 01:12:19,369
<i>I'll get in the same car as Soo-ho.</i>

862
01:12:19,995 --> 01:12:21,413
<i>I'm sorry I've put you</i>

863
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:23,999
<i>through all this.</i>

864
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:26,876
<i>Soo-ho.</i>

865
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:30,505
I'll stay by your side until the end.

866
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:37,345
BONUS

867
01:12:40,265 --> 01:12:44,894
You're Linda Young, a fund manager
at ABK Partners based in Hong Kong.

868
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:47,564
And you're flying to the New York HQ
tomorrow morning

869
01:12:47,647 --> 01:12:49,441
to have a conference meeting.

870
01:12:49,524 --> 01:12:51,693
I'm Gong Gil-sun,

871
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:54,779
who used to scam US soldiers in Osaka.

872
01:12:54,863 --> 01:12:57,824
I'm the Gong Gil-sun.
Don't you know my nickname?

873
01:12:57,907 --> 01:13:00,243
Of course I do. "Threatening Gong."
