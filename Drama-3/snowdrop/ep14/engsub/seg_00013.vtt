01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:31.821 line:85.83%,end
What should I do?

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:36.117 line:85.83%,end
Hong Ae-ra? Maybe she's pulling tricks
to catch Cheong-ya.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.119 line:85.83%,end
The director's still unconscious,

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:40.538 line:85.83%,end
so I doubt she's interested
in catching Cheong-ya.

01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:42.289 line:85.83%,end
I mean, she's not Nam Tae-il's wife.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.708 line:85.83%,end
But it might be dangerous.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.501 line:85.83%,end
You're wanted now.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:51.173 line:85.83%,end
If Lim Soo-ho doesn't blow himself up,
Nam will

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:53.592 line:85.83%,end
set off the bombs for sure.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.345 line:85.83%,end
Time's running out,
so we must do everything we can.

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:58.139 line:85.83%,end
All right.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:30.504 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.428 line:85.83%,end
You're the one

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:43.017 line:85.83%,end
who brought the recording tape
inside the dorm, aren't you?

01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:48.272 line:85.83%,end
You did it to save the students,

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.568 line:85.83%,end
so I won't punish you for it.

01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:55.654 line:85.83%,end
I…

01:07:57.364 --> 01:07:58.824 line:85.83%,end
must…

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.915 line:85.83%,end
save my daughter.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:12.505 line:85.83%,end
The North told Soo-ho
that they'll kill his sister

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.466 line:85.83%,end
if he doesn't blow himself
and the hostages up by midnight.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:18.761 line:85.83%,end
So we must rescue the hostages
before midnight.

01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:22.807 line:85.83%,end
I need to talk to Lim Soo-ho.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.391 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is Taedong River.</i>

01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:28.312 line:85.83%,end
Moran Hill, do you copy?
This is Taedong River.

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:31.649 line:85.83%,end
She turned off her radio.
I'm sure she backed out!

01:08:34.485 --> 01:08:35.653 line:85.83%,end
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:38.697 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I'm here.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.664 line:85.83%,end
Gang-mu.

01:08:47.498 --> 01:08:49.333 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is Eun Chang-su.</i>

01:08:57.842 --> 01:08:59.510 line:85.83%,end
I heard you were in critical condition.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.388 line:85.83%,end
Was it fake news again?

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.227 line:85.83%,end
Is Lim Soo-ho with you?

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.281 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.326 line:85.83%,end
I want to help you.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:30.416 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you release all the hostages
including my daughter,</i>

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:34.170 line:85.83%,end
I'll have a car ready

01:09:34.753 --> 01:09:36.630 line:85.83%,end
in Mount Ogong

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.466 line:85.83%,end
for you guys to escape.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.095 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll do everything in my power</i>

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.848 line:85.83%,end
<i>for you to flee</i>

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.434 line:85.83%,end
<i>to another country safely.</i>

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.229 line:85.83%,end
<i>After everyone gets out,</i>

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:54.940 line:85.83%,end
I'll blow the dorm up

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.610 line:85.83%,end
and tell the press

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.613 line:85.83%,end
<i>the spies have blown themselves up.</i>

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:03.532 line:85.83%,end
<i>And I'll inform the North</i>

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.076 line:85.83%,end
that you're dead.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.496 line:85.83%,end
Then your sister

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.125 line:85.83%,end
<i>will be safe.</i>

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:16.712 line:85.83%,end
The students know

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:20.591 line:85.83%,end
about the election scheme,
but you want us to release them?

01:10:21.258 --> 01:10:23.928 line:85.83%,end
Can you guarantee the students' safety?

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.431 line:85.83%,end
I'll have it broadcast live

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:31.310 line:85.83%,end
and let them return to their parents
in the campus.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:34.271 line:85.83%,end
Won't it be enough?

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.941 line:85.83%,end
<i>And I'll release Reporter Gal</i>

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.110 line:85.83%,end
<i>and have him cover it.</i>

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:41.946 line:85.83%,end
How about

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:47.243 line:85.83%,end
you tell the press yourself that
this is all part of the election scheme?

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:52.915 line:85.83%,end
<i>That won't save
Soo-ho's sister in the North.</i>

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:56.001 line:85.83%,end
<i>I must stay in power</i>

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.587 line:85.83%,end
to send you guys

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:01.799 line:85.83%,end
<i>to another country safely.</i>

01:11:20.317 --> 01:11:21.819 line:85.83%,end
I'll think about it.

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:33.330 line:85.83%,end
The students know about the election
scheme. If they're released,
