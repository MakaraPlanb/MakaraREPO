01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.875 line:85.83%,end
the ruling party might lose the election,

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.670 line:85.83%,end
and you're likely to be put in danger.

01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:43.841 line:85.83%,end
I know it's great to have power,

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:49.346 line:85.83%,end
but I'll never
trade my child's life for it.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.354 line:85.83%,end
No one,

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.024 line:85.83%,end
including Nam and An, can find out

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.151 line:85.83%,end
that he has awoken.

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:07.072 line:85.83%,end
I understand. Don't worry.

01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:24.048 line:85.83%,end
He must know Nam Tae-il's the one
who ordered to shoot him.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:29.345 line:85.83%,end
But he's giving up power
so easily like this?

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:31.889 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.768 line:85.83%,end
The ruling party's winning right now.
He can't be giving up.

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:41.523 line:85.83%,end
If it's broadcast live
and the parents wait for him,

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.194 line:85.83%,end
the students will be safe.

01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:50.282 line:85.83%,end
But you were ordered
to kill the hostages too.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:55.496 line:85.83%,end
If it's broadcast live, the North will
watch it too. Will it be okay?

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.459 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure the North's aware
Comrade Kang's cover's been blown,

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.503 line:85.83%,end
so I don't think it'll matter.

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:06.090 line:85.83%,end
I still have a bad feeling about this.
They might be

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.301 line:85.83%,end
setting a trap to save Yeong-ro only.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.643 line:85.83%,end
If my dad is planning to rescue only me,

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:20.771 line:85.83%,end
there's a way to stop it.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.819 line:85.83%,end
Let me talk to my dad.

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:35.202 line:85.83%,end
What did you say?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.789 line:85.83%,end
<i>After all the hostages have been released,</i>

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.336 line:85.83%,end
I'll get in the car with Soo-ho.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.507 line:85.83%,end
Until he's left the country safely,

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.136 line:85.83%,end
<i>I will stay by his side.</i>

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:55.848 line:85.83%,end
You can't trust me

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.475 line:85.83%,end
that much?

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.145 line:85.83%,end
<i>I will</i>

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.814 line:85.83%,end
do everything in my power

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:07.860 line:85.83%,end
to save Soo-ho's life.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:14.658 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, Dad. But I need to see
Soo-ho leaving the country safely

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.411 line:85.83%,end
with my own eyes.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:28.964 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.843 line:85.83%,end
Get in the car with him.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:37.222 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll let you see him leaving safely</i>

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:39.600 line:85.83%,end
with your own eyes.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.699 line:85.83%,end
She wants to stay with him
until he leaves.

01:14:57.075 --> 01:15:00.537 line:85.83%,end
So you follow them and bring my daughter

01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:03.499 line:85.83%,end
back to me safely.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.959 line:85.83%,end
I will, sir.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.045 line:85.83%,end
Go to the dorm

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.797 line:85.83%,end
right now.

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:14.259 line:85.83%,end
I'll radio you as soon as it's ready.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.428 line:85.83%,end
So go stand by.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.096 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:34.738 line:85.83%,end
What a fool she is.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:40.744 line:85.83%,end
Why on earth is she taking the side
of those commies who killed her brother?

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:47.834 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:52.172 line:85.83%,end
You're at the most important crossroads
of your life right now.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:56.510 line:85.83%,end
If Yeong-ro's acting like this,
we won't be able to get her out.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:16:00.514 line:85.83%,end
And if you try to fool them
and anything goes wrong because of her,

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.307 line:85.83%,end
your life will be ruined

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.018 line:85.83%,end
as well as Yeong-ung's.

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.647 line:85.83%,end
You think it'll be okay

01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:11.984 line:85.83%,end
if you work with their parents
to keep their mouths shut?

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.069 line:85.83%,end
Of course,

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:17.573 line:85.83%,end
some sensible parents
will keep their children quiet,

01:16:18.198 --> 01:16:19.533 line:85.83%,end
but who knows?

01:16:19.616 --> 01:16:23.078 line:85.83%,end
There are always troublemakers
like Reporter Gal.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:28.208 line:85.83%,end
To be honest, I'm worried about Gal too.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:31.712 line:85.83%,end
You must think
you can keep him under control

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:33.714 line:85.83%,end
by threatening to kill his mother.
