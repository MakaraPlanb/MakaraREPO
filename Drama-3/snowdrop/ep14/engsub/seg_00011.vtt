00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:28.510 line:85.83%,end
Come on. Open up.

00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:36.810 line:85.83%,end
Mom.

00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:43.775 line:85.83%,end
Come on, you must be hungry. Eat it.

00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:45.985 line:85.83%,end
Open up.

00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:06.756 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.980 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:57:23.815 --> 00:57:25.024 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:29.737 line:85.83%,end
went out to intercept the money
they're going to send the North,

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.907 line:85.83%,end
and the ANSP found out about her.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.869 line:85.83%,end
Is that really true?

00:57:37.162 --> 00:57:39.164 line:85.83%,end
She's one of Lim Ji-rok's people.

00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:42.584 line:85.83%,end
Even if I tell him about this,

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:46.212 line:85.83%,end
he'll try to cover up her betrayal.

00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:49.507 line:85.83%,end
I don't care what happens to traitors.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:54.220 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang went out
to intercept the money to save us

00:57:54.929 --> 00:57:56.556 line:85.83%,end
when our country abandoned us.

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.434 line:85.83%,end
With that money,

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:03.062 line:85.83%,end
we might be able
to cut a deal with Lim Ji-rok.

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.989 line:85.83%,end
Your superior…

00:58:15.241 --> 00:58:17.368 line:85.83%,end
must be rivals with Lim Ji-rok.

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:20.163 line:85.83%,end
We must inform your superior of this

00:58:20.705 --> 00:58:22.332 line:85.83%,end
to get Lim Ji-rok.

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.468 line:85.83%,end
You've got some nerve.

00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:38.473 line:85.83%,end
You want to take down the head of the UFD
when you're surrounded by enemies?

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.188 line:85.83%,end
Lim Ji-rok told me

00:58:47.148 --> 00:58:49.108 line:85.83%,end
if we don't blow ourselves up by midnight…

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.738 line:85.83%,end
that he'd kill my sister.

00:58:54.822 --> 00:58:57.242 line:85.83%,end
I will never let him have his way.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.626 line:85.83%,end
It must be great
to have a powerful father.

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.716 line:85.83%,end
Are you sure you can kill him?

00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:21.766 line:85.83%,end
Gyeok-chan.

00:59:25.144 --> 00:59:26.563 line:85.83%,end
My father…

00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:32.277 line:85.83%,end
was a coal miner
in North Hamgyong Province.

00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:35.321 line:85.83%,end
And a mine roof collapse

00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:38.366 line:85.83%,end
killed him.

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:44.914 line:85.83%,end
I've been fighting
for our country and people,

00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:50.795 line:85.83%,end
not for those who consider
our agents' lives as expendable.

00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:57.468 line:85.83%,end
Lim Ji-rok has us cornered.
We must get him first

00:59:58.386 --> 01:00:00.138 line:85.83%,end
to find a way to survive.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.480 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure your superior will welcome…

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.319 line:85.83%,end
any intel that can bring Lim down.

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:26.956 line:85.83%,end
Untie me.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.991 line:85.83%,end
Moran Hill 1 intercepted the money

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.369 line:85.83%,end
the South was going to send us.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.412 line:85.83%,end
And the ANSP found out about her.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.708 line:85.83%,end
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: CHONGCHON RIVER

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.795 line:85.83%,end
"Kang Cheong-ya
would never betray the party"?

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:18.049 line:85.83%,end
As if your son was not enough,
Kang's screwing us over too?

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.469 line:85.83%,end
If we won't be able to get the money,

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:22.929 line:85.83%,end
it's all on you!
