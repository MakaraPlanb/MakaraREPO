00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:18.808 line:85.83%,end
Where the heck is it?

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.901 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am.

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.862 line:85.83%,end
Does the wiretapping room
still have power?

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:33.156 line:85.83%,end
This needs recharging.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.367 line:85.83%,end
Yes. I'll do it for you.

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:10.235 line:85.83%,end
So soon?

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:12.904 line:85.83%,end
But she went out only yesterday.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.531 line:85.83%,end
She did it in a day?

00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:16.700 line:85.83%,end
She even managed
to become Nam Tae-il's doctor.

00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:19.661 line:85.83%,end
She must have substantial intel.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:22.622 line:85.83%,end
She'll come back tonight. Han-na's
watching her, so let's wait and see.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.874 line:85.83%,end
But will she really come back?

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.460 line:85.83%,end
I mean, what's in it for her?

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.212 line:85.83%,end
I'm not sure.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:35.051 line:85.83%,end
I guess love is more important to her
than ideology or principles.

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:40.473 line:85.83%,end
Of course, love is more important
than ideology or principles.

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:47.314 line:85.83%,end
Whether you're a man or a woman,
that's the truth of life.

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.820 line:85.83%,end
If Kang Cheong-ya really comes back,

00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.742 line:85.83%,end
I should learn a lesson from her.

00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.049 line:85.83%,end
<i>Comes back?</i>

00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:18.887 line:85.83%,end
<i>Wait a second.
Did Kang Cheong-ya get out of the dorm?</i>

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:02.222 line:85.83%,end
A charger must be somewhere in here.

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:19.989 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.193 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.738 line:85.83%,end
<i>Who is this?</i>

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.614 line:85.83%,end
The telephone operator?

00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:03.992 line:85.83%,end
Yes. This is Gye Bun-ok.

00:29:04.784 --> 00:29:06.786 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro and I are really close.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.622 line:85.83%,end
I can help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.085 line:85.83%,end
Watch what you say.
Who said we'd only get her out?

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:15.795 line:85.83%,end
Stop talking nonsense and turn it off.

00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:17.505 line:85.83%,end
Wait!

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:21.009 line:85.83%,end
You'll be promoted
if you catch the Northern spy, right?

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:22.802 line:85.83%,end
Do you want my help?

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:28.433 line:85.83%,end
You can help me catch Lim Soo-ho?
How will you do that?

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:32.061 line:85.83%,end
Well, I will give you
very useful information.

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:34.981 line:85.83%,end
In return, you must help me later.

00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:42.822 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
of Hankuk Central Medical Center

00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:45.033 line:85.83%,end
is a Northern spy.

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:56.002 line:85.83%,end
What did you just say?
Kang Cheong-ya is what?

00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:58.129 line:85.83%,end
She is a Northern spy!

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:01.132 line:85.83%,end
<i>She must be out of the dorm right now--</i>

00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:05.512 line:85.83%,end
Hello? Hey!

00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:07.555 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.
