00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.600 line:85.83%,end
No, that's not it.
My grandma does run a rice cake shop.

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:39.437 line:85.83%,end
Isn't the ANSP director
the one trying to kill us all?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.522 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:42.731 line:85.83%,end
That's so creepy!

00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:46.193 line:85.83%,end
This must be why she didn't tell you.
Don't you think?

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.654 line:85.83%,end
Are you taking her side
since you're an ANSP spy?

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:51.198 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro.

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.535 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully.

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:58.539 line:85.83%,end
My brother used to weigh 78kg,

00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:01.625 line:85.83%,end
but after a month
of being locked up in the ANSP,

00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:03.669 line:85.83%,end
he's now 50kg.

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.548 line:85.83%,end
He was so ashamed that he'd given in

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.592 line:85.83%,end
that he blamed himself

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:13.137 line:85.83%,end
and went insane in the end.

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:17.099 line:85.83%,end
The head of those
who strive to torture innocent people

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.435 line:85.83%,end
is her father?

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.604 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.149 line:85.83%,end
The one who gives them incentives

00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:28.444 line:85.83%,end
to encourage them to dedicate themselves

00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:31.363 line:85.83%,end
to their country and people

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.949 line:85.83%,end
must be her dad.

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:39.663 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:43.083 line:85.83%,end
Your dad's trying to kill us all
even when you're in here?

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:44.752 line:85.83%,end
Of course not.

00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:47.379 line:85.83%,end
He must be trying
to save only his daughter.

00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:50.341 line:85.83%,end
He's the powerful ANSP director after all.

00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:52.343 line:85.83%,end
That's obvious.

00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:07.608 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro.

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:09.777 line:85.83%,end
Don't you

00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:12.571 line:85.83%,end
ever come into our room.

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.701 line:85.83%,end
Let's go, girls.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.295 line:85.83%,end
-And she gets a scholarship?
-She's really something.

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:30.965 line:85.83%,end
-She's really scary.
-What an amazing dad you've got.

00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:33.551 line:85.83%,end
How could you lie about such--

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:35.344 line:85.83%,end
What's the use of talking to such a liar?

00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:37.096 line:85.83%,end
I'm disappointed, Yeong-ro.

00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:42.518 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro. I can't believe that's true.

00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:47.815 line:85.83%,end
There's no one to trust in this world.

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.277 line:85.83%,end
She's so creepy.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.198 line:85.83%,end
I really thought

00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:59.660 line:85.83%,end
you were a nice person.
How could you fool us all this time?

00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:13.382 line:85.83%,end
How could youâ€¦

00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:19.138 line:85.83%,end
How could you lie to me too?

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.266 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui.

00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:13.233 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.868 line:85.83%,end
I'mâ€¦ I'm fine.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.789 line:85.83%,end
It's true I've kept it from them
that I'm the ANSP director's daughter.

00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:30.542 line:85.83%,end
And it's true that my dad did bad things.

00:44:32.711 --> 00:44:36.256 line:85.83%,end
They're just on edge
with all they've been going through.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.217 line:85.83%,end
They will understand you

00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:40.636 line:85.83%,end
someday.

00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:43.639 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.
