00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.227 line:85.83%,end
Is something

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:05.730 line:85.83%,end
wrong?

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.235 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.738 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.835 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry I've put you

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.880 line:85.83%,end
through all this.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.432 line:85.83%,end
If you hadn't met me,

00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:46.062 line:85.83%,end
you wouldn't be suffering all this pain.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.151 line:85.83%,end
But you are…

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.572 line:85.83%,end
not doing this by choice.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.494 line:85.83%,end
If…

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:06.207 line:85.83%,end
If you and I were

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:08.751 line:85.83%,end
just ordinary people,

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.463 line:85.83%,end
what would it have been like?

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.578 line:85.83%,end
I probably…

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.211 line:85.83%,end
would be singing at some music cafe.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:02.179 line:85.83%,end
Singing?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.226 line:85.83%,end
I wanted…

00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:11.731 line:85.83%,end
to become a musician like my dad.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.526 line:85.83%,end
Even after we were
kicked out to the coal town,

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.488 line:85.83%,end
he would make songs

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.576 line:85.83%,end
about flowers, wind, and love
and sing them to us.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:29.582 line:85.83%,end
Su-hui and I would sing along.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.925 line:85.83%,end
And I think that's what kept us smiling…

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.721 line:85.83%,end
even in that cold, barren place.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:48.517 line:85.83%,end
So I also…

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.147 line:85.83%,end
want to live

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.568 line:85.83%,end
singing such songs to the people I love.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.000 line:85.83%,end
If…

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.837 line:85.83%,end
you sing at a music cafe,

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:22.134 line:85.83%,end
I'll go to that cafe every day…

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.388 line:85.83%,end
Every single day,

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.308 line:85.83%,end
whether it rains or snows.

00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:49.161 line:85.83%,end
I'd love to hear

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:51.872 line:85.83%,end
you sing.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.599 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's a shame
what happened to Director Eun.</i>

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:15.145 line:85.83%,end
But technically, your agent persuaded
my agent to betray us.

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:17.189 line:85.83%,end
Your side is also to blame.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.692 line:85.83%,end
Look, Comrade Deputy Director.

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:21.068 line:85.83%,end
Are you serious?

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:24.405 line:85.83%,end
Your guy shot our ANSP director,
for God's sake!

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.782 line:85.83%,end
This scheme is worth 300 million dollars,

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.951 line:85.83%,end
but you sent some soon-to-be traitor!

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.453 line:85.83%,end
And you blame us? Are you kidding me?

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:35.165 line:85.83%,end
The hostage situation can't drag on
any longer, so we took special measures.

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:38.836 line:85.83%,end
I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.130 line:85.83%,end
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.965 line:85.83%,end
So trust me and be patient.

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:45.634 line:85.83%,end
By midnight today?

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.222 line:85.83%,end
He may not the most loyal soldier,

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.975 line:85.83%,end
but he's extremely devoted to his sister.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.685 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure he'll blow himself up.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.438 line:85.83%,end
So as soon as he does,

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.982 line:85.83%,end
wire the 300 million dollars as promised.
