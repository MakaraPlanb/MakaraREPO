00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.532 line:85.83%,end
I'm really fine.

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.830 line:85.83%,end
<i>I doubt it was someone in the dorm
that ratted on me.</i>

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:04.256 line:85.83%,end
After ratting on me,

00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:07.384 line:85.83%,end
you helped me escape.

00:48:10.345 --> 00:48:11.763 line:85.83%,end
What are you trying to pull?

00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.981 line:85.83%,end
Look, doctor.

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:23.984 line:85.83%,end
You must go back
into the dorm for Gang-mu to live.

00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:26.320 line:85.83%,end
Why would I rat on you?

00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.331 line:85.83%,end
The North told Soo-ho
they'd kill his sister if he doesn't

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.917 line:85.83%,end
blow up the hostages and himself
by midnight.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.252 line:85.83%,end
So you must get back in!

00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:47.633 line:85.83%,end
So you should've done as I said.

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:50.093 line:85.83%,end
I warned you to stop keeping an eye on me.

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:53.138 line:85.83%,end
And the ANSP raided my hideout
now of all times?

00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:55.265 line:85.83%,end
Wow.

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:58.477 line:85.83%,end
This is what I get for saving you?

00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:01.355 line:85.83%,end
You didn't get caught, did you?

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.713 line:85.83%,end
This is Charmant.

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:31.468 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am. It's your husband.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.723 line:85.83%,end
God, he's such a coward.
I'm getting tired of this.

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.934 line:85.83%,end
How many times has he been calling me?

00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.313 line:85.83%,end
What is it this time?

00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.357 line:85.83%,end
What's the relationship
between you and Cheong-ya?

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.150 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell is Cheong-ya?

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.778 line:85.83%,end
You know, Nam Tae-il's doctor.

00:49:50.028 --> 00:49:52.197 line:85.83%,end
The one that's being held hostage
in the dorm.

00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.783 line:85.83%,end
<i>She had photos of you.</i>

00:49:54.866 --> 00:49:56.243 line:85.83%,end
Don't be surprised.

00:49:57.327 --> 00:50:01.123 line:85.83%,end
It turns out, she's a Northern spy.

00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:03.083 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang is?

00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.419 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness.

00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.505 line:85.83%,end
Are you serious? Is it really true?

00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:10.382 line:85.83%,end
Hello.

00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:11.925 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm serious.</i>

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:15.137 line:85.83%,end
<i>You really have
nothing to do with her, right?</i>

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.931 line:85.83%,end
She even kept watch on you and me.

00:50:18.974 --> 00:50:21.643 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my God. She's kept watch on me?

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.438 line:85.83%,end
Well, Iâ€¦

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:27.232 line:85.83%,end
Playing mahjong with her
a few times is all.

00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:30.402 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry a thing, honey.

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:32.988 line:85.83%,end
Yes, that's all.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:38.910 line:85.83%,end
By the way, our Mr. Nam

00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:41.955 line:85.83%,end
must be in trouble now.

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:43.331 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:47.502 line:85.83%,end
Go easy on him, honey. Okay?

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.046 line:85.83%,end
Go easy on him.

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.547 line:85.83%,end
Bye.

00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:58.597 line:85.83%,end
What's going on? He's in trouble?

00:50:59.806 --> 00:51:01.808 line:85.83%,end
Did something happen to my husband?

00:51:03.518 --> 00:51:04.853 line:85.83%,end
Goodness.

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.108 line:85.83%,end
It's about Dr. Kang.

00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:14.863 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam's doctor.

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:20.911 line:85.83%,end
It turns out,

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.371 line:85.83%,end
she's a Northern spy.
