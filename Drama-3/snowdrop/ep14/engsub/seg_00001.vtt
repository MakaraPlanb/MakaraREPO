She might flee to another country with it.

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:03.928 line:85.83%,end
No,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.265 line:85.83%,end
she might talk Nam Tae-il
into killing us all

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.684 line:85.83%,end
and manage to keep her identity hidden.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:14.063 line:85.83%,end
So if she finds out
we're tailing and watching her,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.983 line:85.83%,end
how do you think she'll react?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.903 line:85.83%,end
What you're doing

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.531 line:85.83%,end
is the same as forcing her

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.867 line:85.83%,end
to betray us. Okay?

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:43.760 line:85.83%,end
Now, I have no choiceâ€¦

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.431 line:85.83%,end
but to trust and wait for Comrade Kang.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:56.898 line:85.83%,end
I have no other choice.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.017 line:85.83%,end
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

Once the meeting with Choi Mi-hye is over,
someone from Swiss BR Bank will come.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:52.370 line:85.83%,end
Your job is to go to the bank with them
and wire the money to the paper company.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:53.496 line:85.83%,end
Got it.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.630 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you tell them
not to clean the room until checkout?

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:03.798 line:85.83%,end
I did.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.751 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.254 line:85.83%,end
If I pray,

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.382 line:85.83%,end
will it be answered?
