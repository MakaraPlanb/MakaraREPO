<i>This is why I told you to arrest Han-na!</i>

00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:37.260 line:85.83%,end
Put Cheong-ya on the no-fly list
and put out an APB on her. Han-na, too.

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:39.720 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.780 line:85.83%,end
We found this.

00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:58.865 line:85.83%,end
What is it?

00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:05.371 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:29.770 line:85.83%,end
What on earth are they up to?

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.648 line:85.83%,end
They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die.

00:36:57.506 --> 00:36:58.925 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP director's daughter?

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.642 line:85.83%,end
What does that mean?

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.103 line:85.83%,end
"They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die"?

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.859 line:85.83%,end
No, it's nothing.

00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.112 line:85.83%,end
You damn wench.

00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:21.989 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:24.617 line:85.83%,end
Are you still looking down on me?

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:28.663 line:85.83%,end
There's no commie to save you in here.

00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.709 line:85.83%,end
Talk while I'm asking nicely.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.378 line:85.83%,end
Now.

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.633 line:85.83%,end
The truth is…

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:58.567 line:85.83%,end
Gosh,

00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:00.486 line:85.83%,end
the song's really great.

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:02.280 line:85.83%,end
How holy.

00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:10.037 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.623 line:85.83%,end
Wake up, sir!

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:16.168 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP director's daughter is in here.

00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:20.589 line:85.83%,end
Why the hell are you not using
that amazing card?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.052 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:27.930 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP director's daughter is in here?

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.480 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:40.359 line:85.83%,end
you could use the daughter
and demand a bus or something.

00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.154 line:85.83%,end
Why are you not using her
to get out of here?

00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:46.198 line:85.83%,end
So who is it?
Who's the ANSP director's daughter?

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.451 line:85.83%,end
No way, that's impossible.

00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:50.911 line:85.83%,end
Why would the ANSP director's daughter
live in a dorm?

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:54.707 line:85.83%,end
Well, the hall director must know
if that's true.

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:02.840 line:85.83%,end
What…

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:04.508 line:85.83%,end
Well,

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.762 line:85.83%,end
speak of the devil.

00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.269 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.067 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:23.694 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:30.326 line:85.83%,end
Your father is the ANSP director?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.083 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:40.294 line:85.83%,end
Guys, that can't be true.
You know her father runs a rice cake shop.

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:43.255 line:85.83%,end
-She gave out rice cakes, remember?
-Hey!

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.673 line:85.83%,end
You be quiet.

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.094 line:85.83%,end
I asked her. You better tell the truth.

00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:50.221 line:85.83%,end
Is your father the ANSP director?

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.188 line:85.83%,end
It must be true.

00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:01.190 line:85.83%,end
The director's name is Eun Chang-su.

00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:04.068 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro's the only one in here
whose family name

00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:05.569 line:85.83%,end
is Eun.

00:40:06.695 --> 00:40:07.738 line:85.83%,end
No way.

00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:10.533 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.536 line:85.83%,end
Is it…

00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.163 line:85.83%,end
Is it really true?

00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:26.132 line:85.83%,end
Jeong-min, I'm sorry.

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:28.342 line:85.83%,end
I didn't mean to lie to you--

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:33.013 line:85.83%,end
Did you tell us your parents ran
a rice cake shop to keep it from us?
