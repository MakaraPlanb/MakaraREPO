01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.772 line:85.83%,end
Instruct Chongchon River
to kill Lim Soo-ho right away!

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.833 line:85.83%,end
That damn wench.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.461 line:85.83%,end
Shredding her body to pieces
wouldn't be enough.

01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:59.882 line:85.83%,end
How dare she fool me all this time
and seduce my husband!

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:02.468 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.804 line:85.83%,end
he had no idea.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:07.432 line:85.83%,end
How could he have known
he was a Northern spy?

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.434 line:85.83%,end
Even I was completely fooled!

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:15.273 line:85.83%,end
Whether he knew or not,
he violated the National Security Law.

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:18.526 line:85.83%,end
No, that's wrong. That's just wrong!

01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:22.572 line:85.83%,end
The one who lied is to blame.
Not the one who was fooled.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.283 line:85.83%,end
That fortuneteller…

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:28.161 line:85.83%,end
He must be a charlatan!

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.455 line:85.83%,end
He said I should

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:34.876 line:85.83%,end
have her stay by my husband's side
like a talisman!

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:37.170 line:85.83%,end
For him to live a long, healthy life

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.756 line:85.83%,end
and make his dreams come true!

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:46.012 line:85.83%,end
Why are you blaming the fortuneteller?

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:48.264 line:85.83%,end
He's a really good fortuneteller.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:56.522 line:85.83%,end
You know what? I knew something was off

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:59.901 line:85.83%,end
when he told Ms. Hong
exactly 13 people would die.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:04.697 line:85.83%,end
I mean, he's still unconscious in bed.
How is he going to become the President?

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.201 line:85.83%,end
He must be a charlatan.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.869 line:85.83%,end
A charlatan!

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:15.124 line:85.83%,end
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.169 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Please check the number and try again.</i>
-Not in service?

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:24.592 line:85.83%,end
Wait a second. Isn't it 041-387-1234?

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:27.345 line:85.83%,end
You must've dialed the wrong number.
Give it.

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:28.679 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:37.355 line:85.83%,end
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

01:03:37.438 --> 01:03:39.774 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Please check the number…</i>
-What?

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:42.610 line:85.83%,end
This is weird. It can't be.

01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:44.946 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.206 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Kim!

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:57.667 line:85.83%,end
Yes, ma'am?

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.377 line:85.83%,end
Call Hong Kong.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.797 line:85.83%,end
Ask them for Linda's number
in New York. Now.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.756 line:85.83%,end
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.426 line:85.83%,end
Do it here! Right now!

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.971 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.
What's with Hong Kong and New York?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.795 line:85.83%,end
What? Why did they hang up like that?

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:46.173 line:85.83%,end
I even signed the certificate
for the fund. What is wrong?

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:49.051 line:85.83%,end
Well, they said
Linda Young's never been to Seoul.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.636 line:85.83%,end
They even yelled at me.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.681 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean, she's never been here?

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:57.727 line:85.83%,end
She even gave me this 5-carat diamond.

01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.312 line:85.83%,end
As a token of their appreciation

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:03.608 line:85.83%,end
since I became a VVIP
at ABK Partners! But what?

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:06.861 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my God.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.946 line:85.83%,end
Five carats?

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.948 line:85.83%,end
Let me see.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.200 line:85.83%,end
We can easily tell if it's real

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.536 line:85.83%,end
by watching the condensation evaporate.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.331 line:85.83%,end
The condensation on a diamond
evaporates quickly.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.306 line:85.83%,end
It's fake.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.559 line:85.83%,end
It's just a cubic zirconia.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.202 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

01:05:57.161 --> 01:05:58.829 line:85.83%,end
Sir!

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.581 line:85.83%,end
Sir…

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:11.926 line:85.83%,end
What…

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:21.811 line:85.83%,end
What the hell is this? This can't be!

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:25.439 line:85.83%,end
Where the hell did he go?

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.191 line:85.83%,end
Where did he go?

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.528 line:85.83%,end
Hong Ae-ra wants to meet me.
