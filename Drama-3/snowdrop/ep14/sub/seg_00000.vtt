ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.525 line:14.17%,start
EPISODE 14

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:17.786 line:14.17%,start
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.635 line:14.17%,start
<i>Who said anything about the agency?</i>

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.097 line:14.17%,start
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.225 line:14.17%,start
That's the only way to save the hostages

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.353 line:14.17%,start
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:03.373 line:85.83%,end
Are all Southern bastards
backstabbing sly rats like you,

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.584 line:85.83%,end
just as I heard?

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.633 line:85.83%,end
Betrayal or not, I still have to do it.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.426 line:85.83%,end
I'm going to arrest you

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.428 line:85.83%,end
and make you defect.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:18.721 line:85.83%,end
Don't get ahead of yourself!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:24.435 line:85.83%,end
I only joined hands with you to survive.
That doesn't mean I've chosen the South.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.313 line:85.83%,end
But you can't go back anyway
since you're branded a traitor.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.273 line:85.83%,end
Iâ€¦

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.820 line:85.83%,end
Even if I want to, I can never defect
to the South because of Su-hui.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.532 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.534 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.661 line:85.83%,end
I really do.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.166 line:85.83%,end
So let's lower our guns.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.210 line:85.83%,end
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.754 line:85.83%,end
Don't you agree?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.405 line:85.83%,end
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:20.408 line:85.83%,end
We will blow up the dorm at midnight.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.329 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.958 line:85.83%,end
Make up some excuse
and kick the reporters out of the campus.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.544 line:85.83%,end
And make it look
like the commies blew themselves up.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.339 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.841 line:85.83%,end
But if we do that,

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.344 line:85.83%,end
the hostage situation will be over.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.971 line:85.83%,end
Should we pay the North right away?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:42.972 line:85.83%,end
Of course not!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.308 line:85.83%,end
They don't deserve to be paid early.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.852 line:85.83%,end
The payment's supposed to be made
after the election anyway.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.062 line:85.83%,end
Let's take our time.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.149 line:85.83%,end
Put it off as late as possible
to make them anxious.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.361 line:85.83%,end
-As late as possible to make them anxious.
-That's right.

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:05.578 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.499 line:85.83%,end
It's Choi, sir.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.670 line:85.83%,end
What is it?

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.756 line:85.83%,end
<i>Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon
of the MSS wants to talk to you, sir.</i>

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.842 line:85.83%,end
Choi Su-ryeon?

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.429 line:85.83%,end
<i>So just trust Kang Cheong-ya and wait?</i>

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.935 line:85.83%,end
With that huge amount of money,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.813 line:85.83%,end
she could live a new life
in any country in the world.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.357 line:85.83%,end
A luxurious life, at that.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.735 line:85.83%,end
But we just trust her
to come back to this bomb-rigged dorm?

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:40.321 line:85.83%,end
I mean, do you think

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.241 line:85.83%,end
she's an angel?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.368 line:85.83%,end
Or a saint?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.498 line:85.83%,end
Yes,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.667 line:85.83%,end
you're right.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.586 line:85.83%,end
I'm as anxious as you are.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.549 line:85.83%,end
It's hundreds of billions of won.
