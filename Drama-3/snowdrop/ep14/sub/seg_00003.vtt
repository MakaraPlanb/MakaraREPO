00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.124 line:85.83%,end
This is great!

00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:19.293 line:85.83%,end
Them blowing themselves up from inside?

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.629 line:85.83%,end
That'll make things a lot easier for us.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.297 line:85.83%,end
Absolutely, sir.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.925 line:85.83%,end
It seems everything's going smoothly.

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.802 line:85.83%,end
ANSP DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.096 line:85.83%,end
If this last one thing's taken care of,

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.516 line:85.83%,end
it'll really be all good.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.103 line:85.83%,end
What is it, sir?
Is there something bothering you?

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.442 line:85.83%,end
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.201 line:85.83%,end
VIP ROOM

00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:55.245 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do we do about Eun?</i>

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.706 line:85.83%,end
If he wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:01.210 line:85.83%,end
Because he must know who shot him.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.056 line:85.83%,end
Honey! No…

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:17.851 line:85.83%,end
You can't leave me behind like this.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:22.356 line:85.83%,end
Our Yeong-ung is only nine years old now.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.401 line:85.83%,end
And our dear Yeong-u

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:29.113 line:85.83%,end
was killed by those bastards too.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.615 line:85.83%,end
If you die too…

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:35.411 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:39.873 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam, it's Choi again.

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:44.753 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:45.796 line:85.83%,end
Tae-il.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:48.882 line:85.83%,end
You should turn on MBS News right now.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.759 line:85.83%,end
MBS News?

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:58.684 line:85.83%,end
<i>The longer he is in shock
due to excessive bleeding,</i>

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:01.937 line:85.83%,end
<i>the less likely he is to survive.</i>

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.689 line:85.83%,end
<i>So we can't</i>

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.734 line:85.83%,end
<i>be sure yet if he's going to make it.</i>

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.070 line:85.83%,end
That means he may not make it.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:13.782 line:85.83%,end
-My goodness. That's such a shame.
<i>-Honey, no!</i>

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.785 line:85.83%,end
<i>I don't think
we have to do anything to get rid of him.</i>

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.203 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.872 line:85.83%,end
Okay, I understand.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.876 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Honey!</i>
-Goodness.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.544 line:85.83%,end
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU
IN CRITICAL CONDITION

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:28.088 line:85.83%,end
-I feel so bad for him.
<i>-You can't die like this.</i>

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.299 line:85.83%,end
He's always put our country and people

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:33.469 line:85.83%,end
before his family, you know.

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.853 line:85.83%,end
The password is

00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:45.064 line:85.83%,end
your birthday.

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.860 line:85.83%,end
If anything goes wrong, I'm dead meat.
Literally. You know that, right?

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.196 line:85.83%,end
God, don't be such a coward.

00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:54.740 line:85.83%,end
You said you looked into it too.

00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:56.158 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:59.787 line:85.83%,end
There really is a fund manager
named Linda Young at ABK Partners.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.913 line:85.83%,end
See?

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:05.793 line:85.83%,end
She's the precious person my fortuneteller
told me about. He can't be wrong.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.170 line:85.83%,end
What about the company bankbook and seal?

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:13.342 line:85.83%,end
I opened it in a rush as you said, but
why do we need a corporate bank account?

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.511 line:85.83%,end
It's such a huge amount of money.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.387 line:85.83%,end
So we'll send the money abroad

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.099 line:85.83%,end
as if this corporate is investing
in the paper company.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.602 line:85.83%,end
Then the paper company will invest
the money in the private equity fund.

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:27.439 line:85.83%,end
This won't do. I'll go with you.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.526 line:85.83%,end
The Chief of the ANSP OPC
should be present so that they can't--

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.319 line:85.83%,end
You can't be serious!

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:37.491 line:85.83%,end
Do you want everyone to know
you're using the ANSP secret fund?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.993 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.540 line:85.83%,end
The company's
in the name of Ms. Kim, right?

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.292 line:85.83%,end
Of course. In the name of Kim Ye-ni.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:51.421 line:85.83%,end
I got to say,
you're as clever as Hannibal.

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.590 line:85.83%,end
It's like you knew this would happen

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:57.511 line:85.83%,end
and hired a Korean-American
as your secretary. You're amazing.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.930 line:85.83%,end
Stop saying silly things.

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.766 line:85.83%,end
Just a week.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.061 line:85.83%,end
In just a week,
we will make 90 million dollars.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.523 line:85.83%,end
That's 71.3 billion won!

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:13.652 line:85.83%,end
All you need to do is
buy me one week's time.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.237 line:85.83%,end
Okay?

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.488 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:21.785 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il told me to take my time
before sending the money.
