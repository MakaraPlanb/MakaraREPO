00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.001 line:85.83%,end
What? A Northernâ€¦

00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:30.962 line:85.83%,end
A Northern spy?

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:35.759 line:85.83%,end
I told you, didn't I?

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:39.513 line:85.83%,end
That you shouldn't let
such a pretty, young girl

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.014 line:85.83%,end
beside your husband.

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:44.893 line:85.83%,end
Goodness. She must've done everything
to get on his good side,

00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:47.687 line:85.83%,end
so they must be quite intimate.

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.108 line:85.83%,end
Quite intimate?

00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:52.150 line:85.83%,end
What--

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.825 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Kim.

00:52:00.325 --> 00:52:02.786 line:85.83%,end
<i>Honey!</i>

00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:05.080 line:85.83%,end
Why did you leave the door wide open?

00:52:05.163 --> 00:52:08.750 line:85.83%,end
What if someone comes
and steals away my precious little fox?

00:52:13.421 --> 00:52:15.882 line:85.83%,end
You bastards! What are you doing here?

00:52:20.053 --> 00:52:21.471 line:85.83%,end
Are you crazy?

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.643 line:85.83%,end
Show him.

00:52:38.947 --> 00:52:41.533 line:85.83%,end
The dorm telephone operator tipped me off

00:52:43.118 --> 00:52:44.661 line:85.83%,end
that Kang Cheong-ya

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.080 line:85.83%,end
is a Northern spy.

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:53.503 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:55.463 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya's real name is

00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:57.465 line:85.83%,end
Kanemoto Riko.

00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:00.552 line:85.83%,end
The fact that
she's a Korean-Japanese would be

00:53:00.635 --> 00:53:02.804 line:85.83%,end
enough for me to make her a Northern spy.

00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.475 line:85.83%,end
But she so kindly left us
plenty of evidence.

00:53:11.771 --> 00:53:14.900 line:85.83%,end
Chief An, there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.277 line:85.83%,end
She and I are nothing

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.196 line:85.83%,end
but a doctor and a patient.

00:53:19.279 --> 00:53:20.697 line:85.83%,end
We're not what you think--

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.877 line:85.83%,end
Guys, why do you think

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.255 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam has kept it from us
that Kang got out of the dorm?

00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:42.219 line:85.83%,end
Number one, because the pretty spy
persuaded him to join her side.

00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:43.261 line:85.83%,end
Number two,

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:46.223 line:85.83%,end
because the pretty spy
sexually convinced him.

00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:47.557 line:85.83%,end
Number three,

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:49.851 line:85.83%,end
because he is

00:53:50.143 --> 00:53:52.270 line:85.83%,end
in love with the pretty spy.

00:53:56.775 --> 00:53:57.984 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:01.571 line:85.83%,end
How dare you treat me like this?
I'm Nam Tae-il!

00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:04.658 line:85.83%,end
I'm Nam Tae-il,
the President's right-hand man!

00:54:09.454 --> 00:54:10.455 line:85.83%,end
Arrest him.

00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:14.000 line:85.83%,end
How dare you touch my body, you bastards!
Let go of me!

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.585 line:85.83%,end
Do you have a death wish?

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.596 line:85.83%,end
Should I do it like you'd do it?

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:30.600 line:85.83%,end
How about I shoot you to death right here

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.854 line:85.83%,end
and frame the Northern spy
Kang Cheong-ya for it?

00:54:36.898 --> 00:54:39.526 line:85.83%,end
Just like you did to Eun Chang-su.

00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:50.537 line:85.83%,end
<i>I had no other choice
since it happened so fast.</i>

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.539 line:85.83%,end
<i>I think she ran away.</i>

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:55.000 line:85.83%,end
<i>I searched everywhere,
but I can't find her.</i>

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.961 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:54:58.044 --> 00:55:01.798 line:85.83%,end
You helped a Northern spy, so your father
won't be able to help you this time.

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.384 line:85.83%,end
Go hide somewhere.

00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.345 line:85.83%,end
Be safe. Over and out.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.197 line:85.83%,end
<i>Hey.</i>

00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:30.785 line:85.83%,end
You must be hungry.

00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:48.928 line:85.83%,end
Eat this. Come on.

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.598 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? Put that away.

00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:56.895 line:85.83%,end
I'm not hungry at all.

00:55:56.978 --> 00:55:59.647 line:85.83%,end
So you have this.

00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:01.983 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:08.365 line:85.83%,end
My dear sonâ€¦

00:56:09.616 --> 00:56:11.368 line:85.83%,end
My little puppy.

00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:15.455 line:85.83%,end
Come on. Eat this.

00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:17.665 line:85.83%,end
Open up.

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.461 line:85.83%,end
Come on.
