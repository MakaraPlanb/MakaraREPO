EPISODE 14

3
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:19,786
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

4
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,635
<i>Who said anything about the agency?</i>

5
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,097
She must bring the money here
for us to ruin their scheme.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,225
That's the only way to save the hostages

7
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,353
and arrest Taedong River 1 and the rest.
Over and out.

8
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:05,373
Are all Southern bastards
backstabbing sly rats like you,

9
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,584
just as I heard?

10
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:15,633
Betrayal or not, I still have to do it.

11
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,426
I'm going to arrest you

12
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,428
and make you defect.

13
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:20,721
Don't get ahead of yourself!

14
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:26,435
I only joined hands with you to survive.
That doesn't mean I've chosen the South.

15
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,313
But you can't go back anyway
since you're branded a traitor.

16
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:30,273
I…

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,820
Even if I want to, I can never defect
to the South because of Su-hui.

18
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,532
Fine.

19
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,534
I understand.

20
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,661
I really do.

21
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,166
So let's lower our guns.

22
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,210
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.

23
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,754
Don't you agree?

24
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,405
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:22,408
We will blow up the dorm at midnight.

26
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:26,329
Understood, sir.

27
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,958
Make up some excuse
and kick the reporters out of the campus.

28
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,544
And make it look
like the commies blew themselves up.

29
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:36,339
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,841
But if we do that,

31
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,344
the hostage situation will be over.

32
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,971
Should we pay the North right away?

33
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:44,972
Of course not!

34
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,308
They don't deserve to be paid early.

35
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,852
The payment's supposed to be made
after the election anyway.

36
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:51,062
Let's take our time.

37
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,149
Put it off as late as possible
to make them anxious.

38
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,361
-As late as possible to make them anxious.
-That's right.

39
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:07,578
Hello?

40
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,499
It's Choi, sir.

41
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:15,670
What is it?

42
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:18,756
<i>Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon
of the MSS wants to talk to you, sir.</i>

43
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:21,842
Choi Su-ryeon?

44
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,429
<i>So just trust Kang Cheong-ya and wait?</i>

45
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,935
With that huge amount of money,

46
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:33,813
she could live a new life
in any country in the world.

47
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,357
A luxurious life, at that.

48
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,735
But we just trust her
to come back to this bomb-rigged dorm?

49
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,321
I mean, do you think

50
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,241
she's an angel?

51
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,368
Or a saint?

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,498
Yes,

53
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:54,667
you're right.

54
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,586
I'm as anxious as you are.

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,549
It's hundreds of billions of won.

56
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,427
She might flee to another country with it.

57
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:05,928
No,

58
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:09,265
she might talk Nam Tae-il
into killing us all

59
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,684
and manage to keep her identity hidden.

60
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:16,063
So if she finds out
we're tailing and watching her,

61
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:18,983
how do you think she'll react?

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,903
What you're doing

63
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,531
is the same as forcing her

64
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:27,867
to betray us. Okay?

65
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:45,760
Now, I have no choice…

66
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,431
but to trust and wait for Comrade Kang.

67
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,898
I have no other choice.

68
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,017
BLOW YOURSELVES UP WITH THE HOSTAGES BY
MIDNIGHT, OR LIM SU-HUI WILL BE EXECUTED

69
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,572
Once the meeting with Choi Mi-hye is over,
someone from Swiss BR Bank will come.

70
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:54,370
Your job is to go to the bank with them
and wire the money to the paper company.

71
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,496
Got it.

72
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:04,630
Didn't you tell them
not to clean the room until checkout?

73
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:05,798
I did.

74
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:42,751
What are you doing?

75
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,254
If I pray,

76
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:53,382
will it be answered?

77
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,227
Is something

78
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,730
wrong?

79
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,235
No.

80
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,738
It's all right.

81
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,835
I'm sorry I've put you

82
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:32,880
through all this.

83
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,432
If you hadn't met me,

84
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:48,062
you wouldn't be suffering all this pain.

85
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,151
But you are…

86
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,572
not doing this by choice.

87
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,494
If…

88
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:08,207
If you and I were

89
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,751
just ordinary people,

90
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:14,463
what would it have been like?

91
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,578
I probably…

92
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:54,211
would be singing at some music cafe.

93
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,179
Singing?

94
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,226
I wanted…

95
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,731
to become a musician like my dad.

96
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,526
Even after we were
kicked out to the coal town,

97
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,488
he would make songs

98
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:25,576
about flowers, wind, and love
and sing them to us.

99
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:31,582
Su-hui and I would sing along.

100
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,925
And I think that's what kept us smiling…

101
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,721
even in that cold, barren place.

102
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,517
So I also…

103
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,147
want to live

104
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,568
singing such songs to the people I love.

105
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,000
If…

106
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,837
you sing at a music cafe,

107
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,134
I'll go to that cafe every day…

108
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,388
Every single day,

109
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,308
whether it rains or snows.

110
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:51,161
I'd love to hear

111
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:53,872
you sing.

112
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,599
<i>It's a shame
what happened to Director Eun.</i>

113
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:17,145
But technically, your agent persuaded
my agent to betray us.

114
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,189
Your side is also to blame.

115
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:21,692
Look, Comrade Deputy Director.

116
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,068
Are you serious?

117
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:26,405
Your guy shot our ANSP director,
for God's sake!

118
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,782
This scheme is worth 300 million dollars,

119
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,951
but you sent some soon-to-be traitor!

120
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,453
And you blame us? Are you kidding me?

121
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:37,165
The hostage situation can't drag on
any longer, so we took special measures.

122
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,836
I sent him a message
that his sister will die if he doesn't

123
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,130
<i>blow himself up
with the hostages by midnight.</i>

124
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:44,965
So trust me and be patient.

125
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,634
By midnight today?

126
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,222
He may not the most loyal soldier,

127
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,975
but he's extremely devoted to his sister.

128
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:56,685
I'm sure he'll blow himself up.

129
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,438
So as soon as he does,

130
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,982
wire the 300 million dollars as promised.

131
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,124
This is great!

132
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,293
Them blowing themselves up from inside?

133
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,629
That'll make things a lot easier for us.

134
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,297
Absolutely, sir.

135
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,925
It seems everything's going smoothly.

136
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,802
ANSP DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

137
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,096
If this last one thing's taken care of,

138
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,516
it'll really be all good.

139
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,103
What is it, sir?
Is there something bothering you?

140
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,442
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

141
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,201
VIP ROOM

142
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,245
<i>What do we do about Eun?</i>

143
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,706
If he wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

144
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,210
Because he must know who shot him.

145
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,056
Honey! No…

146
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,851
You can't leave me behind like this.

147
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:24,356
Our Yeong-ung is only nine years old now.

148
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,401
And our dear Yeong-u

149
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:31,113
was killed by those bastards too.

150
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,615
If you die too…

151
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:37,411
Hello?

152
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,873
Mr. Nam, it's Choi again.

153
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:46,753
Hello?

154
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:47,796
Tae-il.

155
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,882
You should turn on MBS News right now.

156
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,759
MBS News?

157
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,684
<i>The longer he is in shock
due to excessive bleeding,</i>

158
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,937
<i>the less likely he is to survive.</i>

159
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,689
<i>So we can't</i>

160
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:08,734
<i>be sure yet if he's going to make it.</i>

161
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:12,070
That means he may not make it.

162
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,782
-My goodness. That's such a shame.
<i>-Honey, no!</i>

163
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,785
<i>I don't think
we have to do anything to get rid of him.</i>

164
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,203
Don't worry.

165
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,872
Okay, I understand.

166
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,876
<i>-Honey!</i>
-Goodness.

167
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,544
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU
IN CRITICAL CONDITION

168
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,088
-I feel so bad for him.
<i>-You can't die like this.</i>

169
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,299
He's always put our country and people

170
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:35,469
before his family, you know.

171
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,853
The password is

172
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,064
your birthday.

173
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:51,860
If anything goes wrong, I'm dead meat.
Literally. You know that, right?

174
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,196
God, don't be such a coward.

175
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,740
You said you looked into it too.

176
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:58,158
Yes.

177
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:01,787
There really is a fund manager
named Linda Young at ABK Partners.

178
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,913
See?

179
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,793
She's the precious person my fortuneteller
told me about. He can't be wrong.

180
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,170
What about the company bankbook and seal?

181
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:15,342
I opened it in a rush as you said, but
why do we need a corporate bank account?

182
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,511
It's such a huge amount of money.

183
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,387
So we'll send the money abroad

184
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,099
as if this corporate is investing
in the paper company.

185
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:25,602
Then the paper company will invest
the money in the private equity fund.

186
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,439
This won't do. I'll go with you.

187
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:32,526
The Chief of the ANSP OPC
should be present so that they can't--

188
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,319
You can't be serious!

189
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:39,491
Do you want everyone to know
you're using the ANSP secret fund?

190
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,993
You're right.

191
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:46,540
The company's
in the name of Ms. Kim, right?

192
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:49,292
Of course. In the name of Kim Ye-ni.

193
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:53,421
I got to say,
you're as clever as Hannibal.

194
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,590
It's like you knew this would happen

195
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:59,511
and hired a Korean-American
as your secretary. You're amazing.

196
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,930
Stop saying silly things.

197
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:04,766
Just a week.

198
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,061
In just a week,
we will make 90 million dollars.

199
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:11,523
That's 71.3 billion won!

200
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,652
All you need to do is
buy me one week's time.

201
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,237
Okay?

202
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,488
Don't worry.

203
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:23,785
Nam Tae-il told me to take my time
before sending the money.

204
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:18,673
Once you sign it,

205
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,717
you'll be a member
of the private equity fund.

206
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,929
<i>Promise me…</i>

207
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:34,601
you'll leave with me if I come back.

208
00:22:58,875 --> 00:22:59,709
It's me.

209
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,761
I got the pocket change
that was to be sent North.

210
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,226
Great job.

211
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,019
You must…

212
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,481
come back by midnight.

213
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,652
Put Lee Gang-mu on.

214
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:36,287
Speaking.

215
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:40,291
Mr. Lee, I understand
you did what you had to do,

216
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,294
<i>but I'm quite offended.</i>

217
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:45,213
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

218
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:47,382
No more tailing me.

219
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,553
Jang Han-na.

220
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,054
<i>Understood?</i>

221
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:58,893
Damn it. What do I do?

222
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,147
You're going to support me now, Han-na.

223
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:05,400
<i>Once I'm gone,
Nam Tae-il will find it strange.</i>

224
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:07,777
<i>Just in case,</i>

225
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:10,738
<i>we must find evidence that can stop him.</i>

226
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:13,241
Bring a SWAT team uniform

227
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:15,660
to my hideout exactly in an hour.

228
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,371
<i>If you understood, Gang-mu, put Soo-ho on.</i>

229
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:29,215
We'll distract them
for you to come back in safely.

230
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:33,344
No, I'll find a way to get in on my own,
so don't bother.

231
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,473
I'll come in by 2200 hours at the latest.

232
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:49,861
You even bugged her?

233
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:58,369
Do you still not trust her?

234
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:02,874
Before she shows up in front of me,
honestly, no.

235
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:11,966
It needs recharging.

236
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:20,808
Where the heck is it?

237
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,901
Ma'am.

238
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,862
Does the wiretapping room
still have power?

239
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,156
This needs recharging.

240
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,367
Yes. I'll do it for you.

241
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:12,235
So soon?

242
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,904
But she went out only yesterday.

243
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:16,531
She did it in a day?

244
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,700
She even managed
to become Nam Tae-il's doctor.

245
00:26:18,783 --> 00:26:21,661
She must have substantial intel.

246
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:24,622
She'll come back tonight. Han-na's
watching her, so let's wait and see.

247
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,874
But will she really come back?

248
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,460
I mean, what's in it for her?

249
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,212
I'm not sure.

250
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:37,051
I guess love is more important to her
than ideology or principles.

251
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:42,473
Of course, love is more important
than ideology or principles.

252
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:49,314
Whether you're a man or a woman,
that's the truth of life.

253
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:55,820
If Kang Cheong-ya really comes back,

254
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:00,742
I should learn a lesson from her.

255
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:16,049
<i>Comes back?</i>

256
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:20,887
<i>Wait a second.
Did Kang Cheong-ya get out of the dorm?</i>

257
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:04,222
A charger must be somewhere in here.

258
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,989
Darn it.

259
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,193
Hello?

260
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,738
<i>Who is this?</i>

261
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:03,614
The telephone operator?

262
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:05,992
Yes. This is Gye Bun-ok.

263
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,786
Yeong-ro and I are really close.

264
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,622
I can help you
get only Yeong-ro out of here.

265
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,085
Watch what you say.
Who said we'd only get her out?

266
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,795
Stop talking nonsense and turn it off.

267
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:19,505
Wait!

268
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:23,009
You'll be promoted
if you catch the Northern spy, right?

269
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:24,802
Do you want my help?

270
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:30,433
You can help me catch Lim Soo-ho?
How will you do that?

271
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:34,061
Well, I will give you
very useful information.

272
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:36,981
In return, you must help me later.

273
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:44,822
Dr. Kang Cheong-ya
of Hankuk Central Medical Center

274
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,033
is a Northern spy.

275
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:58,002
What did you just say?
Kang Cheong-ya is what?

276
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,129
She is a Northern spy!

277
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:03,132
<i>She must be out of the dorm right now--</i>

278
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,512
Hello? Hey!

279
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:09,555
Darn it.

280
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:24,904
Where on earth
did my precious little fox go?

281
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:26,614
I can't reach her all day.

282
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,791
Seung-jun!

283
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:38,876
That startled me.

284
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,088
What's wrong with that bastard?

285
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:45,341
Chief An? It's me.

286
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:48,803
Can you come to my husband's
hospital room right now?

287
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:52,640
I'm quite busy at the moment.

288
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:54,809
Can't we just talk over the phone?

289
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:58,729
I'm asking you to come here

290
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,816
because it's not something
I can tell you over the phone.

291
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,817
Ma'am.

292
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:07,071
I'm carrying out an important task
with our country's honor on the line.

293
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:09,282
I've got to go.

294
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:12,702
Chief An!

295
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:17,582
How rude…

296
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,340
Nam planted his man right under your nose.

297
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:29,427
How come you don't have
anyone loyal to you?

298
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:32,722
Loyal to me?

299
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:35,391
Do you know agent Jang Han-na?

300
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:40,313
She told me
that Nam Tae-il's the one who shot you.

301
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,231
How about we use her?

302
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,861
Jang Han-na…

303
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:17,850
God damn it.

304
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:19,036
Come on. Pick up the phone!

305
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:36,804
Cheong-ya, get out of there!
An Gyeong-hui's going up to get you!

306
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,428
Search thoroughly.

307
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:27,313
Kang Cheong-ya!

308
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:41,368
Damn it. Why is it so narrow?

309
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:45,372
Look at this.

310
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,271
CHOI MI-HYE

311
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,235
Cheong-ya, get in!

312
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:16,529
Hurry up!

313
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,948
What are you waiting for? Get in! Now!

314
00:35:32,336 --> 00:35:34,922
<i>This is why I told you to arrest Han-na!</i>

315
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:39,260
Put Cheong-ya on the no-fly list
and put out an APB on her. Han-na, too.

316
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:41,720
Damn it.

317
00:35:58,237 --> 00:35:59,780
We found this.

318
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:00,865
What is it?

319
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:07,371
What?

320
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,770
What on earth are they up to?

321
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,648
They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die.

322
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:00,925
The ANSP director's daughter?

323
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:09,642
What does that mean?

324
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,103
"They'll never let
the ANSP director's daughter die"?

325
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,859
No, it's nothing.

326
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:22,112
You damn wench.

327
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:23,989
Hey.

328
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:26,617
Are you still looking down on me?

329
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,663
There's no commie to save you in here.

330
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,709
Talk while I'm asking nicely.

331
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,378
Now.

332
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:42,633
The truth is…

333
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,567
Gosh,

334
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:02,486
the song's really great.

335
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,280
How holy.

336
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:12,037
Sir.

337
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:14,623
Wake up, sir!

338
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:18,168
The ANSP director's daughter is in here.

339
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,589
Why the hell are you not using
that amazing card?

340
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,052
What are you talking about?

341
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,930
The ANSP director's daughter is in here?

342
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:38,480
I mean,

343
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:42,359
you could use the daughter
and demand a bus or something.

344
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:45,154
Why are you not using her
to get out of here?

345
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:48,198
So who is it?
Who's the ANSP director's daughter?

346
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:50,451
No way, that's impossible.

347
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,911
Why would the ANSP director's daughter
live in a dorm?

348
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:56,707
Well, the hall director must know
if that's true.

349
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,840
What…

350
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:06,508
Well,

351
00:39:07,718 --> 00:39:09,762
speak of the devil.

352
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,269
What?

353
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,067
What's going on?

354
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:25,694
Yeong-ro.

355
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:32,326
Your father is the ANSP director?

356
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,083
No.

357
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,294
Guys, that can't be true.
You know her father runs a rice cake shop.

358
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:45,255
-She gave out rice cakes, remember?
-Hey!

359
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:46,673
You be quiet.

360
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:50,094
I asked her. You better tell the truth.

361
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:52,221
Is your father the ANSP director?

362
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:01,188
It must be true.

363
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,190
The director's name is Eun Chang-su.

364
00:40:03,273 --> 00:40:06,068
Yeong-ro's the only one in here
whose family name

365
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:07,569
is Eun.

366
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:09,738
No way.

367
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,533
Eun Yeong-ro.

368
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,536
Is it…

369
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:18,163
Is it really true?

370
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:28,132
Jeong-min, I'm sorry.

371
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,342
I didn't mean to lie to you--

372
00:40:30,426 --> 00:40:35,013
Did you tell us your parents ran
a rice cake shop to keep it from us?

373
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:38,600
No, that's not it.
My grandma does run a rice cake shop.

374
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:41,437
Isn't the ANSP director
the one trying to kill us all?

375
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,522
Yeong-ro's such a murderer's daughter?

376
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:44,731
That's so creepy!

377
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:48,193
This must be why she didn't tell you.
Don't you think?

378
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:50,654
Are you taking her side
since you're an ANSP spy?

379
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:53,198
Eun Yeong-ro.

380
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:56,535
Listen carefully.

381
00:40:58,537 --> 00:41:00,539
My brother used to weigh 78kg,

382
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,625
but after a month
of being locked up in the ANSP,

383
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,669
he's now 50kg.

384
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:09,548
He was so ashamed that he'd given in

385
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,592
that he blamed himself

386
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:15,137
and went insane in the end.

387
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:19,099
The head of those
who strive to torture innocent people

388
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:21,435
is her father?

389
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:23,604
Yes.

390
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,149
The one who gives them incentives

391
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,444
to encourage them to dedicate themselves

392
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:33,363
to their country and people

393
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,949
must be her dad.

394
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:41,663
Hey.

395
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:45,083
Your dad's trying to kill us all
even when you're in here?

396
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,752
Of course not.

397
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:49,379
He must be trying
to save only his daughter.

398
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:52,341
He's the powerful ANSP director after all.

399
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,343
That's obvious.

400
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:09,608
Eun Yeong-ro.

401
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:11,777
Don't you

402
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,571
ever come into our room.

403
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,701
Let's go, girls.

404
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,295
-And she gets a scholarship?
-She's really something.

405
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:32,965
-She's really scary.
-What an amazing dad you've got.

406
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:35,551
How could you lie about such--

407
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,344
What's the use of talking to such a liar?

408
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:39,096
I'm disappointed, Yeong-ro.

409
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:44,518
Yeong-ro. I can't believe that's true.

410
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:49,815
There's no one to trust in this world.

411
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,277
She's so creepy.

412
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,198
I really thought

413
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:01,660
you were a nice person.
How could you fool us all this time?

414
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,382
How could you…

415
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:21,138
How could you lie to me too?

416
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:24,266
Seol-hui.

417
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:15,233
Are you okay?

418
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:24,868
I'm… I'm fine.

419
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,789
It's true I've kept it from them
that I'm the ANSP director's daughter.

420
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,542
And it's true that my dad did bad things.

421
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:38,256
They're just on edge
with all they've been going through.

422
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,217
They will understand you

423
00:44:41,385 --> 00:44:42,636
someday.

424
00:44:44,137 --> 00:44:45,639
Thank you.

425
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,532
I'm really fine.

426
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:56,830
<i>I doubt it was someone in the dorm
that ratted on me.</i>

427
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:06,256
After ratting on me,

428
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:09,384
you helped me escape.

429
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:13,763
What are you trying to pull?

430
00:48:21,771 --> 00:48:22,981
Look, doctor.

431
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:25,984
You must go back
into the dorm for Gang-mu to live.

432
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,320
Why would I rat on you?

433
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:39,331
The North told Soo-ho
they'd kill his sister if he doesn't

434
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:41,917
blow up the hostages and himself
by midnight.

435
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,252
So you must get back in!

436
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:49,633
So you should've done as I said.

437
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:52,093
I warned you to stop keeping an eye on me.

438
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:55,138
And the ANSP raided my hideout
now of all times?

439
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,265
Wow.

440
00:48:58,308 --> 00:49:00,477
This is what I get for saving you?

441
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:03,355
You didn't get caught, did you?

442
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:28,713
This is Charmant.

443
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:33,468
Ma'am. It's your husband.

444
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,723
God, he's such a coward.
I'm getting tired of this.

445
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:40,934
How many times has he been calling me?

446
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:45,313
What is it this time?

447
00:49:45,397 --> 00:49:47,357
What's the relationship
between you and Cheong-ya?

448
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,150
Who the hell is Cheong-ya?

449
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:51,778
You know, Nam Tae-il's doctor.

450
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:54,197
The one that's being held hostage
in the dorm.

451
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,783
<i>She had photos of you.</i>

452
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:58,243
Don't be surprised.

453
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:03,123
It turns out, she's a Northern spy.

454
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:05,083
Dr. Kang is?

455
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:07,419
Oh, my goodness.

456
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:10,505
Are you serious? Is it really true?

457
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:12,382
Hello.

458
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:13,925
<i>I'm serious.</i>

459
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,137
<i>You really have
nothing to do with her, right?</i>

460
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,931
She even kept watch on you and me.

461
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:23,643
Oh, my God. She's kept watch on me?

462
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,438
Well, I…

463
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:29,232
Playing mahjong with her
a few times is all.

464
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:32,402
Don't worry a thing, honey.

465
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:34,988
Yes, that's all.

466
00:50:38,783 --> 00:50:40,910
By the way, our Mr. Nam

467
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:43,955
must be in trouble now.

468
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:45,331
Yes.

469
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,502
Go easy on him, honey. Okay?

470
00:50:49,586 --> 00:50:51,046
Go easy on him.

471
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:52,547
Bye.

472
00:50:58,094 --> 00:51:00,597
What's going on? He's in trouble?

473
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:03,808
Did something happen to my husband?

474
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:06,853
Goodness.

475
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:12,108
It's about Dr. Kang.

476
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,863
Mr. Nam's doctor.

477
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:22,911
It turns out,

478
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:25,371
she's a Northern spy.

479
00:51:27,749 --> 00:51:30,001
What? A Northern…

480
00:51:31,377 --> 00:51:32,962
A Northern spy?

481
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:37,759
I told you, didn't I?

482
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:41,513
That you shouldn't let
such a pretty, young girl

483
00:51:41,596 --> 00:51:43,014
beside your husband.

484
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:46,893
Goodness. She must've done everything
to get on his good side,

485
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:49,687
so they must be quite intimate.

486
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:53,108
Quite intimate?

487
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:54,150
What--

488
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,825
Ms. Kim.

489
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:04,786
<i>Honey!</i>

490
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:07,080
Why did you leave the door wide open?

491
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:10,750
What if someone comes
and steals away my precious little fox?

492
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:17,882
You bastards! What are you doing here?

493
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:23,471
Are you crazy?

494
00:52:27,642 --> 00:52:28,643
Show him.

495
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:43,533
The dorm telephone operator tipped me off

496
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,661
that Kang Cheong-ya

497
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,080
is a Northern spy.

498
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:55,503
What?

499
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:57,463
Kang Cheong-ya's real name is

500
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,465
Kanemoto Riko.

501
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:02,552
The fact that
she's a Korean-Japanese would be

502
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,804
enough for me to make her a Northern spy.

503
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:09,475
But she so kindly left us
plenty of evidence.

504
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,900
Chief An, there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

505
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:19,277
She and I are nothing

506
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,196
but a doctor and a patient.

507
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,697
We're not what you think--

508
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:35,877
Guys, why do you think

509
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,255
Mr. Nam has kept it from us
that Kang got out of the dorm?

510
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:44,219
Number one, because the pretty spy
persuaded him to join her side.

511
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:45,261
Number two,

512
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:48,223
because the pretty spy
sexually convinced him.

513
00:53:48,306 --> 00:53:49,557
Number three,

514
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:51,851
because he is

515
00:53:52,143 --> 00:53:54,270
in love with the pretty spy.

516
00:53:58,775 --> 00:53:59,984
You bastard.

517
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:03,571
How dare you treat me like this?
I'm Nam Tae-il!

518
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:06,658
I'm Nam Tae-il,
the President's right-hand man!

519
00:54:11,454 --> 00:54:12,455
Arrest him.

520
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:16,000
How dare you touch my body, you bastards!
Let go of me!

521
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,585
Do you have a death wish?

522
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,596
Should I do it like you'd do it?

523
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:32,600
How about I shoot you to death right here

524
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:36,854
and frame the Northern spy
Kang Cheong-ya for it?

525
00:54:38,898 --> 00:54:41,526
Just like you did to Eun Chang-su.

526
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,537
<i>I had no other choice
since it happened so fast.</i>

527
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:54,539
<i>I think she ran away.</i>

528
00:54:54,622 --> 00:54:57,000
<i>I searched everywhere,
but I can't find her.</i>

529
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,961
All right.

530
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:03,798
You helped a Northern spy, so your father
won't be able to help you this time.

531
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,384
Go hide somewhere.

532
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:09,345
Be safe. Over and out.

533
00:55:26,988 --> 00:55:28,197
<i>Hey.</i>

534
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:32,785
You must be hungry.

535
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:50,928
Eat this. Come on.

536
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:53,598
What are you doing? Put that away.

537
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:58,895
I'm not hungry at all.

538
00:55:58,978 --> 00:56:01,647
So you have this.

539
00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:03,983
Come on.

540
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:10,365
My dear son…

541
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,368
My little puppy.

542
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:17,455
Come on. Eat this.

543
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:19,665
Open up.

544
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,461
Come on.

545
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:30,510
Come on. Open up.

546
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:38,810
Mom.

547
00:56:41,938 --> 00:56:45,775
Come on, you must be hungry. Eat it.

548
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:47,985
Open up.

549
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:08,756
Comrade Lim.

550
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:23,980
Comrade Joo.

551
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:27,024
Comrade Kang

552
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:31,737
went out to intercept the money
they're going to send the North,

553
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:34,907
and the ANSP found out about her.

554
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,869
Is that really true?

555
00:57:39,162 --> 00:57:41,164
She's one of Lim Ji-rok's people.

556
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:44,584
Even if I tell him about this,

557
00:57:45,626 --> 00:57:48,212
he'll try to cover up her betrayal.

558
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:51,507
I don't care what happens to traitors.

559
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:56,220
Comrade Kang went out
to intercept the money to save us

560
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:58,556
when our country abandoned us.

561
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,434
With that money,

562
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:05,062
we might be able
to cut a deal with Lim Ji-rok.

563
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:14,989
Your superior…

564
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:19,368
must be rivals with Lim Ji-rok.

565
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:22,163
We must inform your superior of this

566
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:24,332
to get Lim Ji-rok.

567
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:35,468
You've got some nerve.

568
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:40,473
You want to take down the head of the UFD
when you're surrounded by enemies?

569
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:47,188
Lim Ji-rok told me

570
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:51,108
if we don't blow ourselves up by midnight…

571
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:55,738
that he'd kill my sister.

572
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:59,242
I will never let him have his way.

573
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,626
It must be great
to have a powerful father.

574
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:15,716
Are you sure you can kill him?

575
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:23,766
Gyeok-chan.

576
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:28,563
My father…

577
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:34,277
was a coal miner
in North Hamgyong Province.

578
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:37,321
And a mine roof collapse

579
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:40,366
killed him.

580
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:46,914
I've been fighting
for our country and people,

581
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:52,795
not for those who consider
our agents' lives as expendable.

582
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:59,468
Lim Ji-rok has us cornered.
We must get him first

583
01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:02,138
to find a way to survive.

584
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,480
I'm sure your superior will welcome…

585
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,319
any intel that can bring Lim down.

586
01:00:27,913 --> 01:00:28,956
Untie me.

587
01:01:02,073 --> 01:01:03,991
Moran Hill 1 intercepted the money

588
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:06,369
the South was going to send us.

589
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:08,412
And the ANSP found out about her.

590
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:12,708
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: CHONGCHON RIVER

591
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:15,795
"Kang Cheong-ya
would never betray the party"?

592
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:20,049
As if your son was not enough,
Kang's screwing us over too?

593
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,469
If we won't be able to get the money,

594
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:24,929
it's all on you!

595
01:01:31,394 --> 01:01:34,772
Instruct Chongchon River
to kill Lim Soo-ho right away!

596
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:53,833
That damn wench.

597
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:57,461
Shredding her body to pieces
wouldn't be enough.

598
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:01,882
How dare she fool me all this time
and seduce my husband!

599
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:04,468
I'm sure

600
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:06,804
he had no idea.

601
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:09,432
How could he have known
he was a Northern spy?

602
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:11,434
Even I was completely fooled!

603
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:17,273
Whether he knew or not,
he violated the National Security Law.

604
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:20,526
No, that's wrong. That's just wrong!

605
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:24,572
The one who lied is to blame.
Not the one who was fooled.

606
01:02:25,906 --> 01:02:27,283
That fortuneteller…

607
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:30,161
He must be a charlatan!

608
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:32,455
He said I should

609
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:36,876
have her stay by my husband's side
like a talisman!

610
01:02:37,626 --> 01:02:39,170
For him to live a long, healthy life

611
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:41,756
and make his dreams come true!

612
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:48,012
Why are you blaming the fortuneteller?

613
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:50,264
He's a really good fortuneteller.

614
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,522
You know what? I knew something was off

615
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:01,901
when he told Ms. Hong
exactly 13 people would die.

616
01:03:02,485 --> 01:03:06,697
I mean, he's still unconscious in bed.
How is he going to become the President?

617
01:03:09,116 --> 01:03:10,201
He must be a charlatan.

618
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,869
A charlatan!

619
01:03:14,914 --> 01:03:17,124
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

620
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:20,169
<i>-Please check the number and try again.</i>
-Not in service?

621
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:26,592
Wait a second. Isn't it 041-387-1234?

622
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:29,345
You must've dialed the wrong number.
Give it.

623
01:03:29,428 --> 01:03:30,679
My goodness.

624
01:03:36,852 --> 01:03:39,355
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

625
01:03:39,438 --> 01:03:41,774
<i>-Please check the number…</i>
-What?

626
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:44,610
This is weird. It can't be.

627
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:46,946
What's going on?

628
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:57,206
Ms. Kim!

629
01:03:58,833 --> 01:03:59,667
Yes, ma'am?

630
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,377
Call Hong Kong.

631
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,797
Ask them for Linda's number
in New York. Now.

632
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,756
Yes, ma'am.

633
01:04:06,257 --> 01:04:09,426
Do it here! Right now!

634
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,971
Hold on.
What's with Hong Kong and New York?

635
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:44,795
What? Why did they hang up like that?

636
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:48,173
I even signed the certificate
for the fund. What is wrong?

637
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:51,051
Well, they said
Linda Young's never been to Seoul.

638
01:04:51,135 --> 01:04:52,636
They even yelled at me.

639
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,681
What do you mean, she's never been here?

640
01:04:56,932 --> 01:04:59,727
She even gave me this 5-carat diamond.

641
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,312
As a token of their appreciation

642
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:05,608
since I became a VVIP
at ABK Partners! But what?

643
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:08,861
Oh, my God.

644
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,946
Five carats?

645
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,948
Let me see.

646
01:05:13,032 --> 01:05:15,200
We can easily tell if it's real

647
01:05:15,284 --> 01:05:17,536
by watching the condensation evaporate.

648
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,331
The condensation on a diamond
evaporates quickly.

649
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:37,306
It's fake.

650
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,559
It's just a cubic zirconia.

651
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:58,202
My goodness.

652
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:00,829
Sir!

653
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,581
Sir…

654
01:06:13,092 --> 01:06:13,926
What…

655
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,811
What the hell is this? This can't be!

656
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:27,439
Where the hell did he go?

657
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,191
Where did he go?

658
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,528
Hong Ae-ra wants to meet me.

659
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:33,821
What should I do?

660
01:06:35,114 --> 01:06:38,117
Hong Ae-ra? Maybe she's pulling tricks
to catch Cheong-ya.

661
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,119
The director's still unconscious,

662
01:06:40,202 --> 01:06:42,538
so I doubt she's interested
in catching Cheong-ya.

663
01:06:42,621 --> 01:06:44,289
I mean, she's not Nam Tae-il's wife.

664
01:06:44,373 --> 01:06:45,708
But it might be dangerous.

665
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:47,501
You're wanted now.

666
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:53,173
If Lim Soo-ho doesn't blow himself up,
Nam will

667
01:06:53,757 --> 01:06:55,592
set off the bombs for sure.

668
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:58,345
Time's running out,
so we must do everything we can.

669
01:06:59,054 --> 01:07:00,139
All right.

670
01:07:30,627 --> 01:07:32,504
Mr. Eun.

671
01:07:37,468 --> 01:07:39,428
You're the one

672
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:45,017
who brought the recording tape
inside the dorm, aren't you?

673
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,272
You did it to save the students,

674
01:07:52,483 --> 01:07:54,568
so I won't punish you for it.

675
01:07:56,445 --> 01:07:57,654
I…

676
01:07:59,364 --> 01:08:00,824
must…

677
01:08:05,996 --> 01:08:07,915
save my daughter.

678
01:08:11,001 --> 01:08:14,505
The North told Soo-ho
that they'll kill his sister

679
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:17,466
if he doesn't blow himself
and the hostages up by midnight.

680
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:20,761
So we must rescue the hostages
before midnight.

681
01:08:22,554 --> 01:08:24,807
I need to talk to Lim Soo-ho.

682
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:26,391
<i>This is Taedong River.</i>

683
01:08:27,226 --> 01:08:30,312
Moran Hill, do you copy?
This is Taedong River.

684
01:08:31,313 --> 01:08:33,649
She turned off her radio.
I'm sure she backed out!

685
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:37,653
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

686
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:40,697
Yes, I'm here.

687
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:48,664
Gang-mu.

688
01:08:49,498 --> 01:08:51,333
<i>This is Eun Chang-su.</i>

689
01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:01,510
I heard you were in critical condition.

690
01:09:02,803 --> 01:09:04,388
Was it fake news again?

691
01:09:08,308 --> 01:09:10,227
Is Lim Soo-ho with you?

692
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:22,281
<i>What do you want?</i>

693
01:09:24,825 --> 01:09:26,326
I want to help you.

694
01:09:28,162 --> 01:09:32,416
<i>If you release all the hostages
including my daughter,</i>

695
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:36,170
I'll have a car ready

696
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:38,630
in Mount Ogong

697
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,466
for you guys to escape.

698
01:09:42,926 --> 01:09:45,095
<i>I'll do everything in my power</i>

699
01:09:45,888 --> 01:09:47,848
<i>for you to flee</i>

700
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:50,434
<i>to another country safely.</i>

701
01:09:52,352 --> 01:09:54,229
<i>After everyone gets out,</i>

702
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,940
I'll blow the dorm up

703
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:59,610
and tell the press

704
01:10:00,527 --> 01:10:02,613
<i>the spies have blown themselves up.</i>

705
01:10:03,405 --> 01:10:05,532
<i>And I'll inform the North</i>

706
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,076
that you're dead.

707
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,496
Then your sister

708
01:10:12,998 --> 01:10:15,125
<i>will be safe.</i>

709
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:18,712
The students know

710
01:10:19,588 --> 01:10:22,591
about the election scheme,
but you want us to release them?

711
01:10:23,258 --> 01:10:25,928
Can you guarantee the students' safety?

712
01:10:27,346 --> 01:10:29,431
I'll have it broadcast live

713
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:33,310
and let them return to their parents
in the campus.

714
01:10:34,603 --> 01:10:36,271
Won't it be enough?

715
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,941
<i>And I'll release Reporter Gal</i>

716
01:10:39,942 --> 01:10:42,110
<i>and have him cover it.</i>

717
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:43,946
How about

718
01:10:45,155 --> 01:10:49,243
you tell the press yourself that
this is all part of the election scheme?

719
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:54,915
<i>That won't save
Soo-ho's sister in the North.</i>

720
01:10:55,582 --> 01:10:58,001
<i>I must stay in power</i>

721
01:10:58,502 --> 01:11:00,587
to send you guys

722
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:03,799
<i>to another country safely.</i>

723
01:11:22,317 --> 01:11:23,819
I'll think about it.

724
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:35,330
The students know about the election
scheme. If they're released,

725
01:11:35,414 --> 01:11:38,875
the ruling party might lose the election,

726
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:41,670
and you're likely to be put in danger.

727
01:11:43,755 --> 01:11:45,841
I know it's great to have power,

728
01:11:48,343 --> 01:11:51,346
but I'll never
trade my child's life for it.

729
01:11:57,352 --> 01:11:59,354
No one,

730
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:02,024
including Nam and An, can find out

731
01:12:02,107 --> 01:12:04,151
that he has awoken.

732
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:09,072
I understand. Don't worry.

733
01:12:22,961 --> 01:12:26,048
He must know Nam Tae-il's the one
who ordered to shoot him.

734
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:31,345
But he's giving up power
so easily like this?

735
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:33,889
You're right.

736
01:12:34,598 --> 01:12:37,768
The ruling party's winning right now.
He can't be giving up.

737
01:12:39,728 --> 01:12:43,523
If it's broadcast live
and the parents wait for him,

738
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:47,194
the students will be safe.

739
01:12:48,987 --> 01:12:52,282
But you were ordered
to kill the hostages too.

740
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:57,496
If it's broadcast live, the North will
watch it too. Will it be okay?

741
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,459
I'm sure the North's aware
Comrade Kang's cover's been blown,

742
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:04,503
so I don't think it'll matter.

743
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:08,090
I still have a bad feeling about this.
They might be

744
01:13:09,257 --> 01:13:11,301
setting a trap to save Yeong-ro only.

745
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:19,643
If my dad is planning to rescue only me,

746
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:22,771
there's a way to stop it.

747
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:28,819
Let me talk to my dad.

748
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:37,202
What did you say?

749
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,789
<i>After all the hostages have been released,</i>

750
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:46,336
I'll get in the car with Soo-ho.

751
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:50,507
Until he's left the country safely,

752
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:54,136
<i>I will stay by his side.</i>

753
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:57,848
You can't trust me

754
01:13:58,932 --> 01:14:00,475
that much?

755
01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:03,145
<i>I will</i>

756
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,814
do everything in my power

757
01:14:07,524 --> 01:14:09,860
to save Soo-ho's life.

758
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:16,658
I'm sorry, Dad. But I need to see
Soo-ho leaving the country safely

759
01:14:17,868 --> 01:14:19,411
with my own eyes.

760
01:14:29,504 --> 01:14:30,964
I understand.

761
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:34,843
Get in the car with him.

762
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:39,222
<i>I'll let you see him leaving safely</i>

763
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:41,600
with your own eyes.

764
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,699
She wants to stay with him
until he leaves.

765
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:02,537
So you follow them and bring my daughter

766
01:15:03,538 --> 01:15:05,499
back to me safely.

767
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:07,959
I will, sir.

768
01:15:08,668 --> 01:15:10,045
Go to the dorm

769
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:12,797
right now.

770
01:15:13,798 --> 01:15:16,259
I'll radio you as soon as it's ready.

771
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,428
So go stand by.

772
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:20,096
Yes, sir.

773
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,738
What a fool she is.

774
01:15:38,365 --> 01:15:42,744
Why on earth is she taking the side
of those commies who killed her brother?

775
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:49,834
Honey.

776
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:54,172
You're at the most important crossroads
of your life right now.

777
01:15:54,756 --> 01:15:58,510
If Yeong-ro's acting like this,
we won't be able to get her out.

778
01:15:59,094 --> 01:16:02,514
And if you try to fool them
and anything goes wrong because of her,

779
01:16:02,889 --> 01:16:04,307
your life will be ruined

780
01:16:04,891 --> 01:16:07,018
as well as Yeong-ung's.

781
01:16:08,937 --> 01:16:10,647
You think it'll be okay

782
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:13,984
if you work with their parents
to keep their mouths shut?

783
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:16,069
Of course,

784
01:16:16,278 --> 01:16:19,573
some sensible parents
will keep their children quiet,

785
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:21,533
but who knows?

786
01:16:21,616 --> 01:16:25,078
There are always troublemakers
like Reporter Gal.

787
01:16:27,122 --> 01:16:30,208
To be honest, I'm worried about Gal too.

788
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:33,712
You must think
you can keep him under control

789
01:16:33,795 --> 01:16:35,714
by threatening to kill his mother.

790
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:38,174
But who knows what'll get into him?

791
01:16:38,258 --> 01:16:42,262
What if he chooses justice
over his own mom?

792
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:48,893
So,

793
01:16:49,894 --> 01:16:52,230
stop thinking about it,

794
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:56,067
have the hostages released…

795
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:59,654
and when exactly 13 remain,

796
01:17:00,947 --> 01:17:03,450
blow up the bombs.

797
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:08,288
Ae-ra…

798
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:25,055
Hello?

799
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:27,724
Mr. Kim.

800
01:17:28,892 --> 01:17:30,769
Okay. Just a second.

801
01:17:34,064 --> 01:17:36,274
The President wants to talk to you.

802
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:39,277
I told the First Lady that you'd woken up.

803
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:43,865
Hello, sir.

804
01:17:45,784 --> 01:17:47,327
Mr. President, this is Eun Chang-su.

805
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:51,623
<i>Eun, is it true that
your daughter's held in the dorm?</i>

806
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,085
A long time ago,

807
01:17:55,669 --> 01:17:57,962
General Gyebaek
even killed his wife and children

808
01:17:58,046 --> 01:18:00,256
before he went out to war.

809
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:04,260
Remember that we are also at war.

810
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:25,156
We're all going to get out alive, right?

811
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:34,165
I'm relieved that my dad will be able

812
01:18:34,457 --> 01:18:37,627
to make up even a little
for what he did to my friends.

813
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:49,514
I thought about it,

814
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:58,690
and it's too dangerous
for you to stay with me until the end.

815
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:18,042
Soo-ho, I'll stay by your side
until the end.

816
01:19:31,139 --> 01:19:33,808
Blow the dorm up right away.

817
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:49,949
<i>The election is in six days.</i>

818
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:51,618
<i>If we all stay here like this,</i>

819
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:53,328
we'll all die.

820
01:19:53,953 --> 01:19:55,914
<i>"Eliminate Lim Soo-ho."</i>

821
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:58,875
<i>If you run with the money,
do you think the party will let you be?</i>

822
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:01,795
<i>They will hunt down every traitor</i>

823
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:04,172
<i>and kill them mercilessly.</i>

824
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:06,049
<i>Captain.</i>

825
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:07,884
At 22:00 sharp,

826
01:20:08,593 --> 01:20:11,888
we will blow up the dorm. Get it ready.

827
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:13,348
<i>How dare you…</i>

828
01:20:14,808 --> 01:20:15,892
<i>Decide.</i>

829
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,144
<i>Is it our agents</i>

830
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:20,188
<i>or the hostages?</i>

831
01:20:20,772 --> 01:20:22,023
<i>Soo-ho…</i>

832
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:24,651
<i>You said we'll meet again.</i>

833
01:20:25,985 --> 01:20:28,112
<i>You said we'll meet again someday</i>

834
01:20:28,696 --> 01:20:30,990
<i>as long as we're alive.</i>

835
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:32,617
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

836
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:37,831
<i>You know too that we're never
going to see each other again.</i>

837
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:39,791
Soo-ho!

838
01:20:46,589 --> 01:20:49,509
BONUS

839
01:21:27,505 --> 01:21:28,715
Thank you.

840
01:21:36,055 --> 01:21:37,807
Is this your first time in Poland?

841
01:21:39,183 --> 01:21:41,519
I'm a trader working in Berlin

842
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:44,022
and came to visit here
to check on something.

843
01:21:44,647 --> 01:21:45,940
Then…

844
01:21:47,233 --> 01:21:49,861
I was chased by some gangsters.

845
01:21:53,197 --> 01:21:55,116
If you don't mind me asking,

846
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,703
may I know your name?

847
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:05,001
You saved my life after all.

848
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:09,631
But I have so many names

849
01:22:10,423 --> 01:22:13,885
since I've been traveling
around the world to sell goods.

850
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:18,806
Oh, I see.

851
01:22:33,363 --> 01:22:35,782
I wish you good luck.
