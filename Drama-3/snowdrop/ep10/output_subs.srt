EPISODE 10

3
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,362
Everyone stop.

4
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,864
Comrade Kang.

5
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,040
Don't move.

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,502
If anyone moves…

7
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,469
What is this?

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,098
You want us all to die together?

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,688
Damn it.

10
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,731
What the hell.

11
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>A situation occurred. Sector 2 reporting.</i>

12
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,911
An explosion at Area 2-5.

13
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,039
Sector 3 reporting.
An explosion at Area 2-3 too.

14
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,082
Damn it!

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,333
How are the hostages?

16
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,418
Snipers, report.

17
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,628
Suppression team, stand by.

18
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,463
-Suppression team, stand by!
-Are you insane?

19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,299
All units stand by
until we find out what's going on!

20
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,156
Drop the gun.

21
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,331
Drop the gun.

22
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,102
Everyone, hands over your heads.

23
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,272
Hands over your heads!

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,486
What, the whole dorm would explode?

25
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,323
I was a fool to believe you.

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,329
Everyone get up.

27
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,206
Get up!

28
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,304
Now.

29
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,307
Go to the lobby.

30
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,476
Go to the lobby!

31
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,267
Sit.

32
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,121
It was you, wasn't it?
Where did you hide the money bag?

33
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,706
Is that important right now?

34
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,666
Can't you see they failed to escape?

35
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,001
You little…

36
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,961
I don't know where it is either.

37
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,047
I know you hid it.

38
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,049
Do you have a death wish?

39
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,051
Why don't we go get the bag now?

40
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,553
Keep your heads down.

41
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,141
Damn it!

42
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,231
I'll go check the second floor.

43
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,368
You little bastard.

44
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,757
Follow me.

45
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,303
Isn't that Sang-beom?

46
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,848
Sang-beom, what's going on?

47
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,184
Are you okay?

48
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,814
What did you do this time?

49
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,233
Where's Eung-cheol?

50
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,198
Once everything's settled,
block the secret passage first.

51
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,116
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,953
You fool.

53
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,759
We released 30 hostages,
yet you tried to escape?

54
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,971
Who put you up to it?

55
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,182
The ANSP?

56
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,019
Or the hall director?

57
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,315
Yes.

58
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,361
It was me.

59
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,197
The students just did as I said.

60
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
Is that so? You.

61
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,578
Were you hiding as she told you?

62
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,796
No.

63
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,009
That's not true.
I suggested escaping first.

64
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,594
Be quiet, Yeong-ro.

65
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,596
My brother's being buried today.

66
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,347
I wanted to go there.

67
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,016
I really wanted to be there,

68
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,726
so I asked her.

69
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,896
It was you again.

70
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,356
Because of you…

71
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,777
<i>my cover's been blown.</i>

72
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,532
Are you really a Northern spy?

73
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,453
Trying to help us and caring for us…

74
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,663
Were you putting on an act?

75
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,675
Eung-cheol!

76
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,344
Eung-cheol.

77
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,935
Eung-cheol!

78
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,397
Hey!

79
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,067
Eung-cheol!

80
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,402
Wake up, Eung-cheol!

81
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,154
Eung-cheol!

82
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,584
Eung-cheol! Wake up!

83
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,086
Comrade!

84
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,756
I can't hear you! Please speak louder!

85
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,803
Eung-cheol. Can you get up?

86
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,222
Hold me!

87
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,934
Let's go.

88
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,403
Comrade.

89
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,196
Our bag we hid in the lounge disappeared.

90
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,866
Move Eung-cheol first. Hurry!

91
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,633
Eung-cheol.

92
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,967
Eung-cheol!

93
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,719
Eung-cheol.

94
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,640
Comrade. Where are the hostages?

95
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,350
Did they escape?

96
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,060
No.

97
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,686
Everything's okay.

98
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,941
Don't worry.

99
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,528
Hang in there!

100
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,125
Sector 2-3 reporting.
We see Lim Soo-ho moving by the windows.

101
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,168
Sniping him is possible. Over.

102
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,796
<i>Hold fire.
Hold fire unless ordered otherwise.</i>

103
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,632
<i>Keep an eye on Lim Soo-ho
and keep me posted. Over.</i>

104
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,552
Move the phone to room 207

105
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,471
and set booby traps in front of
the cafeteria and between 204 and 211.

106
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,641
We must find our bag to set any bombs.

107
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,810
You know the guy who was after our money.

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,614
Why do they keep telling us
just to watch him?

109
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,158
How would I know?

110
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,451
Just do as told.

111
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>They have no intention of breaking in
despite the explosion.</i>

112
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,550
Send in every unit available
and suppress them right away.

113
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,013
<i>The bombs exploded in the cafeteria
where the hostages were kept</i>

114
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,891
<i>and in room 203
where the ANSP agent was kept.</i>

115
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,685
If anyone is injured,
we must get them out first.

116
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,148
The bomb exploded in the cafeteria
where the students were kept!

117
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,026
There's no way
they would've killed the hostages.

118
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,196
Think about it. They obey
the orders even if they have to die.

119
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,906
<i>You think they'd kill them?</i>

120
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,700
Someone must have touched
the booby traps by mistake.

121
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,870
Listen, you bastard.
My son's being buried today.

122
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,414
Are you going
to get my daughter killed too?

123
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,166
Honey.

124
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,418
The burial isn't important right now.

125
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,170
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

126
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,339
You should go to the scene yourself. Now.

127
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,507
Hurry.

128
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,716
Hello?

129
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,266
FUNERAL OF STAFF SERGEANT EUN YEONG-U

130
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,061
Only 13 must die.

131
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
Exactly 13.

132
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,941
No more, no less. Exactly 13.

133
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,485
Exactly 13. Please.

134
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,655
Sir. Please.

135
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,031
Sang-beom.

136
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,742
I'm telling the truth.

137
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,745
I'd open up my heart
and show you if I could.

138
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,082
I did find the money bag.

139
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,376
But I don't know where it is now.

140
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,128
Gye Bun-ok!

141
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,006
That wench hid it away!

142
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,716
That damn wench!

143
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,802
Bun-ok, please!

144
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,888
Just tell them.

145
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,307
You don't want to die, do you?

146
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,976
The habit of stealing from the students

147
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,270
must've made you steal their money too!

148
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,981
Did you see it?

149
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,858
I didn't do it.

150
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,068
You didn't?

151
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
Bun-ok.

152
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,245
Please.

153
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,962
-Sang-beom!
-I'll ask you one last time.

154
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,674
Answer on the count of three.

155
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,262
Please.

156
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680
Or he dies.

157
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,604
-One.
-Bun-ok, please!

158
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,483
You fool. Will you come clean
after someone dies because of you?

159
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,070
Bun-ok… Please, Bun-ok.

160
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,031
Bun-ok…

161
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,369
Two.

162
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,037
No. Please!

163
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,540
Please…

164
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
It's in the restroom!

165
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,425
Where the cleaning supplies are.

166
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,435
I saw it.

167
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,023
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

168
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,486
He was hiding the bag

169
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,197
in the restroom, and I saw it.

170
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
You b****.

171
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,165
I'll rip your mouth--

172
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,505
You saw him threatening and telling me
not to tell anyone, right?

173
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,756
Comrade Joo!

174
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,013
Set the booby traps first. Hurry up.

175
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,476
Eung-cheol's hurt.

176
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,937
I laid him down in room 212.

177
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,162
I told you…

178
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,292
I clearly told you
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

179
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,674
Now you will

180
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,968
never be released.

181
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,805
Dead or alive,

182
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,227
we're in the same boat now.

183
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,789
<i>No casualties have yet to be confirmed.</i>

184
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>People are deeply concerned
that the late initial response might</i>

185
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,627
<i>lead to injured hostages, if any,</i>

186
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,837
<i>-missing the golden hour…</i>
-My goodness.

187
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,173
What if the hostages all died?

188
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,842
Bombs exploded. I don't think

189
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,303
only 13 people died.

190
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,347
But exactly 13 girls might have died

191
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,058
just like the fortuneteller said.

192
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,060
Come on, ma'am.

193
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,314
When did the fortuneteller say
13 girls would die?

194
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,900
He said 13 should die.

195
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,027
You think I don't know that?

196
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,487
I'm so worried

197
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,449
because I have a feeling
that exactly 13 girls died.

198
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,700
Exactly 13.

199
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,160
Darn it.

200
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,748
<i>Chief An just came out.
Let's hear from him!</i>

201
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,212
<i>We can't rule out additional explosions.</i>

202
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,922
<i>So we're approaching very carefully…</i>

203
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,632
Is that your husband?

204
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,595
Your husband must be a natural on TV.

205
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,142
I mean, he had so little presence,

206
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,561
he was practically invisible.

207
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,938
But when he's in front of the cameras,

208
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,982
he becomes a different person.

209
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,859
My husband

210
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,735
mentioned that too.

211
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,284
Mr. An's really popular these days.

212
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,620
Even his fashion style is popular now.

213
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,749
Thanks to that, Ms. Choi has been
getting a lot of interview requests.

214
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,794
I'm not surprised.

215
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,796
Charlotte styles him after all.

216
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:40,554
I heard the sunglasses he wears sell well
even though it's winter. Right?

217
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,349
Those sunglasses?

218
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,519
The hostages' lives are put…

219
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,854
They're popular?

220
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,772
Try them on.

221
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,779
<i>Rescuing the hostages safely is</i>

222
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,364
<i>our top priority.</i>

223
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,035
<i>The President has already
instructed us to do everything</i>

224
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>in our power</i>

225
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>to rescue all of them safely…</i>

226
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,336
I'm sure I've seen that bastard somewhere.

227
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,467
In any case,

228
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,763
I owe you big time.

229
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,473
Don't mention it.

230
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,558
The ANSP exists

231
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,852
to protect sovereignty.

232
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,647
Sure.

233
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,944
Then it's also your job to protect me
to make my dad feel at ease, right?

234
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,656
You are right, sir.

235
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,245
That's the single
most important job for me,

236
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,080
An Gyeong-hui.

237
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,207
Right.

238
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,461
It's him!

239
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,257
He was quite clumsy back then.

240
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,509
Hey, give me the phone.

241
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,976
<i>You bastard. Are you an idiot?</i>

242
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,852
Did you forget about the plan?

243
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,273
I told you it must look like
you guys are making this drag on!

244
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,734
But what do you do?
You go ahead and blow up bombs?

245
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,736
Maybe I should've let them go.

246
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,865
The ANSP team leader was
about to escape with all of the hostages.

247
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,160
God, Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

248
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,245
-Salute!
-Salute!

249
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,000
You're meddling here again?

250
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,460
-Again? Huh?
-Get the suppression team ready.

251
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,212
All units stand by!

252
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,302
Lee Gang-mu, one of your men, was
about to escape with all of the hostages,

253
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,804
so they had no choice
but to blow up the bombs.

254
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,640
This is Eun Chang-su.

255
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,977
Once the suppression team goes in,
you'll all die in five minutes.

256
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,189
So tell me the truth.
Is Yeong-ro safe? And any casualties?

257
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,068
Calm down. I know this is a scheme.

258
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,948
All of the hostages
including your daughter are all safe.

259
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,202
Listen carefully. Seeing how
you unexpectedly blew up some bombs,

260
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,413
I can't let my daughter stay there.
Release her now.

261
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,707
What?

262
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,709
Are you insane?

263
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,879
Are you going to show
rescuing your daughter only

264
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,881
when all of the press cameras are here?

265
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,799
You were against it earlier!

266
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:27,054
Our agreement doesn't say
my daughter must be held hostage!

267
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,604
What about you?
You said we'd just rescue my daughter

268
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,190
if things got dangerous.
Why are you so worked up?

269
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,026
But we need some kind of insurance.

270
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,364
In case the word gets out.

271
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,620
If they find out your daughter is
also being held hostage,

272
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,164
who'll suspect it might be a scheme?

273
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,249
You son of a--

274
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,930
I, the ANSP director,
guarantee your safe return.

275
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,307
So release my daughter right now.

276
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,479
To return safely,
we need your daughter here.

277
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,773
Release her right this instant!

278
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,984
Be patient. I will in eight days.

279
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,529
You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?

280
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,449
I can prove that your daughter is safe.

281
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,911
All right. In exactly five minutes,

282
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,122
bring her to the cafeteria.

283
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,751
She'll stand by the windows in the lounge.

284
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,673
The press is watching us. They'll
see me only checking my daughter's safety.

285
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,675
Bring her to the cafeteria!

286
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,510
Or I'll send in the suppression team!

287
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,057
Get the snipers ready. Tell them to
kill him as soon as he brings my daughter!

288
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,892
Sniper team, this is Captain.

289
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,186
What are you doing?
Are you going to break in?

290
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,857
They even blew up bombs. We should act.
If we hesitate,

291
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,986
people will find it suspicious.
They might find out it's a scheme!

292
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,363
That's just what you think.

293
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,867
I already told our boss
this will drag on until the election.

294
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,826
Order them!

295
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,664
Kill Taedong River 1
as soon as he brings the hostage.

296
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,753
<i>Without my permission?</i>

297
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,425
You'll show Yeong-ro to them
without my permission?

298
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,513
Because of the explosion,
Eun's taking an offensive approach.

299
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,890
We should calm him down--

300
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,934
The bombs exploded
because Gang-mu tried to escape!

301
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,478
And even my cover--

302
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,112
Eun should be begging us for forgiveness,
so why do what he demands?

303
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,365
Comrade Kang.

304
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,577
We may be in the South

305
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,579
and occupying this place,

306
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,416
but we're in a third zone where
we must respect both countries' agreement.

307
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,587
In here, the ANSP director
isn't the leader of our enemies.

308
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:11,510
He's a friend who will send us back safely
by fooling the people in the South.

309
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,430
We can't trust him completely, of course.

310
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,473
So

311
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,476
we can't release Yeong-ro.

312
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,395
That's why we need to let him see
that his daughter is safe.

313
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,236
Are you sure
you can handle the consequences?

314
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,242
Yeong-ro's such a daring girl.
You think she won't try something?

315
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,414
The election is in eight days.

316
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,293
Calming Eun Chang-su and buying time
takes priority for now.

317
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:54,010
All right. Do as you wish, then.

318
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,315
<i>How dare you lock me in the basement?</i>

319
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,319
You want to die?

320
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,948
Do you want to die?

321
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,509
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, sir!

322
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,557
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,936
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

324
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,776
He told me to do it,
so I had no other choice.

325
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,531
In the South,
you must do as the ANSP says,

326
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,991
or you die.

327
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,826
Please don't kill us.

328
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,329
We had no idea.

329
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,250
You know why I'm beating you.

330
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,962
How dare you lock me in there?

331
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,096
Let go.

332
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:21,973
Let go!

333
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,684
Stop it!

334
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,878
Stop?

335
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,139
So someone got your back?

336
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,519
You think I'll go easy on you
like comrade Lim?

337
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,315
Eun Yeong-ro.

338
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,068
Follow me.

339
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,867
Get on my nerves again, and I'll kill you.

340
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,870
Eun Yeong-ro.

341
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,312
If Yeong-ro tries to tell them who I am,
you can shoot her.

342
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,189
But don't kill her.

343
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,863
Your father wants to see if you're safe.

344
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,533
My dad?

345
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,581
Let me talk to him over the phone.

346
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,587
Let me talk to him.

347
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,789
Do as I say.

348
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,416
If you say anything stupid,

349
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,586
you'll die.

350
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,147
-Give me the field glasses.
-Here, sir.

351
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,957
Yeong-ro.

352
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,588
Yeong-ro!

353
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,675
Dad.

354
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,810
That's enough.

355
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,729
Dad…

356
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,190
Dad!

357
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,232
Yeong-ro!

358
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,859
Yeong-ro!

359
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,863
I'm okay!

360
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,823
Okay, Yeong-ro!

361
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,451
My brother…

362
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,375
Send Yeong-u off well!

363
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeong-ro!

364
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,546
Come here now.

365
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
Do you want to die?

366
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,605
Come here now.

367
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,781
Save us!

368
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,825
I can't trust anyone!

369
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,539
Hold fire!

370
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,926
Hey! Hold fire!

371
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,052
Hold fire!

372
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,387
Stop shooting!

373
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,774
Don't shoot!

374
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,735
Yeong-ro!

375
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,728
She said she couldn't trust anyone

376
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,730
and was about to say who you were.

377
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,150
We're okay.

378
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,659
I told you to do as I said!

379
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,854
Comrade Lim, move aside.

380
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,693
Comrade Joo.

381
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,070
Lock this brat in the basement.

382
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,364
Don't even give her water.

383
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,350
Go calm Eun Chang-su down first.

384
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,520
Okay.

385
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,410
<i>The spies fired first, so we fired back.
No casualties confirmed.</i>

386
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,456
Why did he even go there? That soft idiot.

387
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,292
You couldn't kill anyone, right?

388
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,629
Anyway, it was an attempt at suppression.
Let's leave it at that.

389
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,507
How dare you fire a gun? How dare you!

390
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
Release my daughter right now!

391
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,679
We can't release her
until our mission's over.

392
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,557
I'm warning you.

393
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,810
If you're planning to break in,

394
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,272
you should be prepared for her death.

395
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,899
You lunatic!

396
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,945
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

397
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,699
If this is how you're playing it,
I have no choice but to talk to your boss.

398
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,711
Talking to their boss or not,
just leave this to me.

399
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,838
Just go see your son off.

400
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,885
I mean, you need to go cry
while burying your son

401
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,471
for us to get more sympathy votes.

402
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,014
Right?

403
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,393
Right!

404
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,186
God damn it!

405
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,189
-You bastard!
-What?

406
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,486
My son died and my daughter's being
held hostage because of this operation!

407
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,950
If this ends up failing,
I'll kill you first!

408
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,622
Stop thinking about the sympathy vote
and take care of that clamor first!

409
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,167
What if this hostage situation
ends up doing us harm?

410
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,506
We must win it by a landslide!

411
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,133
Am I wrong?

412
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,552
You're right.

413
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,970
Understand?

414
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,763
Yes.

415
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,783
<i>Hye-ryeong! Your mom's here!</i>

416
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,995
<i>Let me go see if she's okay!</i>

417
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,289
RESTRICTED

418
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,792
RESTRICTED, SECURITY CHECKPOINT

419
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,174
Why is this happening to us? Seol-hui!

420
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,009
Seol-hui!

421
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,427
Seol-hui!

422
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,764
-Seol-hui! Dad's here!
-If something happened to my daughter,

423
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,307
what will you do?

424
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,768
-This is crazy!
-What are you doing?

425
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,811
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

426
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,229
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

427
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,025
Seol-hui!

428
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,862
I'm in front of Hosu University where
explosions and a gunfight took place.

429
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,991
As you can see, the parents' cries
and rage are filling the place.

430
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,036
The hostages' families are
desperate to know if they're safe,

431
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,165
<i>the ANSP keeps
telling them to trust them and wait.</i>

432
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,753
<i>There is a public uproar
against the government's lousy response</i>

433
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,838
<i>because it might cause more casualties.</i>

434
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,507
Lousy?

435
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,843
How dare he?
Hey, who's that bastard's boss?

436
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,345
I'll go wring his neck.

437
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,722
Leave that to me, sir.

438
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,100
I think you should
calm the parents down first.

439
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,601
<i>…more prompt response</i>

440
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,312
<i>-is needed at the moment…</i>
-God, it's a pain in the neck.

441
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,480
Turn that off.

442
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,243
Hey, are you sure all 34 are safe?

443
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,206
I can prove it if you want.

444
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,752
<i>I'll send in a camcorder,
so film every one of them.</i>

445
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,629
Don't leave out Dr. Kang. Okay?

446
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,423
Have Han-na bring it.

447
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,887
Hello? Have whom? Hey!

448
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,394
I can't even laugh it off anymore.
My goodness.

449
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,857
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

450
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,941
Roll up your sleeve.

451
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,490
You're bleeding!

452
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,511
You still don't take care of your body.

453
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,147
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

454
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,859
He threatened me
saying they can kill us all

455
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:33,407
and that they have an astronomical amount
of money the North can never refuse.

456
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,242
That Nam Tae-il.

457
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,871
So?

458
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,833
Threatening to kill Gang-mu,

459
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,379
I had Han-na obtain proof
of their true intentions.

460
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,216
But the party guaranteed our safe return.

461
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,301
Do you doubt our party?

462
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,932
Stop using my loyalty to the party

463
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,977
to put down my reasonable doubt.

464
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,439
What?

465
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,737
I had to risk my life
trying to abduct Professor Han.

466
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,699
I never imagined it was
for the ruling party of the South

467
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,577
to regain power.

468
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,252
Comrade Park Geum-cheol took
his own life by taking cyanide.

469
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,631
And our agents died
during the engagement in the West Sea.

470
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm sure they never imagined

471
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,886
they died for the South administration

472
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,764
to regain power.

473
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,062
The party will secure
a huge amount of money.

474
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,357
With that money, Geum-cheol and the others

475
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,484
-will become heroes--
-If they do

476
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,113
become heroes of our republic,

477
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,659
I'm sure their families will live well.

478
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
But what parent can live happily

479
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,876
with money they got
for their children's deaths?

480
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,512
I must go back alive.

481
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:24,226
And Eung-cheol must go back alive
to live happily with his mother.

482
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,522
That's all the more reason
why I need to know…

483
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,152
what kind of deal
the North and the South made,

484
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,699
and if that huge amount of money
includes the price of our lives.

485
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,869
I must find out.

486
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:51,962
Comrade.

487
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,636
Do you know who helped me get in here?

488
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,060
The President's favorite guy,
the ruling party's secretary-general,

489
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,144
Nam Tae-il.

490
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,066
He's a future presidential candidate.

491
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,613
To become his doctor…

492
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,448
No.

493
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,577
To have him wrapped around my finger,

494
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,374
it took me as many as 17 years.

495
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,465
And yet,

496
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,010
the party ordered me to risk my life

497
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,722
to come in here and send you,
Taedong River 1, back to the North safely.

498
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,935
Now tell me.

499
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,562
Will the party abandon you guys?

500
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,947
I will not condone any more doubt.

501
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,286
Those who led the escape,
take them to the hall director's office.

502
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,330
Now.

503
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,399
You ANSP agent,
how did you find out about me?

504
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,485
You just came out of that room.

505
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,155
You still don't know?

506
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,742
Through wiretapping?

507
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,661
A hall director of a women's dorm

508
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,707
put a bug on her students
and reported to the ANSP?

509
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,880
How did our lofty hall director
end up spying for the ANSP?

510
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,218
The doctor the ANSP sent in
turned out to be a Northern spy.

511
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,472
I can't hold a candle to you.

512
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,397
We were really going
to let you all go in eight days.

513
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,531
Now that my cover's blown,

514
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,618
I wonder what instructions
the party will give me.

515
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,080
What kind of order regarding security,
Mr. ANSP Agent?

516
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,125
Don't tell me
you'll kill all the students.

517
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,379
If they want to keep everyone quiet,
they'll have to kill every single one.

518
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,301
But do you think
that'll keep your cover hidden forever?

519
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,180
Your true identity
will be revealed someday like me.

520
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,348
And when that happens,

521
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,267
you'll realize you've lived for nothing.

522
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,145
If you kill the innocent students,

523
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,981
how will you carry that guilt
for the rest of your life?

524
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,911
I wonder if you can keep being
hypocritical when faced with death.

525
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,079
Should I test it?

526
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,080
Look.

527
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,375
I'm the one who planned the escape.
I coaxed them into it.

528
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,126
She didn't do anything wrong.

529
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,336
She tried to stop me.

530
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,379
Shut up.

531
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,257
If we must kill a hostage,
you're the first.

532
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,810
Lock them in the basement for now.

533
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,909
Ms. Pi.

534
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,452
Are you okay?

535
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:53,912
Mr. Lee.

536
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,163
Are you okay?

537
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,625
I'm okay.

538
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,806
The Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center

539
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,766
is an undercover spy?

540
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,313
And the ANSP sent her in here.
It means she even penetrated the agency.

541
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,315
You think so too, right?

542
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,776
To keep her cover hidden,

543
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,614
she'll kill all the hostages.

544
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,035
You tried to escape knowing all that?

545
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,954
Should I have done nothing
trusting a frustrating enemy?

546
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,956
So what difference did it make?

547
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,058
Your stupidity has put
the hostages in more danger.

548
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,318
You want to save Yeong-ro too, right?

549
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,991
I want to save her too.

550
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,620
I know you don't want
the hostages to get killed. Neither do I.

551
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,087
She must be still loyal to the North
like any veteran spy would be.

552
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,423
But if she finds out they traded
their agents' lives for money,

553
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,384
I'm sure she'll change her mind.

554
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,803
Bring Han-na in.

555
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,097
She obtained the proof.

556
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,016
I know they locked her up,
but if you specifically ask for her,

557
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,267
they'll have to send her in.

558
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,354
Even if they took her recording,
she must've heard something.

559
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,605
Right?

560
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,400
Bring her in
and listen to what she has to say.

561
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,735
You're the only one I can trust.

562
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,656
Please save the students' lives.
You know they're innocent,

563
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,741
don't you?

564
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:18,974
Help us.

565
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,395
Please.

566
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,154
Lim Soo-ho!

567
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,154
Comrade Lim!

568
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,614
Eung-cheol!

569
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,032
Careful.

570
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,619
My eardrums ruptured.

571
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,621
But it's temporary!

572
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,623
Temporary!

573
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,587
That's a relief!

574
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,131
The partition

575
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,635
must've blocked the blast.

576
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,597
The hostages are
in the prayer room, right?

577
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,267
I keep being a burden to you.

578
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,062
I'm so ashamed, Comrade.

579
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,565
That's not true!

580
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,365
You must be hungry.
Is there anything you want to eat?

581
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,493
Oh, something I want to eat?

582
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:14,089
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

583
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,560
Wait just a moment. I'll get it for you!

584
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,895
No. It's okay!

585
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,279
A camcorder?

586
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,616
They want to see
if all 34 of the hostages are safe.

587
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,162
So Nam Tae-il said
he'll send a camcorder in.

588
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,081
I'll make sure

589
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,500
your true identity doesn't get leaked.

590
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,464
Let them send it in.

591
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,550
But,

592
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,595
don't bring Han-na in.

593
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,477
But it must be Jang Han-na.

594
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,898
I clearly warned you.

595
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,899
I…

596
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,277
am the leader,
and my men's lives depend on me.

597
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,447
Even if I end up being punished
for doubting the party,

598
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,366
I must find out the truth.

599
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,425
Must you?

600
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,680
Answer me!

601
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,595
<i>You bastard. Are you joking with me?</i>

602
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,725
Send Han-na in with a camcorder.
I'll film all 34 of them.

603
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,727
Han-na?

604
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,563
She was caught with Reporter Gal.

605
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,399
Wait, Han-na is not
at the scene right now.

606
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,318
I'll send in another agent.

607
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,196
No. If you want to check their safety,
send in Han-na.

608
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,659
Listen to this guy.
Do you have a thing for her or something?

609
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,329
In 30 minutes, I'll be at the shrine.

610
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,873
In 30 minutes? That's not going to happen!

611
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,918
Give me an hour.
In return, make sure to film Dr. Kang.

612
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,211
<i>Got it?</i>

613
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,550
He hung up on me again. God, this bastard.
I hate this guy.

614
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,440
Han-na!

615
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:01,941
Han-na!

616
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,487
Han-na, wait!

617
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,802
These are the students' dorm records
you asked for.

618
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,113
GYE BUN-OK

619
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,074
HOSU UNIVERSITY TELEPHONE OPERATOR

620
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,951
She's a telephone operator?

621
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,706
She's perfect for watching the hostages.

622
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,876
They're just 34 people.
I can watch them by myself. Why--

623
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,045
You need you to keep an eye on Soo-ho.

624
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,466
Leave it to me
if you need to get rid of Lim Soo-ho.

625
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,556
Don't get ahead of yourself.
That's not what I meant.

626
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,683
I was given a secret order.

627
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,936
To keep a close watch on him

628
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,189
and kill him without mercy
if I sense any change in his ideology.

629
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,483
Kill him without mercy?

630
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,612
Not just observe each other's ideology?

631
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,782
She said Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

632
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,702
Who said that?

633
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,622
The Ministry of State Security,

634
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,334
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

635
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,009
Deputy Director Choi did?

636
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,722
And he seems to know
I'm allowed to kill him.

637
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,268
Despite knowing that, he still
sticks up for Yeong-ro in front of me.

638
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,854
I understand.

639
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,691
Go bring her to me for now.

640
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,161
Choi Su-ryeon…

641
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,249
She's not even in charge of Soo-ho. Why?

642
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,170
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

643
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,715
Moran Hill 1's cover has been blown.
Action needed for security.

644
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,096
If we want Moran Hill 1's cover
to stay hidden,

645
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,599
we must kill all of the hostages.

646
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,851
But the South won't let it slide.

647
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,772
The deal is to let the hostages live
in return for 300 million dollars.

648
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,070
Since when did we

649
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,073
only do as agreed with the South?

650
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,742
Besides, the South's goal is

651
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,244
to win the election,

652
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,579
not to save the hostages' lives.

653
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,167
Because of your son,

654
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,128
I reported to the party that
you were not fit to make a wise decision.

655
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,548
What?

656
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,925
Until the presidential election is over,

657
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,885
I'm the director
of the United Front Department!

658
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,220
I make decisions--

659
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,264
The socialism in Eastern Europe
is in crisis.

660
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:23,059
If this deal goes wrong, our party
will also face a crisis. You know that.

661
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,854
You'll remain as director
of the UFD until the election is over.

662
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,399
But I'll make all operational decisions.

663
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,026
That's the party's decision.
Do you understand?

664
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,319
You…

665
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,366
Don't worry about your son.

666
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,119
If he sacrifices his life for the country,

667
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,663
he'll be titled a Hero of the Republic.

668
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,748
And if that happens,

669
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,419
you'll be acquitted
of failing this mission.

670
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,171
Aren't you happy?

671
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,555
SERVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE!

672
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,480
I should be happy

673
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,650
to be acquitted
thanks to my child's sacrifice?

674
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:18,698
If one of our spies in the dorm
were your son,

675
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,454
would you have made the same decision?

676
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,538
Of course.

677
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,208
As a revolutionary warrior
of our dignified independent country,

678
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,878
that's the most honorable death
anyone could ask for.

679
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,594
Send Taedong River 1 a message.

680
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,682
To protect Moran Hill 1's identity,

681
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,560
the day before the presidential election,

682
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,521
he is to kill all of the hostages.

683
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,900
Right away, Comrade Deputy Director.

684
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,909
Most people wouldn't

685
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,954
even dare to touch Northern spies' money.

686
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,126
I guess you really needed money.

687
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,170
I'm…

688
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,549
I'm so sorry. Please spare me.

689
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,470
Do you want to live?

690
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,893
Then from now on,

691
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,022
manage and keep an eye on the hostages.

692
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,067
Pardon?

693
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,945
You mean,

694
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,697
me?

695
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,158
What? Do you not want to?

696
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,802
I wasn't giving you a choice.

697
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,013
I was ordering you.

698
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,647
I had an older sister.

699
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:02,153
She was smart enough for the country
to send her abroad to study.

700
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,074
So my parents treated me
like some good-for-nothing.

701
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,910
They only…

702
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,622
cared about my sister.

703
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,084
But when she was in Germany,
a Northern spy--

704
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,550
A North Korean persuaded her to join them.

705
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,930
Then while she was questioned
for espionage, she died.

706
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,643
My dad collapsed because of the shock

707
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,895
and has been in the hospital
for seven years.

708
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,856
So if I help you

709
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,235
and end up getting arrested
for espionage too…

710
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:50,535
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

711
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:54,622
But the kids will know.

712
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,167
Well…

713
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,464
As I said, don't worry.

714
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,600
To show that I appreciate
the value of your labor…

715
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,102
Comrade Joo.

716
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,771
Give her ten years' salary all at once.

717
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,197
This will

718
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,825
keep you safe.

719
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:10,197
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

720
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,869
She must be planning to kill all of them.

721
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,080
If

722
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,335
I don't accept this offer…

723
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,882
I'm sure she'll kill me.

724
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,410
Hey, is Jang Han-na not here yet?

725
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,204
What's taking her so long?
She left there ages ago!

726
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,415
Why isn't she here yet?
Do you want to die?

727
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,458
-Do you? I'll kill you!
-No, sir.

728
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,503
Just ten minutes ago,
they said she passed the main gate.

729
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,171
-Ten minutes ago?
-Yes, sir.

730
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,674
Ten minutes? You bastard!

731
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,884
You let your subordinate
walk all over you,

732
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,845
but you want to stand out
in front of cameras?

733
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,722
-Huh? Is that it?
-Mr. An.

734
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,849
This is the Rhine.

735
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,561
Hey, Pi.

736
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,274
<i>Pi!</i>

737
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:13,738
She cut me off.

738
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,156
She cut me off!

739
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,366
How dare she!

740
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,869
You bastard! Go bring Han-na now!

741
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,370
Bring Han-na!

742
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,039
Damn it.

743
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,498
Hey!

744
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,793
God damn it!

745
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,558
This belongs to Pi?

746
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,501
<i>Was it</i>

747
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,754
because of Yeong-ro?

748
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,633
Since she's the director's daughter,

749
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,385
they made you
a tapping room for security reasons?

750
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,222
In case he joined a protest,

751
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,183
they asked you to watch her?

752
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,604
Did my agency threaten you
to make you do that,

753
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,689
Ms. Pi?

754
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,945
Ms. Pi.

755
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,573
-Was it really because of me?
-Of course not.

756
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,203
Don't try so hard to understand.

757
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,164
An inflexible stickler for the rules

758
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,084
turned out to be spying for the ANSP.

759
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,836
That's the truth.

760
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,755
But…

761
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,093
Jeong-min's been protesting,
but you let her be.

762
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,400
Repeat after me.

763
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,570
Spies come in chaos,

764
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,738
and prosperity comes in peace.

765
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:23,868
You tenacious wench.

766
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,870
How many more times do I have to tell you?

767
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,497
If we… No, if I say

768
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,001
you're a spy, then you are a spy.

769
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,378
A trial? That's just a formality.

770
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,592
What are you doing? Look down properly!

771
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,513
If you don't change your mind,

772
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,974
you'll get swept away down there

773
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,351
without a trace.

774
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:56,066
It's so cold, isn't it?
Let's make it quick.

775
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,862
All right. You've been

776
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,906
to Pyongyang.

777
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,201
With your boyfriend. Right?

778
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,375
As I make someone a spy,

779
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,504
I feel like I'm lovesick.

780
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,845
I've been only watching you
for the last few months.

781
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,933
I've been working so hard
to make you a spy!

782
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,478
You're a spy, right?

783
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,071
You're the one, aren't you?

784
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,281
You're the one who went to Pyongyang

785
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,617
with your lover! Who else would it be?

786
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,411
Tell me!

787
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,208
I'll tell you.

788
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,795
I'll tell you everything! I swear!

789
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,762
I'll tell you.

790
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,889
I'll tell you everything!

791
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,224
I swear!

792
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,649
I get the feeling

793
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:22,319
that you have
an ill-fated relationship with the ANSP.

794
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:26,156
A relationship? Being pestered
by evil men isn't a relationship.

795
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:33,330
After framing two innocent people
for espionage and getting them killed,

796
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,458
you people were awarded medals
and prize money!

797
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,129
For serving the country loyally!
You think I'll ever forget it?

798
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,926
For serving…

799
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,025
The one who tortured me the most cruelly…

800
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:08,157
shed tears in front of the people
on the day I was released.

801
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,620
With the look on his face just like yours.

802
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,548
Starting today, Bun-ok

803
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,885
will manage and watch all of you.

804
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,596
-What? Why?
-She'll manage us?

805
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:13,889
What's going on?

806
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:14,890
Why Gizzard?

807
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:17,226
Quiet.

808
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,438
You must obey Bun-ok's orders.
Don't talk back to her.

809
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,816
Whoever disobeys her

810
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,402
is disobeying me.

811
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:28,946
So I'll kill them without mercy.

812
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,252
That vicious wench.

813
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,974
-What's going on?
-Tell me about it.

814
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:57,933
Bun-ok.

815
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,726
-What does she think she is?
-Are you

816
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,521
on the spies' side now?

817
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,232
On their side?

818
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:06,817
Watch what you say.

819
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:10,070
I'm just supervising you in Pi's place.

820
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,207
Supervising, whatever.

821
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,750
Who is she to supervise us?

822
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,919
What are we, kindergarteners?

823
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,971
You've now even become
a lackey for the Northern spies?

824
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,391
Listen. This is way worse than stealing.

825
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,602
Once we're all released,

826
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:44,104
I'm sure you'll go to jail
for helping the spies.

827
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:46,815
People will throw stones at your family.

828
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,491
That crazy wench.

829
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,339
Yes.

830
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,424
I'm a thieving wench.

831
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:18,847
Countless rings that you got
from this guy and that guy.

832
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:23,143
Pairs of dress shoes
you bought but wouldn't wear.

833
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,271
Designer clothes you wore once
on a blind date and forgot about.

834
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,276
I'm a thief who didn't feel guilty

835
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,487
about stealing them.

836
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,451
What are you jabbering about?

837
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,620
Boasting about stealing?

838
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,414
When did you ever treat me like a human?

839
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,167
You treated me like some machine

840
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:51,630
that took calls for you without any
emotions or desires, and laughed at me.

841
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,342
Like I wasn't human
since I wasn't a college student.

842
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,512
-When did we do that?
-We didn't.

843
01:15:58,595 --> 01:15:59,930
-No, we didn't.
-No way.

844
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,939
I'll return the favor.

845
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:14,528
See how it feels like
to be bullied by Gizzard.

846
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,406
You should feel it.

847
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,076
That's only fair.

848
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:22,703
Don't you agree?

849
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,373
Ko Hye-ja?

850
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,046
Hands over your head with your face down.

851
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,552
Heads down, all of you!

852
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:01,074
Film every single hostage
including the doctor.

853
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,743
An hour will be enough, right?

854
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,995
I'll radio you once I'm done.

855
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,539
What about the proof?

856
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,172
I need to see my team leader first.

857
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,466
Your fiancé is safe, so don't worry.

858
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,218
It'll only take a minute.

859
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,555
I risked my life to get this.
You can't even allow me a minute?

860
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,103
All right, fine. I'll just give it to you.

861
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,825
In order to obtain this, a person is

862
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,204
dying in the interrogation room
of the ANSP.

863
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:49,998
So listen to it carefully.

864
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,918
I've brought this to you

865
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,337
because I think you're different

866
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,631
from Geum-cheol
who killed himself with cyanide.

867
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,351
Hey.

868
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:14,398
Shouldn't you at least give water
to Yeong-ro and Ms. Pi?

869
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,818
How long will you keep us tied up?

870
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:27,661
Comrade Kang wants to see you.

871
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:29,913
Tell her I'll radio the party first.

872
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,292
Lim Soo-ho.

873
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,545
We're rats in a trap!

874
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:38,630
Rats in a trap.

875
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,733
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

876
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:02,070
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

877
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,865
<i>and saving the hostages. Right?</i>

878
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,662
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

879
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:15,167
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies.</i>

880
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:22,799
<i>Enemies are everywhere.</i>

881
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,595
Those who have power
all thanks to their family name

882
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,805
have their guns pointed at me.

883
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:33,393
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

884
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,895
Don't forget that.

885
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,734
If my father has been suspended…

886
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:43,236
<i>Right.</i>

887
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,405
<i>That must be it.</i>

888
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,366
<i>It must have been someone else's decision.</i>

889
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:51,453
<i>There's no way my father would…</i>

890
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,750
Ryesong River 1, can you hear me?

891
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,045
<i>Ryesong River 1, loud and clear.</i>

892
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:46,383
Any change in the location
of Mount Myohyang?

893
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,325
What were you doing?

894
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,996
I radioed the message about your cover

895
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:18,373
being blown and asked what to do about it.

896
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,750
But there was no reply,
so I was about to do it again.

897
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,547
It's an important matter,

898
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,841
so it must be taking them
quite a while to discuss.

899
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,093
Oh, right.

900
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,806
Does the party know
the ANSP director's daughter is here?

901
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,143
They do.

902
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:24,648
This is Eun Chang-su.

903
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,776
You know my daughter's
being held hostage, right?

904
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:33,198
Could you order your agents
to release my daughter right away?

905
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,910
Then meet our demand first.

906
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,038
Send us 300 million dollars in three days.

907
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,247
Pardon?

908
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,709
But you agreed to receive it
after the operation was over.

909
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,087
If you don't send it to us in three days,

910
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,297
all of the hostages will die.

911
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:50,382
What?

912
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,509
Are you kidding me?

913
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,136
Remember. You have three days.

914
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:00,517
Hello?

915
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:01,601
Hello?

916
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,237
KILL ALL HOSTAGES DAY BEFORE ELECTION

917
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,887
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

918
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,607
God damn it!

919
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,057
<i>No change in Mount Myohyang's location.</i>

920
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,477
No change in Mount Myohyang's location.

921
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,356
<i>My father is still
the director of the UFD.</i>

922
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:15,944
<i>Then he has…</i>

923
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,114
<i>abandoned me?</i>

924
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,633
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

925
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:41,719
My sister's sick. Please help her!

926
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:46,975
Come on.

927
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,477
-We have no time for that.
-Yes, sir.

928
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,481
My father died trying to save other people
when the mine collapsed.

929
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:58,319
So in my father's place,
shouldn't the party save my sister?

930
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,952
What are you doing? Go away!

931
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,289
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

932
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:12,125
We even got kicked out
of the train because we had no pass!

933
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,880
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

934
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,840
-Come here!
-Please help us!

935
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,092
Please! My sister's sick!

936
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,052
Please help her!

937
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,767
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

938
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,103
Repay me?

939
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:33,521
How?

940
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:36,107
I will do anything.

941
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,277
If you tell me to die, I will!

942
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:18,483
You're hungry, aren't you?

943
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:22,528
This won't do. Demand some more food.

944
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:31,955
Stand up.

945
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:44,842
Put your hands up.

946
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,132
You son of a b****.

947
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:32,557
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

948
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,102
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

949
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,688
<i>The more likely
the ruling party is to win the election,</i>

950
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:40,106
<i>the less likely we're to live.</i>

951
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:43,067
<i>I feel like I can hear
the approval rating going up.</i>

952
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:48,406
How is it in there?

953
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:49,449
Actually,

954
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:51,868
Lim Soo-ho the spy…

955
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,870
Who ordered to kill me?

956
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,622
<i>You were a card to discard to begin with.</i>

957
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,082
Be careful.

958
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,043
<i>If you don't send
300 million in three days…</i>

959
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,170
<i>Bun-ok…</i>

960
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,213
<i>Your daughter will be killed first.</i>

961
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,467
<i>I must get out of here alive.</i>

962
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:10,762
<i>Yeong-ro.</i>

963
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,563
BONUS

964
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:22,315
I'll check the food first.

965
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:23,358
6 MONTHS AGO

966
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:25,109
You may go in.

967
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:55,348
My, my. You guys did
a variety of drugs here.

968
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:58,643
Look who's here.

969
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,813
Isn't this Ms. Lee Yu-rim,
the most popular singer?

970
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,231
Nice to meet you!

971
01:30:03,606 --> 01:30:05,483
Miss, over there. Strike a pose!

972
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:07,026
Good.

973
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,154
Our handsome Crown Prince,
strike a pose too!

974
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,614
Great.

975
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,990
Hey, you two,

976
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,492
you look great.

977
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,828
Damn it!

978
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,704
Pose!

979
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,665
Great.

980
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,960
Hey. Kick him out.

981
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:25,628
Guard…

982
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,382
Guard!

983
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,857
This?

984
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,692
Are you insane?

985
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:20,558
Whether the President's son does meth
or his wife cheats,

986
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,227
we'll take care of it, so stay out of it.

987
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,104
Who are you? How did you know I was here?

988
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,531
There are so many
other news stories to write.

989
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:38,409
So stop here.

990
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,206
No… Don't do it!
