00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.802 line:85.83%,end
These are the students' dorm records
you asked for.

00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:48.113 line:85.83%,end
GYE BUN-OK

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:51.074 line:85.83%,end
HOSU UNIVERSITY TELEPHONE OPERATOR

00:56:51.157 --> 00:56:52.951 line:85.83%,end
She's a telephone operator?

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.706 line:85.83%,end
She's perfect for watching the hostages.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.876 line:85.83%,end
They're just 34 people.
I can watch them by myself. Why--

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.045 line:85.83%,end
You need you to keep an eye on Soo-ho.

00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:08.466 line:85.83%,end
Leave it to me
if you need to get rid of Lim Soo-ho.

00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:14.556 line:85.83%,end
Don't get ahead of yourself.
That's not what I meant.

00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:16.683 line:85.83%,end
I was given a secret order.

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.936 line:85.83%,end
To keep a close watch on him

00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:23.189 line:85.83%,end
and kill him without mercy
if I sense any change in his ideology.

00:57:23.815 --> 00:57:25.483 line:85.83%,end
Kill him without mercy?

00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:29.612 line:85.83%,end
Not just observe each other's ideology?

00:57:29.696 --> 00:57:32.782 line:85.83%,end
She said Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:35.702 line:85.83%,end
Who said that?

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.622 line:85.83%,end
The Ministry of State Security,

00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:43.334 line:85.83%,end
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:51.009 line:85.83%,end
Deputy Director Choi did?

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.722 line:85.83%,end
And he seems to know
I'm allowed to kill him.

00:57:56.431 --> 00:58:00.268 line:85.83%,end
Despite knowing that, he still
sticks up for Yeong-ro in front of me.

00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:02.854 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.691 line:85.83%,end
Go bring her to me for now.

00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:18.161 line:85.83%,end
Choi Su-ryeon…

00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:23.249 line:85.83%,end
She's not even in charge of Soo-ho. Why?

00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:27.170 line:85.83%,end
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:30.715 line:85.83%,end
Moran Hill 1's cover has been blown.
Action needed for security.

00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:37.096 line:85.83%,end
If we want Moran Hill 1's cover
to stay hidden,

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.599 line:85.83%,end
we must kill all of the hostages.

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:41.851 line:85.83%,end
But the South won't let it slide.

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:45.772 line:85.83%,end
The deal is to let the hostages live
in return for 300 million dollars.

00:58:50.735 --> 00:58:52.070 line:85.83%,end
Since when did we

00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:55.073 line:85.83%,end
only do as agreed with the South?

00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.742 line:85.83%,end
Besides, the South's goal is

00:58:57.825 --> 00:58:59.244 line:85.83%,end
to win the election,

00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:01.579 line:85.83%,end
not to save the hostages' lives.

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.167 line:85.83%,end
Because of your son,

00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.128 line:85.83%,end
I reported to the party that
you were not fit to make a wise decision.

00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:11.548 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:13.925 line:85.83%,end
Until the presidential election is over,

00:59:14.008 --> 00:59:15.885 line:85.83%,end
I'm the director
of the United Front Department!

00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:17.220 line:85.83%,end
I make decisions--

00:59:17.303 --> 00:59:19.264 line:85.83%,end
The socialism in Eastern Europe
is in crisis.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:23.059 line:85.83%,end
If this deal goes wrong, our party
will also face a crisis. You know that.

00:59:23.851 --> 00:59:26.854 line:85.83%,end
You'll remain as director
of the UFD until the election is over.

00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:29.399 line:85.83%,end
But I'll make all operational decisions.

00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:32.026 line:85.83%,end
That's the party's decision.
Do you understand?

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:33.319 line:85.83%,end
You…

00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:38.366 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry about your son.

00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:41.119 line:85.83%,end
If he sacrifices his life for the country,

00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:43.663 line:85.83%,end
he'll be titled a Hero of the Republic.

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.748 line:85.83%,end
And if that happens,

00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:49.419 line:85.83%,end
you'll be acquitted
of failing this mission.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.171 line:85.83%,end
Aren't you happy?

00:59:56.551 --> 01:00:00.555 line:85.83%,end
SERVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE!

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.480 line:85.83%,end
I should be happy

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.650 line:85.83%,end
to be acquitted
thanks to my child's sacrifice?

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:18.698 line:85.83%,end
If one of our spies in the dorm
were your son,

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:24.454 line:85.83%,end
would you have made the same decision?

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:25.538 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:29.208 line:85.83%,end
As a revolutionary warrior
of our dignified independent country,

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.878 line:85.83%,end
that's the most honorable death
anyone could ask for.

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:39.594 line:85.83%,end
Send Taedong River 1 a message.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:44.682 line:85.83%,end
To protect Moran Hill 1's identity,

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.560 line:85.83%,end
the day before the presidential election,

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.521 line:85.83%,end
he is to kill all of the hostages.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:53.900 line:85.83%,end
Right away, Comrade Deputy Director.
