01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:45.926 line:85.83%,end
For serving…

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.025 line:85.83%,end
The one who tortured me the most cruelly…

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:08.157 line:85.83%,end
shed tears in front of the people
on the day I was released.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.620 line:85.83%,end
With the look on his face just like yours.

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:06.548 line:85.83%,end
Starting today, Bun-ok

01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:09.885 line:85.83%,end
will manage and watch all of you.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:12.596 line:85.83%,end
-What? Why?
-She'll manage us?

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:13.889 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:14.890 line:85.83%,end
Why Gizzard?

01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.226 line:85.83%,end
Quiet.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:21.438 line:85.83%,end
You must obey Bun-ok's orders.
Don't talk back to her.

01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:23.816 line:85.83%,end
Whoever disobeys her

01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:26.402 line:85.83%,end
is disobeying me.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.946 line:85.83%,end
So I'll kill them without mercy.

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.252 line:85.83%,end
That vicious wench.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:56.974 line:85.83%,end
-What's going on?
-Tell me about it.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:57.933 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

01:13:58.016 --> 01:13:59.726 line:85.83%,end
-What does she think she is?
-Are you

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.521 line:85.83%,end
on the spies' side now?

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.232 line:85.83%,end
On their side?

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:06.817 line:85.83%,end
Watch what you say.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.070 line:85.83%,end
I'm just supervising you in Pi's place.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.207 line:85.83%,end
Supervising, whatever.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.750 line:85.83%,end
Who is she to supervise us?

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:25.919 line:85.83%,end
What are we, kindergarteners?

01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:35.971 line:85.83%,end
You've now even become
a lackey for the Northern spies?

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:39.391 line:85.83%,end
Listen. This is way worse than stealing.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.602 line:85.83%,end
Once we're all released,

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:44.104 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure you'll go to jail
for helping the spies.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.815 line:85.83%,end
People will throw stones at your family.

01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:55.491 line:85.83%,end
That crazy wench.

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:10.339 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.424 line:85.83%,end
I'm a thieving wench.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:18.847 line:85.83%,end
Countless rings that you got
from this guy and that guy.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.143 line:85.83%,end
Pairs of dress shoes
you bought but wouldn't wear.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:26.271 line:85.83%,end
Designer clothes you wore once
on a blind date and forgot about.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.276 line:85.83%,end
I'm a thief who didn't feel guilty

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.487 line:85.83%,end
about stealing them.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:39.451 line:85.83%,end
What are you jabbering about?

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.620 line:85.83%,end
Boasting about stealing?

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:44.414 line:85.83%,end
When did you ever treat me like a human?

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:47.167 line:85.83%,end
You treated me like some machine

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:51.630 line:85.83%,end
that took calls for you without any
emotions or desires, and laughed at me.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.342 line:85.83%,end
Like I wasn't human
since I wasn't a college student.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.512 line:85.83%,end
-When did we do that?
-We didn't.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:15:59.930 line:85.83%,end
-No, we didn't.
-No way.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:08.939 line:85.83%,end
I'll return the favor.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:14.528 line:85.83%,end
See how it feels like
to be bullied by Gizzard.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.406 line:85.83%,end
You should feel it.

01:16:19.491 --> 01:16:21.076 line:85.83%,end
That's only fair.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:22.703 line:85.83%,end
Don't you agree?

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:26.373 line:85.83%,end
Ko Hye-ja?

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.046 line:85.83%,end
Hands over your head with your face down.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.552 line:85.83%,end
Heads down, all of you!
