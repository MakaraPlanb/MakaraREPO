00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:12.511 line:85.83%,end
You still don't take care of your body.

00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:23.147 line:85.83%,end
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.859 line:85.83%,end
He threatened me
saying they can kill us all

00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:33.407 line:85.83%,end
and that they have an astronomical amount
of money the North can never refuse.

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.242 line:85.83%,end
That Nam Tae-il.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:38.871 line:85.83%,end
So?

00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:42.833 line:85.83%,end
Threatening to kill Gang-mu,

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:47.379 line:85.83%,end
I had Han-na obtain proof
of their true intentions.

00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:50.216 line:85.83%,end
But the party guaranteed our safe return.

00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.301 line:85.83%,end
Do you doubt our party?

00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:57.932 line:85.83%,end
Stop using my loyalty to the party

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.977 line:85.83%,end
to put down my reasonable doubt.

00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:05.439 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:11.737 line:85.83%,end
I had to risk my life
trying to abduct Professor Han.

00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:15.699 line:85.83%,end
I never imagined it was
for the ruling party of the South

00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:18.577 line:85.83%,end
to regain power.

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:26.252 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Park Geum-cheol took
his own life by taking cyanide.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.631 line:85.83%,end
And our agents died
during the engagement in the West Sea.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:33.509 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure they never imagined

00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:35.886 line:85.83%,end
they died for the South administration

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.764 line:85.83%,end
to regain power.

00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:45.062 line:85.83%,end
The party will secure
a huge amount of money.

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:48.357 line:85.83%,end
With that money, Geum-cheol and the others

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.484 line:85.83%,end
-will become heroes--
-If they do

00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:54.113 line:85.83%,end
become heroes of our republic,

00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:58.659 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure their families will live well.

00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:05.165 line:85.83%,end
But what parent can live happily

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.876 line:85.83%,end
with money they got
for their children's deaths?

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.512 line:85.83%,end
I must go back alive.

00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:24.226 line:85.83%,end
And Eung-cheol must go back alive
to live happily with his mother.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.522 line:85.83%,end
That's all the more reason
why I need to know…

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.152 line:85.83%,end
what kind of deal
the North and the South made,

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.699 line:85.83%,end
and if that huge amount of money
includes the price of our lives.

00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:41.869 line:85.83%,end
I must find out.

00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:51.962 line:85.83%,end
Comrade.

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:58.636 line:85.83%,end
Do you know who helped me get in here?

00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:06.060 line:85.83%,end
The President's favorite guy,
the ruling party's secretary-general,

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.144 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il.

00:44:10.022 --> 00:44:12.066 line:85.83%,end
He's a future presidential candidate.

00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:17.613 line:85.83%,end
To become his doctor…

00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:19.448 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:23.577 line:85.83%,end
To have him wrapped around my finger,

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:28.374 line:85.83%,end
it took me as many as 17 years.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.465 line:85.83%,end
And yet,

00:44:37.716 --> 00:44:40.010 line:85.83%,end
the party ordered me to risk my life

00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:43.722 line:85.83%,end
to come in here and send you,
Taedong River 1, back to the North safely.

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:47.935 line:85.83%,end
Now tell me.

00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.562 line:85.83%,end
Will the party abandon you guys?

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.947 line:85.83%,end
I will not condone any more doubt.

00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:06.286 line:85.83%,end
Those who led the escape,
take them to the hall director's office.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:08.330 line:85.83%,end
Now.

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:35.399 line:85.83%,end
You ANSP agent,
how did you find out about me?

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.485 line:85.83%,end
You just came out of that room.

00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:41.155 line:85.83%,end
You still don't know?

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:44.742 line:85.83%,end
Through wiretapping?

00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:47.661 line:85.83%,end
A hall director of a women's dorm

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:51.707 line:85.83%,end
put a bug on her students
and reported to the ANSP?

00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:57.880 line:85.83%,end
How did our lofty hall director
end up spying for the ANSP?

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:03.218 line:85.83%,end
The doctor the ANSP sent in
turned out to be a Northern spy.

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:06.472 line:85.83%,end
I can't hold a candle to you.
