00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.467 line:85.83%,end
In any case,

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.763 line:85.83%,end
I owe you big time.

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.473 line:85.83%,end
Don't mention it.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:26.558 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP exists

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.852 line:85.83%,end
to protect sovereignty.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:31.647 line:85.83%,end
Sure.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:36.944 line:85.83%,end
Then it's also your job to protect me
to make my dad feel at ease, right?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:40.656 line:85.83%,end
You are right, sir.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:46.245 line:85.83%,end
That's the single
most important job for me,

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:48.080 line:85.83%,end
An Gyeong-hui.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.207 line:85.83%,end
Right.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:54.461 line:85.83%,end
It's him!

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.257 line:85.83%,end
He was quite clumsy back then.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.509 line:85.83%,end
Hey, give me the phone.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.976 line:85.83%,end
<i>You bastard. Are you an idiot?</i>

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.852 line:85.83%,end
Did you forget about the plan?

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.273 line:85.83%,end
I told you it must look like
you guys are making this drag on!

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:17.734 line:85.83%,end
But what do you do?
You go ahead and blow up bombs?

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:19.736 line:85.83%,end
Maybe I should've let them go.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.865 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP team leader was
about to escape with all of the hostages.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.160 line:85.83%,end
God, Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.245 line:85.83%,end
-Salute!
-Salute!

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.000 line:85.83%,end
You're meddling here again?

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.460 line:85.83%,end
-Again? Huh?
-Get the suppression team ready.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.212 line:85.83%,end
All units stand by!

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:43.302 line:85.83%,end
Lee Gang-mu, one of your men, was
about to escape with all of the hostages,

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.804 line:85.83%,end
so they had no choice
but to blow up the bombs.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:48.640 line:85.83%,end
This is Eun Chang-su.

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:51.977 line:85.83%,end
Once the suppression team goes in,
you'll all die in five minutes.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:56.189 line:85.83%,end
So tell me the truth.
Is Yeong-ro safe? And any casualties?

00:21:57.441 --> 00:22:00.068 line:85.83%,end
Calm down. I know this is a scheme.

00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:04.948 line:85.83%,end
All of the hostages
including your daughter are all safe.

00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:09.202 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully. Seeing how
you unexpectedly blew up some bombs,

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.413 line:85.83%,end
I can't let my daughter stay there.
Release her now.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:13.707 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:15.709 line:85.83%,end
Are you insane?

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:18.879 line:85.83%,end
Are you going to show
rescuing your daughter only

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:20.881 line:85.83%,end
when all of the press cameras are here?

00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.799 line:85.83%,end
You were against it earlier!

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:27.054 line:85.83%,end
Our agreement doesn't say
my daughter must be held hostage!

00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.604 line:85.83%,end
What about you?
You said we'd just rescue my daughter

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:38.190 line:85.83%,end
if things got dangerous.
Why are you so worked up?

00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:41.026 line:85.83%,end
But we need some kind of insurance.

00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:45.364 line:85.83%,end
In case the word gets out.

00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:51.620 line:85.83%,end
If they find out your daughter is
also being held hostage,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.164 line:85.83%,end
who'll suspect it might be a scheme?

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.249 line:85.83%,end
You son of a--

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:09.930 line:85.83%,end
I, the ANSP director,
guarantee your safe return.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.307 line:85.83%,end
So release my daughter right now.

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:17.479 line:85.83%,end
To return safely,
we need your daughter here.

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.773 line:85.83%,end
Release her right this instant!

00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:22.984 line:85.83%,end
Be patient. I will in eight days.

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.529 line:85.83%,end
You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.449 line:85.83%,end
I can prove that your daughter is safe.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:32.911 line:85.83%,end
All right. In exactly five minutes,

00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.122 line:85.83%,end
bring her to the cafeteria.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.751 line:85.83%,end
She'll stand by the windows in the lounge.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:44.673 line:85.83%,end
The press is watching us. They'll
see me only checking my daughter's safety.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.675 line:85.83%,end
Bring her to the cafeteria!

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.510 line:85.83%,end
Or I'll send in the suppression team!

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.057 line:85.83%,end
Get the snipers ready. Tell them to
kill him as soon as he brings my daughter!

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:55.892 line:85.83%,end
Sniper team, this is Captain.

00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:58.186 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?
Are you going to break in?

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.857 line:85.83%,end
They even blew up bombs. We should act.
If we hesitate,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.986 line:85.83%,end
people will find it suspicious.
They might find out it's a scheme!

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:08.363 line:85.83%,end
That's just what you think.

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.867 line:85.83%,end
I already told our boss
this will drag on until the election.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.826 line:85.83%,end
Order them!

00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:17.664 line:85.83%,end
Kill Taedong River 1
as soon as he brings the hostage.

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.753 line:85.83%,end
<i>Without my permission?</i>

00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:28.425 line:85.83%,end
You'll show Yeong-ro to them
without my permission?

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:33.513 line:85.83%,end
Because of the explosion,
Eun's taking an offensive approach.

00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:34.890 line:85.83%,end
We should calm him down--

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.934 line:85.83%,end
The bombs exploded
because Gang-mu tried to escape!

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.478 line:85.83%,end
And even my cover--

00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:49.112 line:85.83%,end
Eun should be begging us for forgiveness,
so why do what he demands?

00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:52.365 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.577 line:85.83%,end
We may be in the South

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.579 line:85.83%,end
and occupying this place,

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.416 line:85.83%,end
but we're in a third zone where
we must respect both countries' agreement.

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:05.587 line:85.83%,end
In here, the ANSP director
isn't the leader of our enemies.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:11.510 line:85.83%,end
He's a friend who will send us back safely
by fooling the people in the South.

00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:15.430 line:85.83%,end
We can't trust him completely, of course.

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:16.473 line:85.83%,end
So
