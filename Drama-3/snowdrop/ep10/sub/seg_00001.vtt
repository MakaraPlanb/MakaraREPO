00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.267 line:85.83%,end
Sit.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:30.121 line:85.83%,end
It was you, wasn't it?
Where did you hide the money bag?

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:31.706 line:85.83%,end
Is that important right now?

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.666 line:85.83%,end
Can't you see they failed to escape?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.001 line:85.83%,end
You little…

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.961 line:85.83%,end
I don't know where it is either.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.047 line:85.83%,end
I know you hid it.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.049 line:85.83%,end
Do you have a death wish?

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.051 line:85.83%,end
Why don't we go get the bag now?

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.553 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.141 line:85.83%,end
Damn it!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.231 line:85.83%,end
I'll go check the second floor.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:08.368 line:85.83%,end
You little bastard.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:22.757 line:85.83%,end
Follow me.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.303 line:85.83%,end
Isn't that Sang-beom?

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.848 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom, what's going on?

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.184 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.814 line:85.83%,end
What did you do this time?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.233 line:85.83%,end
Where's Eung-cheol?

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.198 line:85.83%,end
Once everything's settled,
block the secret passage first.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.116 line:85.83%,end
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:51.953 line:85.83%,end
You fool.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.759 line:85.83%,end
We released 30 hostages,
yet you tried to escape?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.971 line:85.83%,end
Who put you up to it?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.182 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP?

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.019 line:85.83%,end
Or the hall director?

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.315 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:25.361 line:85.83%,end
It was me.

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.197 line:85.83%,end
The students just did as I said.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.450 line:85.83%,end
Is that so? You.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.578 line:85.83%,end
Were you hiding as she told you?

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:43.796 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.009 line:85.83%,end
That's not true.
I suggested escaping first.

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:49.594 line:85.83%,end
Be quiet, Yeong-ro.

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.596 line:85.83%,end
My brother's being buried today.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.347 line:85.83%,end
I wanted to go there.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.016 line:85.83%,end
I really wanted to be there,

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.726 line:85.83%,end
so I asked her.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.896 line:85.83%,end
It was you again.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.356 line:85.83%,end
Because of you…

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.777 line:85.83%,end
<i>my cover's been blown.</i>

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.532 line:85.83%,end
Are you really a Northern spy?

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:15.453 line:85.83%,end
Trying to help us and caring for us…

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.663 line:85.83%,end
Were you putting on an act?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.675 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.344 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:20.935 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.397 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.067 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.402 line:85.83%,end
Wake up, Eung-cheol!

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:32.154 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:44.584 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol! Wake up!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.086 line:85.83%,end
Comrade!

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.756 line:85.83%,end
I can't hear you! Please speak louder!

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.803 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol. Can you get up?

00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:58.222 line:85.83%,end
Hold me!

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.934 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.
