00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:15.397 line:85.83%,end
We were really going
to let you all go in eight days.

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:24.531 line:85.83%,end
Now that my cover's blown,

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.618 line:85.83%,end
I wonder what instructions
the party will give me.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:32.080 line:85.83%,end
What kind of order regarding security,
Mr. ANSP Agent?

00:46:32.998 --> 00:46:35.125 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me
you'll kill all the students.

00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:39.379 line:85.83%,end
If they want to keep everyone quiet,
they'll have to kill every single one.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:44.301 line:85.83%,end
But do you think
that'll keep your cover hidden forever?

00:46:45.093 --> 00:46:48.180 line:85.83%,end
Your true identity
will be revealed someday like me.

00:46:48.263 --> 00:46:49.348 line:85.83%,end
And when that happens,

00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:52.267 line:85.83%,end
you'll realize you've lived for nothing.

00:46:53.018 --> 00:46:55.145 line:85.83%,end
If you kill the innocent students,

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:57.981 line:85.83%,end
how will you carry that guilt
for the rest of your life?

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:10.911 line:85.83%,end
I wonder if you can keep being
hypocritical when faced with death.

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.079 line:85.83%,end
Should I test it?

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.080 line:85.83%,end
Look.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.375 line:85.83%,end
I'm the one who planned the escape.
I coaxed them into it.

00:47:16.458 --> 00:47:18.126 line:85.83%,end
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.336 line:85.83%,end
She tried to stop me.

00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:20.379 line:85.83%,end
Shut up.

00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:23.257 line:85.83%,end
If we must kill a hostage,
you're the first.

00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:34.810 line:85.83%,end
Lock them in the basement for now.

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:50.909 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.452 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:53.912 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:55.163 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:58.625 line:85.83%,end
I'm okay.

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.806 line:85.83%,end
The Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.766 line:85.83%,end
is an undercover spy?

00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:19.313 line:85.83%,end
And the ANSP sent her in here.
It means she even penetrated the agency.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:21.315 line:85.83%,end
You think so too, right?

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.776 line:85.83%,end
To keep her cover hidden,

00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:28.614 line:85.83%,end
she'll kill all the hostages.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:33.035 line:85.83%,end
You tried to escape knowing all that?

00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:35.954 line:85.83%,end
Should I have done nothing
trusting a frustrating enemy?

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:37.956 line:85.83%,end
So what difference did it make?

00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:56.058 line:85.83%,end
Your stupidity has put
the hostages in more danger.

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:06.318 line:85.83%,end
You want to save Yeong-ro too, right?

00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:12.991 line:85.83%,end
I want to save her too.

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.620 line:85.83%,end
I know you don't want
the hostages to get killed. Neither do I.

00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:25.087 line:85.83%,end
She must be still loyal to the North
like any veteran spy would be.

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:28.423 line:85.83%,end
But if she finds out they traded
their agents' lives for money,

00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:30.384 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure she'll change her mind.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:32.803 line:85.83%,end
Bring Han-na in.

00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:35.097 line:85.83%,end
She obtained the proof.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.016 line:85.83%,end
I know they locked her up,
but if you specifically ask for her,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.267 line:85.83%,end
they'll have to send her in.

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:42.354 line:85.83%,end
Even if they took her recording,
she must've heard something.

00:49:42.437 --> 00:49:43.605 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:46.400 line:85.83%,end
Bring her in
and listen to what she has to say.

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:48.735 line:85.83%,end
You're the only one I can trust.

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.656 line:85.83%,end
Please save the students' lives.
You know they're innocent,

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:54.741 line:85.83%,end
don't you?

00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:18.974 line:85.83%,end
Help us.

00:50:22.227 --> 00:50:23.395 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:32.154 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho!
