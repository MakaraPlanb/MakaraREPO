00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:53.693 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:56.070 line:85.83%,end
Lock this brat in the basement.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.364 line:85.83%,end
Don't even give her water.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:26.350 line:85.83%,end
Go calm Eun Chang-su down first.

00:36:28.477 --> 00:36:29.520 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:44.410 line:85.83%,end
<i>The spies fired first, so we fired back.
No casualties confirmed.</i>

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.456 line:85.83%,end
Why did he even go there? That soft idiot.

00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:51.292 line:85.83%,end
You couldn't kill anyone, right?

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:54.629 line:85.83%,end
Anyway, it was an attempt at suppression.
Let's leave it at that.

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.507 line:85.83%,end
How dare you fire a gun? How dare you!

00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.176 line:85.83%,end
Release my daughter right now!

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.679 line:85.83%,end
We can't release her
until our mission's over.

00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:06.557 line:85.83%,end
I'm warning you.

00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:09.810 line:85.83%,end
If you're planning to break in,

00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:13.272 line:85.83%,end
you should be prepared for her death.

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:14.899 line:85.83%,end
You lunatic!

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.945 line:85.83%,end
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

00:37:20.279 --> 00:37:23.699 line:85.83%,end
If this is how you're playing it,
I have no choice but to talk to your boss.

00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:35.711 line:85.83%,end
Talking to their boss or not,
just leave this to me.

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:37.838 line:85.83%,end
Just go see your son off.

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:42.885 line:85.83%,end
I mean, you need to go cry
while burying your son

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:45.471 line:85.83%,end
for us to get more sympathy votes.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.014 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:50.393 line:85.83%,end
Right!

00:37:50.476 --> 00:37:52.186 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:55.189 line:85.83%,end
-You bastard!
-What?

00:37:56.732 --> 00:38:00.486 line:85.83%,end
My son died and my daughter's being
held hostage because of this operation!

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.950 line:85.83%,end
If this ends up failing,
I'll kill you first!

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:11.622 line:85.83%,end
Stop thinking about the sympathy vote
and take care of that clamor first!

00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:15.167 line:85.83%,end
What if this hostage situation
ends up doing us harm?

00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:20.506 line:85.83%,end
We must win it by a landslide!

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.133 line:85.83%,end
Am I wrong?

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:24.552 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.970 line:85.83%,end
Understand?

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:27.763 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:47.783 line:85.83%,end
<i>Hye-ryeong! Your mom's here!</i>

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.995 line:85.83%,end
<i>Let me go see if she's okay!</i>

00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:53.289 line:85.83%,end
RESTRICTED

00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.792 line:85.83%,end
RESTRICTED, SECURITY CHECKPOINT

00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:03.174 line:85.83%,end
Why is this happening to us? Seol-hui!

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:05.009 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui!

00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:06.427 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui!

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.764 line:85.83%,end
-Seol-hui! Dad's here!
-If something happened to my daughter,

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.307 line:85.83%,end
what will you do?

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.768 line:85.83%,end
-This is crazy!
-What are you doing?

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.811 line:85.83%,end
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

00:39:15.895 --> 00:39:17.229 line:85.83%,end
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.025 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui!

00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:24.862 line:85.83%,end
I'm in front of Hosu University where
explosions and a gunfight took place.

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:28.991 line:85.83%,end
As you can see, the parents' cries
and rage are filling the place.

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:32.036 line:85.83%,end
The hostages' families are
desperate to know if they're safe,

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:36.165 line:14.17%,start
<i>the ANSP keeps
telling them to trust them and wait.</i>

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:40.753 line:85.83%,end
<i>There is a public uproar
against the government's lousy response</i>

00:39:40.836 --> 00:39:42.838 line:85.83%,end
<i>because it might cause more casualties.</i>

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:44.507 line:85.83%,end
Lousy?

00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:47.843 line:85.83%,end
How dare he?
Hey, who's that bastard's boss?

00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:49.345 line:85.83%,end
I'll go wring his neck.

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.722 line:85.83%,end
Leave that to me, sir.

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:54.100 line:85.83%,end
I think you should
calm the parents down first.

00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:55.601 line:85.83%,end
<i>…more prompt response</i>

00:39:55.684 --> 00:39:58.312 line:85.83%,end
<i>-is needed at the moment…</i>
-God, it's a pain in the neck.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:39:59.480 line:85.83%,end
Turn that off.

00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:12.243 line:85.83%,end
Hey, are you sure all 34 are safe?

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.206 line:85.83%,end
I can prove it if you want.

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:21.752 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll send in a camcorder,
so film every one of them.</i>

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:23.629 line:85.83%,end
Don't leave out Dr. Kang. Okay?

00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:25.423 line:85.83%,end
Have Han-na bring it.

00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:31.887 line:85.83%,end
Hello? Have whom? Hey!

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.394 line:85.83%,end
I can't even laugh it off anymore.
My goodness.

00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:42.857 line:85.83%,end
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.941 line:85.83%,end
Roll up your sleeve.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.490 line:85.83%,end
You're bleeding!
