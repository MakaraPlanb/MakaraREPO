00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.154 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim!

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.614 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.032 line:85.83%,end
Careful.

00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:20.619 line:85.83%,end
My eardrums ruptured.

00:51:20.702 --> 00:51:22.621 line:85.83%,end
But it's temporary!

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:24.623 line:85.83%,end
Temporary!

00:51:29.628 --> 00:51:30.587 line:85.83%,end
That's a relief!

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.131 line:85.83%,end
The partition

00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:36.635 line:85.83%,end
must've blocked the blast.

00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:40.597 line:85.83%,end
The hostages are
in the prayer room, right?

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.267 line:85.83%,end
I keep being a burden to you.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.062 line:85.83%,end
I'm so ashamed, Comrade.

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:50.565 line:85.83%,end
That's not true!

00:51:55.028 --> 00:51:58.365 line:85.83%,end
You must be hungry.
Is there anything you want to eat?

00:51:59.074 --> 00:52:01.493 line:85.83%,end
Oh, something I want to eat?

00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:14.089 line:85.83%,end
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

00:52:23.056 --> 00:52:26.560 line:85.83%,end
Wait just a moment. I'll get it for you!

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.895 line:85.83%,end
No. It's okay!

00:52:36.027 --> 00:52:37.279 line:85.83%,end
A camcorder?

00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:41.616 line:85.83%,end
They want to see
if all 34 of the hostages are safe.

00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:45.162 line:85.83%,end
So Nam Tae-il said
he'll send a camcorder in.

00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.081 line:85.83%,end
I'll make sure

00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:50.500 line:85.83%,end
your true identity doesn't get leaked.

00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:56.464 line:85.83%,end
Let them send it in.

00:52:57.465 --> 00:52:58.550 line:85.83%,end
But,

00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:01.595 line:85.83%,end
don't bring Han-na in.

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:09.477 line:85.83%,end
But it must be Jang Han-na.

00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:12.898 line:85.83%,end
I clearly warned you.

00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:13.899 line:85.83%,end
Iâ€¦

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.277 line:85.83%,end
am the leader,
and my men's lives depend on me.

00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:20.447 line:85.83%,end
Even if I end up being punished
for doubting the party,

00:53:21.406 --> 00:53:23.366 line:85.83%,end
I must find out the truth.

00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:40.425 line:85.83%,end
Must you?

00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:45.680 line:85.83%,end
Answer me!

00:55:04.926 --> 00:55:07.595 line:85.83%,end
<i>You bastard. Are you joking with me?</i>

00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:11.725 line:85.83%,end
Send Han-na in with a camcorder.
I'll film all 34 of them.

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:13.727 line:85.83%,end
Han-na?

00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:16.563 line:85.83%,end
She was caught with Reporter Gal.

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:19.399 line:85.83%,end
Wait, Han-na is not
at the scene right now.

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.318 line:85.83%,end
I'll send in another agent.

00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:25.196 line:85.83%,end
No. If you want to check their safety,
send in Han-na.

00:55:26.364 --> 00:55:29.659 line:85.83%,end
Listen to this guy.
Do you have a thing for her or something?

00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:32.329 line:85.83%,end
In 30 minutes, I'll be at the shrine.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:34.873 line:85.83%,end
In 30 minutes? That's not going to happen!

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:38.918 line:85.83%,end
Give me an hour.
In return, make sure to film Dr. Kang.

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.211 line:85.83%,end
<i>Got it?</i>

00:55:42.547 --> 00:55:45.550 line:85.83%,end
He hung up on me again. God, this bastard.
I hate this guy.

00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:00.440 line:85.83%,end
Han-na!

00:56:01.107 --> 00:56:01.941 line:85.83%,end
Han-na!

00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:05.487 line:85.83%,end
Han-na, wait!
