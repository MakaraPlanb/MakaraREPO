00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.403 line:85.83%,end
Comrade.

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.196 line:85.83%,end
Our bag we hid in the lounge disappeared.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.866 line:85.83%,end
Move Eung-cheol first. Hurry!

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:33.633 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:34.967 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.719 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:40.640 line:85.83%,end
Comrade. Where are the hostages?

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.350 line:85.83%,end
Did they escape?

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.060 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.686 line:85.83%,end
Everything's okay.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:50.941 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.528 line:85.83%,end
Hang in there!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:49.125 line:85.83%,end
Sector 2-3 reporting.
We see Lim Soo-ho moving by the windows.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.168 line:85.83%,end
Sniping him is possible. Over.

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:53.796 line:85.83%,end
<i>Hold fire.
Hold fire unless ordered otherwise.</i>

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.632 line:85.83%,end
<i>Keep an eye on Lim Soo-ho
and keep me posted. Over.</i>

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.552 line:85.83%,end
Move the phone to room 207

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.471 line:85.83%,end
and set booby traps in front of
the cafeteria and between 204 and 211.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.641 line:85.83%,end
We must find our bag to set any bombs.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.810 line:85.83%,end
You know the guy who was after our money.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.614 line:85.83%,end
Why do they keep telling us
just to watch him?

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.158 line:85.83%,end
How would I know?

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.451 line:85.83%,end
Just do as told.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.962 line:85.83%,end
<i>They have no intention of breaking in
despite the explosion.</i>

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:21.550 line:85.83%,end
Send in every unit available
and suppress them right away.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:26.013 line:85.83%,end
<i>The bombs exploded in the cafeteria
where the hostages were kept</i>

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:28.891 line:85.83%,end
<i>and in room 203
where the ANSP agent was kept.</i>

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.685 line:85.83%,end
If anyone is injured,
we must get them out first.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:36.148 line:85.83%,end
The bomb exploded in the cafeteria
where the students were kept!

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.026 line:85.83%,end
There's no way
they would've killed the hostages.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.196 line:85.83%,end
Think about it. They obey
the orders even if they have to die.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:43.906 line:85.83%,end
<i>You think they'd kill them?</i>

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.700 line:85.83%,end
Someone must have touched
the booby traps by mistake.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.870 line:85.83%,end
Listen, you bastard.
My son's being buried today.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.414 line:85.83%,end
Are you going
to get my daughter killed too?

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.166 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.418 line:85.83%,end
The burial isn't important right now.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.170 line:85.83%,end
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.339 line:85.83%,end
You should go to the scene yourself. Now.

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:01.507 line:85.83%,end
Hurry.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.716 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:10.266 line:85.83%,end
FUNERAL OF STAFF SERGEANT EUN YEONG-U

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.061 line:85.83%,end
Only 13 must die.

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:15.729 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 13.

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.941 line:85.83%,end
No more, no less. Exactly 13.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:21.485 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 13. Please.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.655 line:85.83%,end
Sir. Please.

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:26.031 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.742 line:85.83%,end
I'm telling the truth.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.745 line:85.83%,end
I'd open up my heart
and show you if I could.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.082 line:85.83%,end
I did find the money bag.

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.376 line:85.83%,end
But I don't know where it is now.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.128 line:85.83%,end
Gye Bun-ok!

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.006 line:85.83%,end
That wench hid it away!

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.716 line:85.83%,end
That damn wench!

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:46.802 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok, please!

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.888 line:85.83%,end
Just tell them.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.307 line:85.83%,end
You don't want to die, do you?

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.976 line:85.83%,end
The habit of stealing from the students

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.270 line:85.83%,end
must've made you steal their money too!

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.981 line:85.83%,end
Did you see it?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:00.858 line:85.83%,end
I didn't do it.

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.068 line:85.83%,end
You didn't?

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.119 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.
