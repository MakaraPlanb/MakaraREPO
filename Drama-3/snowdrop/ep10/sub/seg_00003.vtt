00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.245 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.962 line:85.83%,end
-Sang-beom!
-I'll ask you one last time.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.674 line:85.83%,end
Answer on the count of three.

00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:30.262 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.680 line:85.83%,end
Or he dies.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.604 line:85.83%,end
-One.
-Bun-ok, please!

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:42.483 line:85.83%,end
You fool. Will you come clean
after someone dies because of you?

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:46.070 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok… Please, Bun-ok.

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.031 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok…

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.369 line:85.83%,end
Two.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.037 line:85.83%,end
No. Please!

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.540 line:85.83%,end
Please…

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.462 line:85.83%,end
It's in the restroom!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.425 line:85.83%,end
Where the cleaning supplies are.

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:18.435 line:85.83%,end
I saw it.

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.023 line:85.83%,end
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.486 line:85.83%,end
He was hiding the bag

00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:30.197 line:85.83%,end
in the restroom, and I saw it.

00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:38.288 line:85.83%,end
You b****.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.165 line:85.83%,end
I'll rip your mouth--

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:46.505 line:85.83%,end
You saw him threatening and telling me
not to tell anyone, right?

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:47.756 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.013 line:85.83%,end
Set the booby traps first. Hurry up.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.476 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol's hurt.

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.937 line:85.83%,end
I laid him down in room 212.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.162 line:85.83%,end
I told you…

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.292 line:85.83%,end
I clearly told you
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:30.674 line:85.83%,end
Now you will

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.968 line:85.83%,end
never be released.

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:36.805 line:85.83%,end
Dead or alive,

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.227 line:85.83%,end
we're in the same boat now.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.789 line:85.83%,end
<i>No casualties have yet to be confirmed.</i>

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:04.875 line:85.83%,end
<i>People are deeply concerned
that the late initial response might</i>

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.627 line:85.83%,end
<i>lead to injured hostages, if any,</i>

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.837 line:85.83%,end
<i>-missing the golden hour…</i>
-My goodness.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.173 line:85.83%,end
What if the hostages all died?

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.842 line:85.83%,end
Bombs exploded. I don't think

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:16.303 line:85.83%,end
only 13 people died.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:18.347 line:85.83%,end
But exactly 13 girls might have died

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.058 line:85.83%,end
just like the fortuneteller said.

00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:23.060 line:85.83%,end
Come on, ma'am.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.314 line:85.83%,end
When did the fortuneteller say
13 girls would die?

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.900 line:85.83%,end
He said 13 should die.

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:32.027 line:85.83%,end
You think I don't know that?

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.487 line:85.83%,end
I'm so worried

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:37.449 line:85.83%,end
because I have a feeling
that exactly 13 girls died.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.700 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 13.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.160 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.748 line:85.83%,end
<i>Chief An just came out.
Let's hear from him!</i>

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.212 line:85.83%,end
<i>We can't rule out additional explosions.</i>

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:51.922 line:85.83%,end
<i>So we're approaching very carefully…</i>

00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.632 line:85.83%,end
Is that your husband?

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.595 line:85.83%,end
Your husband must be a natural on TV.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:03.142 line:85.83%,end
I mean, he had so little presence,

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.561 line:85.83%,end
he was practically invisible.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.938 line:85.83%,end
But when he's in front of the cameras,

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.982 line:85.83%,end
he becomes a different person.

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:11.859 line:85.83%,end
My husband

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:13.735 line:85.83%,end
mentioned that too.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.284 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An's really popular these days.

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:23.620 line:85.83%,end
Even his fashion style is popular now.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:27.749 line:85.83%,end
Thanks to that, Ms. Choi has been
getting a lot of interview requests.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.794 line:85.83%,end
I'm not surprised.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.796 line:85.83%,end
Charlotte styles him after all.

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:40.554 line:85.83%,end
I heard the sunglasses he wears sell well
even though it's winter. Right?

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.349 line:85.83%,end
Those sunglasses?

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.519 line:85.83%,end
The hostages' lives are put…

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:48.854 line:85.83%,end
They're popular?

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:50.772 line:85.83%,end
Try them on.

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:57.779 line:85.83%,end
<i>Rescuing the hostages safely is</i>

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.364 line:85.83%,end
<i>our top priority.</i>

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:03.035 line:85.83%,end
<i>The President has already
instructed us to do everything</i>

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.370 line:85.83%,end
<i>in our power</i>

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:09.208 line:85.83%,end
<i>to rescue all of them safely…</i>

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.336 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure I've seen that bastard somewhere.
