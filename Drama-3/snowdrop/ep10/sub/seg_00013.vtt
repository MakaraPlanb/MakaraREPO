Just ten minutes ago,
they said she passed the main gate.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:49.171 line:85.83%,end
-Ten minutes ago?
-Yes, sir.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.674 line:85.83%,end
Ten minutes? You bastard!

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:53.884 line:85.83%,end
You let your subordinate
walk all over you,

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.845 line:85.83%,end
but you want to stand out
in front of cameras?

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.722 line:85.83%,end
-Huh? Is that it?
-Mr. An.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:06:59.849 line:85.83%,end
This is the Rhine.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.561 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Pi.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.274 line:85.83%,end
<i>Pi!</i>

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:13.738 line:85.83%,end
She cut me off.

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:15.156 line:85.83%,end
She cut me off!

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:17.366 line:85.83%,end
How dare she!

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.869 line:85.83%,end
You bastard! Go bring Han-na now!

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:21.370 line:85.83%,end
Bring Han-na!

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.039 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.498 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.793 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:42.558 line:85.83%,end
This belongs to Pi?

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.501 line:85.83%,end
<i>Was it</i>

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:11.754 line:85.83%,end
because of Yeong-ro?

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.633 line:85.83%,end
Since she's the director's daughter,

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:18.385 line:85.83%,end
they made you
a tapping room for security reasons?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:21.222 line:85.83%,end
In case he joined a protest,

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.183 line:85.83%,end
they asked you to watch her?

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:28.604 line:85.83%,end
Did my agency threaten you
to make you do that,

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:30.689 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi?

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:35.945 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.573 line:85.83%,end
-Was it really because of me?
-Of course not.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.203 line:85.83%,end
Don't try so hard to understand.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.164 line:85.83%,end
An inflexible stickler for the rules

01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:50.084 line:85.83%,end
turned out to be spying for the ANSP.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:51.836 line:85.83%,end
That's the truth.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:54.755 line:85.83%,end
But…

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:59.093 line:85.83%,end
Jeong-min's been protesting,
but you let her be.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.400 line:85.83%,end
Repeat after me.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.570 line:85.83%,end
Spies come in chaos,

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.738 line:85.83%,end
and prosperity comes in peace.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:23.868 line:85.83%,end
You tenacious wench.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:25.870 line:85.83%,end
How many more times do I have to tell you?

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.497 line:85.83%,end
If we… No, if I say

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.001 line:85.83%,end
you're a spy, then you are a spy.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.378 line:85.83%,end
A trial? That's just a formality.

01:09:36.922 --> 01:09:39.592 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? Look down properly!

01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:44.513 line:85.83%,end
If you don't change your mind,

01:09:44.597 --> 01:09:46.974 line:85.83%,end
you'll get swept away down there

01:09:47.474 --> 01:09:49.351 line:85.83%,end
without a trace.

01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:56.066 line:85.83%,end
It's so cold, isn't it?
Let's make it quick.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.862 line:85.83%,end
All right. You've been

01:10:00.487 --> 01:10:01.906 line:85.83%,end
to Pyongyang.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.201 line:85.83%,end
With your boyfriend. Right?

01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:13.375 line:85.83%,end
As I make someone a spy,

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.504 line:85.83%,end
I feel like I'm lovesick.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.845 line:85.83%,end
I've been only watching you
for the last few months.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.933 line:85.83%,end
I've been working so hard
to make you a spy!

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.478 line:85.83%,end
You're a spy, right?

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:42.071 line:85.83%,end
You're the one, aren't you?

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:44.281 line:85.83%,end
You're the one who went to Pyongyang

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.617 line:85.83%,end
with your lover! Who else would it be?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.411 line:85.83%,end
Tell me!

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:54.208 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.795 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you everything! I swear!

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.762 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.889 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you everything!

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:10.224 line:85.83%,end
I swear!

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.649 line:85.83%,end
I get the feeling

01:11:19.483 --> 01:11:22.319 line:85.83%,end
that you have
an ill-fated relationship with the ANSP.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:26.156 line:85.83%,end
A relationship? Being pestered
by evil men isn't a relationship.

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:33.330 line:85.83%,end
After framing two innocent people
for espionage and getting them killed,

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.458 line:85.83%,end
you people were awarded medals
and prize money!

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.129 line:85.83%,end
For serving the country loyally!
You think I'll ever forget it?
