EPISODE 10

3
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,362
Everyone stop.

4
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:20,864
Comrade Kang.

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,040
Don't move.

6
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,502
If anyone moves…

7
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,469
What is this?

8
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:46,098
You want us all to die together?

9
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,688
Damn it.

10
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:54,731
What the hell.

11
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,951
<i>A situation occurred. Sector 2 reporting.</i>

12
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,911
An explosion at Area 2-5.

13
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:11,039
Sector 3 reporting.
An explosion at Area 2-3 too.

14
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:12,082
Damn it!

15
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:13,333
How are the hostages?

16
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,418
Snipers, report.

17
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:16,628
Suppression team, stand by.

18
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,463
-Suppression team, stand by!
-Are you insane?

19
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:21,299
All units stand by
until we find out what's going on!

20
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,156
Drop the gun.

21
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:53,331
Drop the gun.

22
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,102
Everyone, hands over your heads.

23
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:17,272
Hands over your heads!

24
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,486
What, the whole dorm would explode?

25
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,323
I was a fool to believe you.

26
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,329
Everyone get up.

27
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:16,206
Get up!

28
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,304
Now.

29
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,307
Go to the lobby.

30
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,476
Go to the lobby!

31
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,267
Sit.

32
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:38,121
It was you, wasn't it?
Where did you hide the money bag?

33
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,706
Is that important right now?

34
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,666
Can't you see they failed to escape?

35
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,001
You little…

36
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,961
I don't know where it is either.

37
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,047
I know you hid it.

38
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,049
Do you have a death wish?

39
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:51,051
Why don't we go get the bag now?

40
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:53,553
Keep your heads down.

41
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,141
Damn it!

42
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,231
I'll go check the second floor.

43
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,368
You little bastard.

44
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,757
Follow me.

45
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,303
Isn't that Sang-beom?

46
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,848
Sang-beom, what's going on?

47
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,184
Are you okay?

48
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,814
What did you do this time?

49
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:48,233
Where's Eung-cheol?

50
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,198
Once everything's settled,
block the secret passage first.

51
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,116
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:05:59,035 --> 00:05:59,953
You fool.

53
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,759
We released 30 hostages,
yet you tried to escape?

54
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,971
Who put you up to it?

55
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:21,182
The ANSP?

56
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:25,019
Or the hall director?

57
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,315
Yes.

58
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:33,361
It was me.

59
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,197
The students just did as I said.

60
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,450
Is that so? You.

61
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,578
Were you hiding as she told you?

62
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:51,796
No.

63
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,009
That's not true.
I suggested escaping first.

64
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,594
Be quiet, Yeong-ro.

65
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,596
My brother's being buried today.

66
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:01,347
I wanted to go there.

67
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,016
I really wanted to be there,

68
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,726
so I asked her.

69
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,896
It was you again.

70
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:10,356
Because of you…

71
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:14,777
<i>my cover's been blown.</i>

72
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,532
Are you really a Northern spy?

73
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,453
Trying to help us and caring for us…

74
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,663
Were you putting on an act?

75
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,675
Eung-cheol!

76
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,344
Eung-cheol.

77
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:28,935
Eung-cheol!

78
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,397
Hey!

79
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,067
Eung-cheol!

80
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,402
Wake up, Eung-cheol!

81
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:40,154
Eung-cheol!

82
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,584
Eung-cheol! Wake up!

83
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,086
Comrade!

84
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,756
I can't hear you! Please speak louder!

85
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,803
Eung-cheol. Can you get up?

86
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,222
Hold me!

87
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,934
Let's go.

88
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,403
Comrade.

89
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,196
Our bag we hid in the lounge disappeared.

90
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:24,866
Move Eung-cheol first. Hurry!

91
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:41,633
Eung-cheol.

92
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:42,967
Eung-cheol!

93
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:44,719
Eung-cheol.

94
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:48,640
Comrade. Where are the hostages?

95
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,350
Did they escape?

96
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:52,060
No.

97
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:53,686
Everything's okay.

98
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:58,941
Don't worry.

99
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,528
Hang in there!

100
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:57,125
Sector 2-3 reporting.
We see Lim Soo-ho moving by the windows.

101
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,168
Sniping him is possible. Over.

102
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,796
<i>Hold fire.
Hold fire unless ordered otherwise.</i>

103
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,632
<i>Keep an eye on Lim Soo-ho
and keep me posted. Over.</i>

104
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:07,552
Move the phone to room 207

105
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:10,471
and set booby traps in front of
the cafeteria and between 204 and 211.

106
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,641
We must find our bag to set any bombs.

107
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:15,810
You know the guy who was after our money.

108
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,614
Why do they keep telling us
just to watch him?

109
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,158
How would I know?

110
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,451
Just do as told.

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,962
<i>They have no intention of breaking in
despite the explosion.</i>

112
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:29,550
Send in every unit available
and suppress them right away.

113
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:34,013
<i>The bombs exploded in the cafeteria
where the hostages were kept</i>

114
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,891
<i>and in room 203
where the ANSP agent was kept.</i>

115
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:39,685
If anyone is injured,
we must get them out first.

116
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:44,148
The bomb exploded in the cafeteria
where the students were kept!

117
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:47,026
There's no way
they would've killed the hostages.

118
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:50,196
Think about it. They obey
the orders even if they have to die.

119
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,906
<i>You think they'd kill them?</i>

120
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,700
Someone must have touched
the booby traps by mistake.

121
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:57,870
Listen, you bastard.
My son's being buried today.

122
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,414
Are you going
to get my daughter killed too?

123
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,166
Honey.

124
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,418
The burial isn't important right now.

125
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,170
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

126
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,339
You should go to the scene yourself. Now.

127
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:09,507
Hurry.

128
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,716
Hello?

129
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:18,266
FUNERAL OF STAFF SERGEANT EUN YEONG-U

130
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,061
Only 13 must die.

131
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,729
Exactly 13.

132
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:26,941
No more, no less. Exactly 13.

133
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,485
Exactly 13. Please.

134
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,655
Sir. Please.

135
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:34,031
Sang-beom.

136
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,742
I'm telling the truth.

137
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:39,745
I'd open up my heart
and show you if I could.

138
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,082
I did find the money bag.

139
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,376
But I don't know where it is now.

140
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,128
Gye Bun-ok!

141
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,006
That wench hid it away!

142
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,716
That damn wench!

143
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,802
Bun-ok, please!

144
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,888
Just tell them.

145
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,307
You don't want to die, do you?

146
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,976
The habit of stealing from the students

147
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,270
must've made you steal their money too!

148
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,981
Did you see it?

149
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,858
I didn't do it.

150
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,068
You didn't?

151
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:20,119
Bun-ok.

152
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,245
Please.

153
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,962
-Sang-beom!
-I'll ask you one last time.

154
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,674
Answer on the count of three.

155
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,262
Please.

156
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,680
Or he dies.

157
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,604
-One.
-Bun-ok, please!

158
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,483
You fool. Will you come clean
after someone dies because of you?

159
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:54,070
Bun-ok… Please, Bun-ok.

160
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,031
Bun-ok…

161
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:01,369
Two.

162
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,037
No. Please!

163
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,540
Please…

164
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,462
It's in the restroom!

165
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,425
Where the cleaning supplies are.

166
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,435
I saw it.

167
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,023
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

168
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:35,486
He was hiding the bag

169
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:38,197
in the restroom, and I saw it.

170
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,288
You b****.

171
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,165
I'll rip your mouth--

172
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:54,505
You saw him threatening and telling me
not to tell anyone, right?

173
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,756
Comrade Joo!

174
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,013
Set the booby traps first. Hurry up.

175
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:07,476
Eung-cheol's hurt.

176
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,937
I laid him down in room 212.

177
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,162
I told you…

178
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:31,292
I clearly told you
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

179
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,674
Now you will

180
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,968
never be released.

181
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,805
Dead or alive,

182
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,227
we're in the same boat now.

183
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:09,789
<i>No casualties have yet to be confirmed.</i>

184
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:12,875
<i>People are deeply concerned
that the late initial response might</i>

185
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,627
<i>lead to injured hostages, if any,</i>

186
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,837
<i>-missing the golden hour…</i>
-My goodness.

187
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,173
What if the hostages all died?

188
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,842
Bombs exploded. I don't think

189
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:24,303
only 13 people died.

190
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,347
But exactly 13 girls might have died

191
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,058
just like the fortuneteller said.

192
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,060
Come on, ma'am.

193
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,314
When did the fortuneteller say
13 girls would die?

194
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:37,900
He said 13 should die.

195
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,027
You think I don't know that?

196
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,487
I'm so worried

197
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:45,449
because I have a feeling
that exactly 13 girls died.

198
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,700
Exactly 13.

199
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:48,160
Darn it.

200
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,748
<i>Chief An just came out.
Let's hear from him!</i>

201
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:58,212
<i>We can't rule out additional explosions.</i>

202
00:17:58,504 --> 00:17:59,922
<i>So we're approaching very carefully…</i>

203
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,632
Is that your husband?

204
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:06,595
Your husband must be a natural on TV.

205
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,142
I mean, he had so little presence,

206
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,561
he was practically invisible.

207
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,938
But when he's in front of the cameras,

208
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,982
he becomes a different person.

209
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,859
My husband

210
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:21,735
mentioned that too.

211
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,284
Mr. An's really popular these days.

212
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,620
Even his fashion style is popular now.

213
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:35,749
Thanks to that, Ms. Choi has been
getting a lot of interview requests.

214
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,794
I'm not surprised.

215
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,796
Charlotte styles him after all.

216
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:48,554
I heard the sunglasses he wears sell well
even though it's winter. Right?

217
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,349
Those sunglasses?

218
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,519
The hostages' lives are put…

219
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,854
They're popular?

220
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:58,772
Try them on.

221
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:05,779
<i>Rescuing the hostages safely is</i>

222
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:07,364
<i>our top priority.</i>

223
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:11,035
<i>The President has already
instructed us to do everything</i>

224
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,370
<i>in our power</i>

225
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:17,208
<i>to rescue all of them safely…</i>

226
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,336
I'm sure I've seen that bastard somewhere.

227
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:26,467
In any case,

228
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:30,763
I owe you big time.

229
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,473
Don't mention it.

230
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:34,558
The ANSP exists

231
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:36,852
to protect sovereignty.

232
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:39,647
Sure.

233
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:44,944
Then it's also your job to protect me
to make my dad feel at ease, right?

234
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,656
You are right, sir.

235
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:54,245
That's the single
most important job for me,

236
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,080
An Gyeong-hui.

237
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:58,207
Right.

238
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,461
It's him!

239
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,257
He was quite clumsy back then.

240
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,509
Hey, give me the phone.

241
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:16,976
<i>You bastard. Are you an idiot?</i>

242
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,852
Did you forget about the plan?

243
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,273
I told you it must look like
you guys are making this drag on!

244
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:25,734
But what do you do?
You go ahead and blow up bombs?

245
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,736
Maybe I should've let them go.

246
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:31,865
The ANSP team leader was
about to escape with all of the hostages.

247
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,160
God, Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

248
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:36,245
-Salute!
-Salute!

249
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:41,000
You're meddling here again?

250
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,460
-Again? Huh?
-Get the suppression team ready.

251
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:45,212
All units stand by!

252
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:51,302
Lee Gang-mu, one of your men, was
about to escape with all of the hostages,

253
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,804
so they had no choice
but to blow up the bombs.

254
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,640
This is Eun Chang-su.

255
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,977
Once the suppression team goes in,
you'll all die in five minutes.

256
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:04,189
So tell me the truth.
Is Yeong-ro safe? And any casualties?

257
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,068
Calm down. I know this is a scheme.

258
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,948
All of the hostages
including your daughter are all safe.

259
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:17,202
Listen carefully. Seeing how
you unexpectedly blew up some bombs,

260
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,413
I can't let my daughter stay there.
Release her now.

261
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:21,707
What?

262
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:23,709
Are you insane?

263
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,879
Are you going to show
rescuing your daughter only

264
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,881
when all of the press cameras are here?

265
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,799
You were against it earlier!

266
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:35,054
Our agreement doesn't say
my daughter must be held hostage!

267
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,604
What about you?
You said we'd just rescue my daughter

268
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,190
if things got dangerous.
Why are you so worked up?

269
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,026
But we need some kind of insurance.

270
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:53,364
In case the word gets out.

271
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:59,620
If they find out your daughter is
also being held hostage,

272
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,164
who'll suspect it might be a scheme?

273
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,249
You son of a--

274
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:17,930
I, the ANSP director,
guarantee your safe return.

275
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:20,307
So release my daughter right now.

276
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:25,479
To return safely,
we need your daughter here.

277
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:27,773
Release her right this instant!

278
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,984
Be patient. I will in eight days.

279
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:33,529
You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?

280
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,449
I can prove that your daughter is safe.

281
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,911
All right. In exactly five minutes,

282
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,122
bring her to the cafeteria.

283
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,751
She'll stand by the windows in the lounge.

284
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:52,673
The press is watching us. They'll
see me only checking my daughter's safety.

285
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,675
Bring her to the cafeteria!

286
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,510
Or I'll send in the suppression team!

287
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,057
Get the snipers ready. Tell them to
kill him as soon as he brings my daughter!

288
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:03,892
Sniper team, this is Captain.

289
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,186
What are you doing?
Are you going to break in?

290
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,857
They even blew up bombs. We should act.
If we hesitate,

291
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,986
people will find it suspicious.
They might find out it's a scheme!

292
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,363
That's just what you think.

293
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,867
I already told our boss
this will drag on until the election.

294
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,826
Order them!

295
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:25,664
Kill Taedong River 1
as soon as he brings the hostage.

296
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,753
<i>Without my permission?</i>

297
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:36,425
You'll show Yeong-ro to them
without my permission?

298
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:41,513
Because of the explosion,
Eun's taking an offensive approach.

299
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:42,890
We should calm him down--

300
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,934
The bombs exploded
because Gang-mu tried to escape!

301
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,478
And even my cover--

302
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:57,112
Eun should be begging us for forgiveness,
so why do what he demands?

303
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,365
Comrade Kang.

304
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:03,577
We may be in the South

305
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,579
and occupying this place,

306
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,416
but we're in a third zone where
we must respect both countries' agreement.

307
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,587
In here, the ANSP director
isn't the leader of our enemies.

308
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:19,510
He's a friend who will send us back safely
by fooling the people in the South.

309
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,430
We can't trust him completely, of course.

310
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:24,473
So

311
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,476
we can't release Yeong-ro.

312
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,395
That's why we need to let him see
that his daughter is safe.

313
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:37,236
Are you sure
you can handle the consequences?

314
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:43,242
Yeong-ro's such a daring girl.
You think she won't try something?

315
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:49,414
The election is in eight days.

316
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:53,293
Calming Eun Chang-su and buying time
takes priority for now.

317
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:02,010
All right. Do as you wish, then.

318
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,315
<i>How dare you lock me in the basement?</i>

319
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,319
You want to die?

320
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:22,948
Do you want to die?

321
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,509
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, sir!

322
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,557
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:52,936
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

324
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:59,776
He told me to do it,
so I had no other choice.

325
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:04,531
In the South,
you must do as the ANSP says,

326
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:05,991
or you die.

327
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,826
Please don't kill us.

328
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,329
We had no idea.

329
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,250
You know why I'm beating you.

330
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,962
How dare you lock me in there?

331
00:26:27,262 --> 00:26:28,096
Let go.

332
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:29,973
Let go!

333
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,684
Stop it!

334
00:26:58,877 --> 00:26:59,878
Stop?

335
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,139
So someone got your back?

336
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,519
You think I'll go easy on you
like comrade Lim?

337
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:20,315
Eun Yeong-ro.

338
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:23,068
Follow me.

339
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,867
Get on my nerves again, and I'll kill you.

340
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,870
Eun Yeong-ro.

341
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,312
If Yeong-ro tries to tell them who I am,
you can shoot her.

342
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,189
But don't kill her.

343
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,863
Your father wants to see if you're safe.

344
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,533
My dad?

345
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:17,581
Let me talk to him over the phone.

346
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,587
Let me talk to him.

347
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,789
Do as I say.

348
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,416
If you say anything stupid,

349
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,586
you'll die.

350
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,147
-Give me the field glasses.
-Here, sir.

351
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:05,957
Yeong-ro.

352
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,588
Yeong-ro!

353
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:15,675
Dad.

354
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:25,810
That's enough.

355
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:27,729
Dad…

356
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:30,190
Dad!

357
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:31,232
Yeong-ro!

358
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:32,859
Yeong-ro!

359
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,863
I'm okay!

360
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:38,823
Okay, Yeong-ro!

361
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,451
My brother…

362
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:48,375
Send Yeong-u off well!

363
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:51,169
Yeong-ro!

364
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:53,546
Come here now.

365
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,726
Do you want to die?

366
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:10,605
Come here now.

367
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:19,781
Save us!

368
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:21,825
I can't trust anyone!

369
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:27,539
Hold fire!

370
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,926
Hey! Hold fire!

371
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:41,052
Hold fire!

372
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:42,387
Stop shooting!

373
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:54,774
Don't shoot!

374
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:56,735
Yeong-ro!

375
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:31,728
She said she couldn't trust anyone

376
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,730
and was about to say who you were.

377
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,150
We're okay.

378
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:46,659
I told you to do as I said!

379
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:14,854
Comrade Lim, move aside.

380
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:01,693
Comrade Joo.

381
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,070
Lock this brat in the basement.

382
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,364
Don't even give her water.

383
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:34,350
Go calm Eun Chang-su down first.

384
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,520
Okay.

385
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,410
<i>The spies fired first, so we fired back.
No casualties confirmed.</i>

386
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,456
Why did he even go there? That soft idiot.

387
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,292
You couldn't kill anyone, right?

388
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,629
Anyway, it was an attempt at suppression.
Let's leave it at that.

389
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:06,507
How dare you fire a gun? How dare you!

390
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:08,176
Release my daughter right now!

391
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,679
We can't release her
until our mission's over.

392
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:14,557
I'm warning you.

393
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,810
If you're planning to break in,

394
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:21,272
you should be prepared for her death.

395
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,899
You lunatic!

396
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,945
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

397
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:31,699
If this is how you're playing it,
I have no choice but to talk to your boss.

398
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:43,711
Talking to their boss or not,
just leave this to me.

399
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:45,838
Just go see your son off.

400
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:50,885
I mean, you need to go cry
while burying your son

401
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,471
for us to get more sympathy votes.

402
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,014
Right?

403
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:58,393
Right!

404
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:00,186
God damn it!

405
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,189
-You bastard!
-What?

406
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:08,486
My son died and my daughter's being
held hostage because of this operation!

407
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,950
If this ends up failing,
I'll kill you first!

408
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,622
Stop thinking about the sympathy vote
and take care of that clamor first!

409
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:23,167
What if this hostage situation
ends up doing us harm?

410
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:28,506
We must win it by a landslide!

411
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,133
Am I wrong?

412
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:32,552
You're right.

413
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:33,970
Understand?

414
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:35,763
Yes.

415
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:55,783
<i>Hye-ryeong! Your mom's here!</i>

416
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:58,995
<i>Let me go see if she's okay!</i>

417
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:01,289
RESTRICTED

418
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,792
RESTRICTED, SECURITY CHECKPOINT

419
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:11,174
Why is this happening to us? Seol-hui!

420
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,009
Seol-hui!

421
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,427
Seol-hui!

422
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,764
-Seol-hui! Dad's here!
-If something happened to my daughter,

423
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,307
what will you do?

424
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,768
-This is crazy!
-What are you doing?

425
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:23,811
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

426
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,229
-Hye-ryeong!
-Seol-hui!

427
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:29,025
Seol-hui!

428
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:32,862
I'm in front of Hosu University where
explosions and a gunfight took place.

429
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:36,991
As you can see, the parents' cries
and rage are filling the place.

430
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:40,036
The hostages' families are
desperate to know if they're safe,

431
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,165
<i>the ANSP keeps
telling them to trust them and wait.</i>

432
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:48,753
<i>There is a public uproar
against the government's lousy response</i>

433
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:50,838
<i>because it might cause more casualties.</i>

434
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:52,507
Lousy?

435
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:55,843
How dare he?
Hey, who's that bastard's boss?

436
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,345
I'll go wring his neck.

437
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:59,722
Leave that to me, sir.

438
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:02,100
I think you should
calm the parents down first.

439
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:03,601
<i>…more prompt response</i>

440
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,312
<i>-is needed at the moment…</i>
-God, it's a pain in the neck.

441
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:07,480
Turn that off.

442
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:20,243
Hey, are you sure all 34 are safe?

443
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,206
I can prove it if you want.

444
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:29,752
<i>I'll send in a camcorder,
so film every one of them.</i>

445
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:31,629
Don't leave out Dr. Kang. Okay?

446
00:39:31,712 --> 00:39:33,423
Have Han-na bring it.

447
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,887
Hello? Have whom? Hey!

448
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,394
I can't even laugh it off anymore.
My goodness.

449
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,857
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

450
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,941
Roll up your sleeve.

451
00:39:58,114 --> 00:39:59,490
You're bleeding!

452
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:20,511
You still don't take care of your body.

453
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,147
We need Han-na to come in here
as soon as possible.

454
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:34,859
He threatened me
saying they can kill us all

455
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:41,407
and that they have an astronomical amount
of money the North can never refuse.

456
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,242
That Nam Tae-il.

457
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,871
So?

458
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,833
Threatening to kill Gang-mu,

459
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:55,379
I had Han-na obtain proof
of their true intentions.

460
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:58,216
But the party guaranteed our safe return.

461
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,301
Do you doubt our party?

462
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:05,932
Stop using my loyalty to the party

463
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,977
to put down my reasonable doubt.

464
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:13,439
What?

465
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:19,737
I had to risk my life
trying to abduct Professor Han.

466
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:23,699
I never imagined it was
for the ruling party of the South

467
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,577
to regain power.

468
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:34,252
Comrade Park Geum-cheol took
his own life by taking cyanide.

469
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:38,631
And our agents died
during the engagement in the West Sea.

470
00:41:39,882 --> 00:41:41,509
I'm sure they never imagined

471
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,886
they died for the South administration

472
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:46,764
to regain power.

473
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:53,062
The party will secure
a huge amount of money.

474
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:56,357
With that money, Geum-cheol and the others

475
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:58,484
-will become heroes--
-If they do

476
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:02,113
become heroes of our republic,

477
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:06,659
I'm sure their families will live well.

478
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,165
But what parent can live happily

479
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:15,876
with money they got
for their children's deaths?

480
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:26,512
I must go back alive.

481
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:32,226
And Eung-cheol must go back alive
to live happily with his mother.

482
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,522
That's all the more reason
why I need to know…

483
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:41,152
what kind of deal
the North and the South made,

484
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,699
and if that huge amount of money
includes the price of our lives.

485
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:49,869
I must find out.

486
00:42:58,919 --> 00:42:59,962
Comrade.

487
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:06,636
Do you know who helped me get in here?

488
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:14,060
The President's favorite guy,
the ruling party's secretary-general,

489
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:15,144
Nam Tae-il.

490
00:43:18,022 --> 00:43:20,066
He's a future presidential candidate.

491
00:43:23,402 --> 00:43:25,613
To become his doctor…

492
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:27,448
No.

493
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:31,577
To have him wrapped around my finger,

494
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:36,374
it took me as many as 17 years.

495
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,465
And yet,

496
00:43:45,716 --> 00:43:48,010
the party ordered me to risk my life

497
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:51,722
to come in here and send you,
Taedong River 1, back to the North safely.

498
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:55,935
Now tell me.

499
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:58,562
Will the party abandon you guys?

500
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:07,947
I will not condone any more doubt.

501
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:14,286
Those who led the escape,
take them to the hall director's office.

502
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:16,330
Now.

503
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:43,399
You ANSP agent,
how did you find out about me?

504
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,485
You just came out of that room.

505
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:49,155
You still don't know?

506
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:52,742
Through wiretapping?

507
00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:55,661
A hall director of a women's dorm

508
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:59,707
put a bug on her students
and reported to the ANSP?

509
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:05,880
How did our lofty hall director
end up spying for the ANSP?

510
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:11,218
The doctor the ANSP sent in
turned out to be a Northern spy.

511
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:14,472
I can't hold a candle to you.

512
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:23,397
We were really going
to let you all go in eight days.

513
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:32,531
Now that my cover's blown,

514
00:45:33,032 --> 00:45:35,618
I wonder what instructions
the party will give me.

515
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,080
What kind of order regarding security,
Mr. ANSP Agent?

516
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:43,125
Don't tell me
you'll kill all the students.

517
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:47,379
If they want to keep everyone quiet,
they'll have to kill every single one.

518
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:52,301
But do you think
that'll keep your cover hidden forever?

519
00:45:53,093 --> 00:45:56,180
Your true identity
will be revealed someday like me.

520
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:57,348
And when that happens,

521
00:45:58,182 --> 00:46:00,267
you'll realize you've lived for nothing.

522
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:03,145
If you kill the innocent students,

523
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:05,981
how will you carry that guilt
for the rest of your life?

524
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,911
I wonder if you can keep being
hypocritical when faced with death.

525
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:20,079
Should I test it?

526
00:46:20,162 --> 00:46:21,080
Look.

527
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,375
I'm the one who planned the escape.
I coaxed them into it.

528
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,126
She didn't do anything wrong.

529
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,336
She tried to stop me.

530
00:46:27,419 --> 00:46:28,379
Shut up.

531
00:46:29,463 --> 00:46:31,257
If we must kill a hostage,
you're the first.

532
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:42,810
Lock them in the basement for now.

533
00:46:57,825 --> 00:46:58,909
Ms. Pi.

534
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,452
Are you okay?

535
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:01,912
Mr. Lee.

536
00:47:01,996 --> 00:47:03,163
Are you okay?

537
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:06,625
I'm okay.

538
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,806
The Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center

539
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:22,766
is an undercover spy?

540
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:27,313
And the ANSP sent her in here.
It means she even penetrated the agency.

541
00:47:28,147 --> 00:47:29,315
You think so too, right?

542
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:32,776
To keep her cover hidden,

543
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:36,614
she'll kill all the hostages.

544
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,035
You tried to escape knowing all that?

545
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:43,954
Should I have done nothing
trusting a frustrating enemy?

546
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:45,956
So what difference did it make?

547
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:04,058
Your stupidity has put
the hostages in more danger.

548
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:14,318
You want to save Yeong-ro too, right?

549
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:20,991
I want to save her too.

550
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:24,620
I know you don't want
the hostages to get killed. Neither do I.

551
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:33,087
She must be still loyal to the North
like any veteran spy would be.

552
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:36,423
But if she finds out they traded
their agents' lives for money,

553
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:38,384
I'm sure she'll change her mind.

554
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,803
Bring Han-na in.

555
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:43,097
She obtained the proof.

556
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,016
I know they locked her up,
but if you specifically ask for her,

557
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,267
they'll have to send her in.

558
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:50,354
Even if they took her recording,
she must've heard something.

559
00:48:50,437 --> 00:48:51,605
Right?

560
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:54,400
Bring her in
and listen to what she has to say.

561
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:56,735
You're the only one I can trust.

562
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:00,656
Please save the students' lives.
You know they're innocent,

563
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:02,741
don't you?

564
00:49:26,098 --> 00:49:26,974
Help us.

565
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:31,395
Please.

566
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:40,154
Lim Soo-ho!

567
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:22,154
Comrade Lim!

568
00:50:22,237 --> 00:50:23,614
Eung-cheol!

569
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,032
Careful.

570
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:28,619
My eardrums ruptured.

571
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:30,621
But it's temporary!

572
00:50:31,413 --> 00:50:32,623
Temporary!

573
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:38,587
That's a relief!

574
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,131
The partition

575
00:50:43,008 --> 00:50:44,635
must've blocked the blast.

576
00:50:46,136 --> 00:50:48,597
The hostages are
in the prayer room, right?

577
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:52,267
I keep being a burden to you.

578
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,062
I'm so ashamed, Comrade.

579
00:50:57,439 --> 00:50:58,565
That's not true!

580
00:51:03,028 --> 00:51:06,365
You must be hungry.
Is there anything you want to eat?

581
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:09,493
Oh, something I want to eat?

582
00:51:18,544 --> 00:51:22,089
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

583
00:51:31,056 --> 00:51:34,560
Wait just a moment. I'll get it for you!

584
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:36,895
No. It's okay!

585
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:45,279
A camcorder?

586
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:49,616
They want to see
if all 34 of the hostages are safe.

587
00:51:50,951 --> 00:51:53,162
So Nam Tae-il said
he'll send a camcorder in.

588
00:51:54,705 --> 00:51:56,081
I'll make sure

589
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:58,500
your true identity doesn't get leaked.

590
00:52:03,422 --> 00:52:04,464
Let them send it in.

591
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:06,550
But,

592
00:52:08,302 --> 00:52:09,595
don't bring Han-na in.

593
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:17,477
But it must be Jang Han-na.

594
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:20,898
I clearly warned you.

595
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:21,899
I…

596
00:52:22,983 --> 00:52:25,277
am the leader,
and my men's lives depend on me.

597
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:28,447
Even if I end up being punished
for doubting the party,

598
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:31,366
I must find out the truth.

599
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:48,425
Must you?

600
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:53,680
Answer me!

601
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:15,595
<i>You bastard. Are you joking with me?</i>

602
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,725
Send Han-na in with a camcorder.
I'll film all 34 of them.

603
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:21,727
Han-na?

604
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:24,563
She was caught with Reporter Gal.

605
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:27,399
Wait, Han-na is not
at the scene right now.

606
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:29,318
I'll send in another agent.

607
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:33,196
No. If you want to check their safety,
send in Han-na.

608
00:54:34,364 --> 00:54:37,659
Listen to this guy.
Do you have a thing for her or something?

609
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:40,329
In 30 minutes, I'll be at the shrine.

610
00:54:40,412 --> 00:54:42,873
In 30 minutes? That's not going to happen!

611
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:46,918
Give me an hour.
In return, make sure to film Dr. Kang.

612
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:48,211
<i>Got it?</i>

613
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:53,550
He hung up on me again. God, this bastard.
I hate this guy.

614
00:55:07,606 --> 00:55:08,440
Han-na!

615
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:09,941
Han-na!

616
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:13,487
Han-na, wait!

617
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:36,802
These are the students' dorm records
you asked for.

618
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:56,113
GYE BUN-OK

619
00:55:56,738 --> 00:55:59,074
HOSU UNIVERSITY TELEPHONE OPERATOR

620
00:55:59,157 --> 00:56:00,951
She's a telephone operator?

621
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:06,706
She's perfect for watching the hostages.

622
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,876
They're just 34 people.
I can watch them by myself. Why--

623
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,045
You need you to keep an eye on Soo-ho.

624
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:16,466
Leave it to me
if you need to get rid of Lim Soo-ho.

625
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:22,556
Don't get ahead of yourself.
That's not what I meant.

626
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,683
I was given a secret order.

627
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,936
To keep a close watch on him

628
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:31,189
and kill him without mercy
if I sense any change in his ideology.

629
00:56:31,815 --> 00:56:33,483
Kill him without mercy?

630
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:37,612
Not just observe each other's ideology?

631
00:56:37,696 --> 00:56:40,782
She said Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

632
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,702
Who said that?

633
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:47,622
The Ministry of State Security,

634
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,334
Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

635
00:56:57,257 --> 00:56:59,009
Deputy Director Choi did?

636
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:03,722
And he seems to know
I'm allowed to kill him.

637
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:08,268
Despite knowing that, he still
sticks up for Yeong-ro in front of me.

638
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:10,854
I understand.

639
00:57:13,148 --> 00:57:14,691
Go bring her to me for now.

640
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:26,161
Choi Su-ryeon…

641
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:31,249
She's not even in charge of Soo-ho. Why?

642
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:35,170
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

643
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:38,715
Moran Hill 1's cover has been blown.
Action needed for security.

644
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:45,096
If we want Moran Hill 1's cover
to stay hidden,

645
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,599
we must kill all of the hostages.

646
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,851
But the South won't let it slide.

647
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:53,772
The deal is to let the hostages live
in return for 300 million dollars.

648
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:00,070
Since when did we

649
00:58:00,612 --> 00:58:03,073
only do as agreed with the South?

650
00:58:03,657 --> 00:58:05,742
Besides, the South's goal is

651
00:58:05,825 --> 00:58:07,244
to win the election,

652
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:09,579
not to save the hostages' lives.

653
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:14,167
Because of your son,

654
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:17,128
I reported to the party that
you were not fit to make a wise decision.

655
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:19,548
What?

656
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,925
Until the presidential election is over,

657
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:23,885
I'm the director
of the United Front Department!

658
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,220
I make decisions--

659
00:58:25,303 --> 00:58:27,264
The socialism in Eastern Europe
is in crisis.

660
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:31,059
If this deal goes wrong, our party
will also face a crisis. You know that.

661
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,854
You'll remain as director
of the UFD until the election is over.

662
00:58:35,438 --> 00:58:37,399
But I'll make all operational decisions.

663
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:40,026
That's the party's decision.
Do you understand?

664
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,319
You…

665
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:46,366
Don't worry about your son.

666
00:58:46,992 --> 00:58:49,119
If he sacrifices his life for the country,

667
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,663
he'll be titled a Hero of the Republic.

668
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:53,748
And if that happens,

669
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:57,419
you'll be acquitted
of failing this mission.

670
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,171
Aren't you happy?

671
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:08,555
SERVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE!

672
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,480
I should be happy

673
00:59:18,023 --> 00:59:20,650
to be acquitted
thanks to my child's sacrifice?

674
00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:26,698
If one of our spies in the dorm
were your son,

675
00:59:30,535 --> 00:59:32,454
would you have made the same decision?

676
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:33,538
Of course.

677
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:37,208
As a revolutionary warrior
of our dignified independent country,

678
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:39,878
that's the most honorable death
anyone could ask for.

679
00:59:45,842 --> 00:59:47,594
Send Taedong River 1 a message.

680
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:52,682
To protect Moran Hill 1's identity,

681
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:55,560
the day before the presidential election,

682
00:59:56,478 --> 00:59:58,521
he is to kill all of the hostages.

683
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:01,900
Right away, Comrade Deputy Director.

684
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:52,909
Most people wouldn't

685
01:00:53,326 --> 01:00:55,954
even dare to touch Northern spies' money.

686
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,126
I guess you really needed money.

687
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:04,170
I'm…

688
01:01:04,254 --> 01:01:07,549
I'm so sorry. Please spare me.

689
01:01:11,553 --> 01:01:12,470
Do you want to live?

690
01:01:17,142 --> 01:01:18,893
Then from now on,

691
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:23,022
manage and keep an eye on the hostages.

692
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,067
Pardon?

693
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:28,945
You mean,

694
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:30,697
me?

695
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,158
What? Do you not want to?

696
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:52,802
I wasn't giving you a choice.

697
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:55,013
I was ordering you.

698
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:04,647
I had an older sister.

699
01:02:06,483 --> 01:02:10,153
She was smart enough for the country
to send her abroad to study.

700
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,074
So my parents treated me
like some good-for-nothing.

701
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:16,910
They only…

702
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:20,622
cared about my sister.

703
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:25,084
But when she was in Germany,
a Northern spy--

704
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:32,550
A North Korean persuaded her to join them.

705
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,930
Then while she was questioned
for espionage, she died.

706
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:41,643
My dad collapsed because of the shock

707
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:43,895
and has been in the hospital
for seven years.

708
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:46,856
So if I help you

709
01:02:47,857 --> 01:02:50,235
and end up getting arrested
for espionage too…

710
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:58,535
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

711
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,622
But the kids will know.

712
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,167
Well…

713
01:03:09,963 --> 01:03:11,464
As I said, don't worry.

714
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:22,600
To show that I appreciate
the value of your labor…

715
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:24,102
Comrade Joo.

716
01:03:24,936 --> 01:03:26,771
Give her ten years' salary all at once.

717
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:36,197
This will

718
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:38,825
keep you safe.

719
01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:18,197
No one outside the dorm will ever find out
that you've helped us. Don't worry.

720
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,869
She must be planning to kill all of them.

721
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:26,080
If

722
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:30,335
I don't accept this offer…

723
01:04:34,464 --> 01:04:35,882
I'm sure she'll kill me.

724
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:45,410
Hey, is Jang Han-na not here yet?

725
01:05:45,952 --> 01:05:48,204
What's taking her so long?
She left there ages ago!

726
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,415
Why isn't she here yet?
Do you want to die?

727
01:05:50,498 --> 01:05:52,458
-Do you? I'll kill you!
-No, sir.

728
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:55,503
Just ten minutes ago,
they said she passed the main gate.

729
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:57,171
-Ten minutes ago?
-Yes, sir.

730
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:59,674
Ten minutes? You bastard!

731
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:01,884
You let your subordinate
walk all over you,

732
01:06:01,968 --> 01:06:03,845
but you want to stand out
in front of cameras?

733
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:05,722
-Huh? Is that it?
-Mr. An.

734
01:06:06,347 --> 01:06:07,849
This is the Rhine.

735
01:06:10,435 --> 01:06:11,561
Hey, Pi.

736
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:16,274
<i>Pi!</i>

737
01:06:20,653 --> 01:06:21,738
She cut me off.

738
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:23,156
She cut me off!

739
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,366
How dare she!

740
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,869
You bastard! Go bring Han-na now!

741
01:06:27,952 --> 01:06:29,370
Bring Han-na!

742
01:06:30,038 --> 01:06:31,039
Damn it.

743
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:32,498
Hey!

744
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:35,793
God damn it!

745
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:50,558
This belongs to Pi?

746
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,501
<i>Was it</i>

747
01:07:17,543 --> 01:07:19,754
because of Yeong-ro?

748
01:07:21,923 --> 01:07:23,633
Since she's the director's daughter,

749
01:07:23,716 --> 01:07:26,385
they made you
a tapping room for security reasons?

750
01:07:27,136 --> 01:07:29,222
In case he joined a protest,

751
01:07:30,348 --> 01:07:32,183
they asked you to watch her?

752
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:36,604
Did my agency threaten you
to make you do that,

753
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:38,689
Ms. Pi?

754
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,945
Ms. Pi.

755
01:07:45,613 --> 01:07:47,573
-Was it really because of me?
-Of course not.

756
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:52,203
Don't try so hard to understand.

757
01:07:52,286 --> 01:07:55,164
An inflexible stickler for the rules

758
01:07:55,748 --> 01:07:58,084
turned out to be spying for the ANSP.

759
01:07:58,501 --> 01:07:59,836
That's the truth.

760
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:02,755
But…

761
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:07,093
Jeong-min's been protesting,
but you let her be.

762
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,400
Repeat after me.

763
01:08:23,526 --> 01:08:25,570
Spies come in chaos,

764
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:27,738
and prosperity comes in peace.

765
01:08:30,783 --> 01:08:31,868
You tenacious wench.

766
01:08:31,951 --> 01:08:33,870
How many more times do I have to tell you?

767
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,497
If we… No, if I say

768
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:40,001
you're a spy, then you are a spy.

769
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:42,378
A trial? That's just a formality.

770
01:08:44,922 --> 01:08:47,592
What are you doing? Look down properly!

771
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:52,513
If you don't change your mind,

772
01:08:52,597 --> 01:08:54,974
you'll get swept away down there

773
01:08:55,474 --> 01:08:57,351
without a trace.

774
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:04,066
It's so cold, isn't it?
Let's make it quick.

775
01:09:05,026 --> 01:09:07,862
All right. You've been

776
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:09,906
to Pyongyang.

777
01:09:10,865 --> 01:09:13,201
With your boyfriend. Right?

778
01:09:18,414 --> 01:09:21,375
As I make someone a spy,

779
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,504
I feel like I'm lovesick.

780
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,845
I've been only watching you
for the last few months.

781
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,933
I've been working so hard
to make you a spy!

782
01:09:39,185 --> 01:09:40,478
You're a spy, right?

783
01:09:47,693 --> 01:09:50,071
You're the one, aren't you?

784
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:52,281
You're the one who went to Pyongyang

785
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:54,617
with your lover! Who else would it be?

786
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,411
Tell me!

787
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:02,208
I'll tell you.

788
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:05,795
I'll tell you everything! I swear!

789
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:14,762
I'll tell you.

790
01:10:15,388 --> 01:10:16,889
I'll tell you everything!

791
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:18,224
I swear!

792
01:10:25,064 --> 01:10:26,649
I get the feeling

793
01:10:27,483 --> 01:10:30,319
that you have
an ill-fated relationship with the ANSP.

794
01:10:30,403 --> 01:10:34,156
A relationship? Being pestered
by evil men isn't a relationship.

795
01:10:37,326 --> 01:10:41,330
After framing two innocent people
for espionage and getting them killed,

796
01:10:41,414 --> 01:10:44,458
you people were awarded medals
and prize money!

797
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:48,129
For serving the country loyally!
You think I'll ever forget it?

798
01:10:52,675 --> 01:10:53,926
For serving…

799
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:09,025
The one who tortured me the most cruelly…

800
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:16,157
shed tears in front of the people
on the day I was released.

801
01:11:19,118 --> 01:11:21,620
With the look on his face just like yours.

802
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:14,548
Starting today, Bun-ok

803
01:12:15,299 --> 01:12:17,885
will manage and watch all of you.

804
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:20,596
-What? Why?
-She'll manage us?

805
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:21,889
What's going on?

806
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:22,890
Why Gizzard?

807
01:12:24,266 --> 01:12:25,226
Quiet.

808
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:29,438
You must obey Bun-ok's orders.
Don't talk back to her.

809
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:31,816
Whoever disobeys her

810
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:34,402
is disobeying me.

811
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:36,946
So I'll kill them without mercy.

812
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:51,252
That vicious wench.

813
01:13:03,389 --> 01:13:04,974
-What's going on?
-Tell me about it.

814
01:13:05,057 --> 01:13:05,933
Bun-ok.

815
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:07,726
-What does she think she is?
-Are you

816
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,521
on the spies' side now?

817
01:13:12,231 --> 01:13:13,232
On their side?

818
01:13:13,315 --> 01:13:14,817
Watch what you say.

819
01:13:15,526 --> 01:13:18,070
I'm just supervising you in Pi's place.

820
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:30,207
Supervising, whatever.

821
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:31,750
Who is she to supervise us?

822
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:33,919
What are we, kindergarteners?

823
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:43,971
You've now even become
a lackey for the Northern spies?

824
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:47,391
Listen. This is way worse than stealing.

825
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,602
Once we're all released,

826
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:52,104
I'm sure you'll go to jail
for helping the spies.

827
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:54,815
People will throw stones at your family.

828
01:14:01,947 --> 01:14:03,491
That crazy wench.

829
01:14:17,254 --> 01:14:18,339
Yes.

830
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:20,424
I'm a thieving wench.

831
01:14:23,469 --> 01:14:26,847
Countless rings that you got
from this guy and that guy.

832
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:31,143
Pairs of dress shoes
you bought but wouldn't wear.

833
01:14:31,227 --> 01:14:34,271
Designer clothes you wore once
on a blind date and forgot about.

834
01:14:37,024 --> 01:14:39,276
I'm a thief who didn't feel guilty

835
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:41,487
about stealing them.

836
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:47,451
What are you jabbering about?

837
01:14:48,202 --> 01:14:49,620
Boasting about stealing?

838
01:14:50,329 --> 01:14:52,414
When did you ever treat me like a human?

839
01:14:53,082 --> 01:14:55,167
You treated me like some machine

840
01:14:55,251 --> 01:14:59,630
that took calls for you without any
emotions or desires, and laughed at me.

841
01:15:00,923 --> 01:15:03,342
Like I wasn't human
since I wasn't a college student.

842
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:06,512
-When did we do that?
-We didn't.

843
01:15:06,595 --> 01:15:07,930
-No, we didn't.
-No way.

844
01:15:15,354 --> 01:15:16,939
I'll return the favor.

845
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:22,528
See how it feels like
to be bullied by Gizzard.

846
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,406
You should feel it.

847
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:29,076
That's only fair.

848
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:30,703
Don't you agree?

849
01:15:33,289 --> 01:15:34,373
Ko Hye-ja?

850
01:15:39,169 --> 01:15:41,046
Hands over your head with your face down.

851
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,552
Heads down, all of you!

852
01:16:05,529 --> 01:16:09,074
Film every single hostage
including the doctor.

853
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:10,743
An hour will be enough, right?

854
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:12,995
I'll radio you once I'm done.

855
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,539
What about the proof?

856
01:16:20,794 --> 01:16:23,172
I need to see my team leader first.

857
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:25,466
Your fiancé is safe, so don't worry.

858
01:16:26,925 --> 01:16:28,218
It'll only take a minute.

859
01:16:28,886 --> 01:16:31,555
I risked my life to get this.
You can't even allow me a minute?

860
01:16:35,309 --> 01:16:38,103
All right, fine. I'll just give it to you.

861
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,825
In order to obtain this, a person is

862
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:55,204
dying in the interrogation room
of the ANSP.

863
01:16:56,914 --> 01:16:57,998
So listen to it carefully.

864
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:00,918
I've brought this to you

865
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:03,337
because I think you're different

866
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,631
from Geum-cheol
who killed himself with cyanide.

867
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,351
Hey.

868
01:17:17,893 --> 01:17:22,398
Shouldn't you at least give water
to Yeong-ro and Ms. Pi?

869
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:25,818
How long will you keep us tied up?

870
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:35,661
Comrade Kang wants to see you.

871
01:17:36,286 --> 01:17:37,913
Tell her I'll radio the party first.

872
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:42,292
Lim Soo-ho.

873
01:17:42,376 --> 01:17:44,545
We're rats in a trap!

874
01:17:45,254 --> 01:17:46,630
Rats in a trap.

875
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:05,733
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

876
01:18:05,899 --> 01:18:10,070
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

877
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,865
<i>and saving the hostages. Right?</i>

878
01:18:16,785 --> 01:18:18,662
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

879
01:18:18,954 --> 01:18:23,167
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies.</i>

880
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:30,799
<i>Enemies are everywhere.</i>

881
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,595
Those who have power
all thanks to their family name

882
01:18:34,678 --> 01:18:36,805
have their guns pointed at me.

883
01:18:36,889 --> 01:18:41,393
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

884
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:42,895
Don't forget that.

885
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:48,734
If my father has been suspended…

886
01:18:50,235 --> 01:18:51,236
<i>Right.</i>

887
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,405
<i>That must be it.</i>

888
01:18:53,906 --> 01:18:56,366
<i>It must have been someone else's decision.</i>

889
01:18:57,826 --> 01:18:59,453
<i>There's no way my father would…</i>

890
01:19:45,207 --> 01:19:46,750
Ryesong River 1, can you hear me?

891
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:50,045
<i>Ryesong River 1, loud and clear.</i>

892
01:19:52,464 --> 01:19:54,383
Any change in the location
of Mount Myohyang?

893
01:20:19,283 --> 01:20:20,325
What were you doing?

894
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:23,996
I radioed the message about your cover

895
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:26,373
being blown and asked what to do about it.

896
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,750
But there was no reply,
so I was about to do it again.

897
01:20:32,087 --> 01:20:33,547
It's an important matter,

898
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,841
so it must be taking them
quite a while to discuss.

899
01:20:37,217 --> 01:20:38,093
Oh, right.

900
01:20:40,053 --> 01:20:42,806
Does the party know
the ANSP director's daughter is here?

901
01:20:44,975 --> 01:20:46,143
They do.

902
01:21:31,313 --> 01:21:32,648
This is Eun Chang-su.

903
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:35,776
You know my daughter's
being held hostage, right?

904
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:41,198
Could you order your agents
to release my daughter right away?

905
01:21:42,908 --> 01:21:44,910
Then meet our demand first.

906
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:48,038
Send us 300 million dollars in three days.

907
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,247
Pardon?

908
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:52,709
But you agreed to receive it
after the operation was over.

909
01:21:52,793 --> 01:21:55,087
If you don't send it to us in three days,

910
01:21:55,504 --> 01:21:57,297
all of the hostages will die.

911
01:21:57,381 --> 01:21:58,382
What?

912
01:21:59,216 --> 01:22:00,509
Are you kidding me?

913
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:03,136
Remember. You have three days.

914
01:22:07,432 --> 01:22:08,517
Hello?

915
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:09,601
Hello?

916
01:22:59,443 --> 01:23:02,237
KILL ALL HOSTAGES DAY BEFORE ELECTION

917
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,887
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

918
01:23:37,147 --> 01:23:38,607
God damn it!

919
01:24:09,888 --> 01:24:12,057
<i>No change in Mount Myohyang's location.</i>

920
01:24:13,183 --> 01:24:15,477
No change in Mount Myohyang's location.

921
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:19,356
<i>My father is still
the director of the UFD.</i>

922
01:24:22,651 --> 01:24:23,944
<i>Then he has…</i>

923
01:24:25,779 --> 01:24:27,114
<i>abandoned me?</i>

924
01:24:44,589 --> 01:24:46,633
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

925
01:24:46,716 --> 01:24:49,719
My sister's sick. Please help her!

926
01:24:53,932 --> 01:24:54,975
Come on.

927
01:24:55,058 --> 01:24:57,477
-We have no time for that.
-Yes, sir.

928
01:24:58,145 --> 01:25:01,481
My father died trying to save other people
when the mine collapsed.

929
01:25:01,565 --> 01:25:06,319
So in my father's place,
shouldn't the party save my sister?

930
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:13,952
What are you doing? Go away!

931
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:17,289
Please give me a ride to Pyongyang.

932
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:20,125
We even got kicked out
of the train because we had no pass!

933
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:24,880
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

934
01:25:24,963 --> 01:25:26,840
-Come here!
-Please help us!

935
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,092
Please! My sister's sick!

936
01:25:29,509 --> 01:25:31,052
Please help her!

937
01:25:35,182 --> 01:25:37,767
If you give us a ride,
I'll make sure to repay you.

938
01:25:38,894 --> 01:25:40,103
Repay me?

939
01:25:40,687 --> 01:25:41,521
How?

940
01:25:42,147 --> 01:25:44,107
I will do anything.

941
01:25:45,108 --> 01:25:47,277
If you tell me to die, I will!

942
01:26:25,106 --> 01:26:26,483
You're hungry, aren't you?

943
01:26:27,317 --> 01:26:30,528
This won't do. Demand some more food.

944
01:26:38,787 --> 01:26:39,955
Stand up.

945
01:26:51,675 --> 01:26:52,842
Put your hands up.

946
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:32,132
You son of a b****.

947
01:27:38,763 --> 01:27:40,557
<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

948
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,102
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

949
01:27:44,185 --> 01:27:46,688
<i>The more likely
the ruling party is to win the election,</i>

950
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:48,106
<i>the less likely we're to live.</i>

951
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:51,067
<i>I feel like I can hear
the approval rating going up.</i>

952
01:27:55,363 --> 01:27:56,406
How is it in there?

953
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:57,449
Actually,

954
01:27:58,074 --> 01:27:59,868
Lim Soo-ho the spy…

955
01:27:59,951 --> 01:28:01,870
Who ordered to kill me?

956
01:28:01,953 --> 01:28:04,622
<i>You were a card to discard to begin with.</i>

957
01:28:04,706 --> 01:28:06,082
Be careful.

958
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:08,043
<i>If you don't send
300 million in three days…</i>

959
01:28:09,002 --> 01:28:10,170
<i>Bun-ok…</i>

960
01:28:10,253 --> 01:28:12,213
<i>Your daughter will be killed first.</i>

961
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:15,467
<i>I must get out of here alive.</i>

962
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:18,762
<i>Yeong-ro.</i>

963
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,563
BONUS

964
01:28:28,813 --> 01:28:30,315
I'll check the food first.

965
01:28:30,398 --> 01:28:31,358
6 MONTHS AGO

966
01:28:31,983 --> 01:28:33,109
You may go in.

967
01:28:59,344 --> 01:29:03,348
My, my. You guys did
a variety of drugs here.

968
01:29:05,767 --> 01:29:06,643
Look who's here.

969
01:29:06,726 --> 01:29:09,813
Isn't this Ms. Lee Yu-rim,
the most popular singer?

970
01:29:09,896 --> 01:29:11,231
Nice to meet you!

971
01:29:11,606 --> 01:29:13,483
Miss, over there. Strike a pose!

972
01:29:14,025 --> 01:29:15,026
Good.

973
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:18,154
Our handsome Crown Prince,
strike a pose too!

974
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:19,614
Great.

975
01:29:19,697 --> 01:29:20,990
Hey, you two,

976
01:29:21,074 --> 01:29:22,492
you look great.

977
01:29:23,326 --> 01:29:24,828
Damn it!

978
01:29:25,412 --> 01:29:26,704
Pose!

979
01:29:26,788 --> 01:29:28,665
Great.

980
01:29:29,249 --> 01:29:31,960
Hey. Kick him out.

981
01:29:32,669 --> 01:29:33,628
Guard…

982
01:29:36,089 --> 01:29:37,382
Guard!

983
01:29:52,564 --> 01:29:53,857
This?

984
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:55,692
Are you insane?

985
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:28,558
Whether the President's son does meth
or his wife cheats,

986
01:30:29,142 --> 01:30:31,227
we'll take care of it, so stay out of it.

987
01:30:31,311 --> 01:30:33,104
Who are you? How did you know I was here?

988
01:30:41,237 --> 01:30:43,531
There are so many
other news stories to write.

989
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:46,409
So stop here.

990
01:30:49,829 --> 01:30:51,206
No… Don't do it!
