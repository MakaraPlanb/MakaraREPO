SPRING 1987

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,617
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,558
Could you put this in your bag?

5
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,980
Hey, check this out. Look.

6
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>-We keep missing each other
-We keep missing each other</i>

7
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,321
<i>-With time passing by
-With time passing by</i>

8
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:57,742
<i>For the long time
there’s a weathered grave wood</i>

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:02,705
<i>The rain and winds erased
the name on the wood</i>

10
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,881
Room 207.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,927
<i>Room 207.</i>

12
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,220
Get out of my way.

13
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,763
Eun Yeong-ro.

14
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,806
<i>There's a call for you.</i>

15
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,358
Me? A call for me?

16
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,534
-That hurt!
-I'm sorry.

17
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,370
Hey, move out of the way!

18
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,334
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

19
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,848
Get out of my way.

20
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,311
Five, four, three, two,

21
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,478
-Wait!
-one.

22
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,980
Wait. No!

23
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,485
You know you have to
take it in 30 seconds.

24
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,655
-I do.
-Should I make an exception?

25
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,492
Should I?

26
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:22,911
I shouldn't.

27
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,464
This is the Hosu Women's University dorm.

28
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,925
A student in room 205?

29
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,720
Yes. You're calling for Lee Yeon-suk?

30
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,388
Okay.

31
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
Hello?

32
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,577
Hey, who was it? It was him, wasn't it?

33
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,747
The engineering major
you met the other day, right?

34
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,041
I told you,
that long-haired guy and I are done.

35
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,168
He didn't even call me after that day.

36
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,713
Then who was it? It was
your first time getting a phone call.

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,802
It was my grandma
asking what time I'd be taking the bus.

38
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,220
I really thought it was him.

39
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,766
You know, phone calls are
usually for Hye-ryeong.

40
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,892
It was fun to watch.

41
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,311
Did you see that?
She thought it was for her.

42
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,272
"Get out of my way."

43
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,567
What?

44
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,862
Hey, I told you. It was my grandma.

45
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,740
Your grandma…

46
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,328
Yes. It was my grandma.

47
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,167
I wonder how she managed to get through.

48
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,088
I heard you barely get through
even though you call for two hours on end.

49
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,516
A dormitory with 360 students,

50
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,436
and only two phones. How ridiculous.

51
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:16,149
The upside of it, though,
is that we get to improve our running.

52
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,277
I doubt that.
Two days ago, I ran as fast as I could

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,196
only to see Bun-ok
hang up the call in front of me.

54
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,157
Saying 30 seconds was over.

55
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,410
I guess Gizzard treats us differently.

56
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,620
She doesn't dare hang up calls for me.

57
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,456
The call was for you.

58
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,042
You weren't in the room,
so I went there to…

59
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,084
Just eat.

60
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,337
What?

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,922
She hung up a call for me?

62
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,717
Darn it. Who does
that Gizzard think she is?

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,511
Stop calling her Gizzard.
Watch what you say.

64
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,763
She has a name.

65
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,809
There you go again, pretending to be nice.

66
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,438
What did you say?

67
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,900
Gye Bun-ok means chicken, poop, and house.

68
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,276
In one word, it's "gizzard."

69
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,990
Her name actually means "fragrant bead."

70
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,867
Okay, Hye-ja?

71
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,663
Hey!

72
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,208
You wench.

73
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,961
I told you, my name is Ko Hye-ryeong!

74
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,048
I told you numerous times
that I changed my name.

75
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,259
How will you oust the dictator?

76
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,137
My goodness, don't make me laugh.

77
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,431
Look. Why don't you come to your senses

78
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,725
and fight for your fellow students
in our dorm?

79
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,395
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

80
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,823
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

81
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,664
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

82
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,165
Yeong-ro.

83
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:01,003
"You will never defeat us. Not even once."

84
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,464
"God won't allow it,

85
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,591
and neither will Eom-ji."

86
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,557
I must say, this comic book isn't
about baseball but about romance.

87
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,236
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

88
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,370
<i>He sure is shameless.</i>

89
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,746
Really shameless.

90
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,207
He'll attend this year too?

91
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,544
Okay. Keep a close eye on him.

92
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,838
Were you talking about Eun?

93
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,925
He didn't even take part in the revolution

94
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,802
but wants to be a member of the Society?

95
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,680
That's just absurd.

96
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,725
SECRETARY-GENERAL OF AEMIN PARTY
NAM TAE-IL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 2

97
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,935
You wicked little fox.

98
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,521
You sure know exactly how I feel.

99
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,482
You're going to be late.

100
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,318
-You should get there before Code 1 does.
-Yes, I should.

101
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,945
Eun Chang-su is definitely a liability.

102
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,780
How could he not see that?

103
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,908
It's so frustrating.

104
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,462
DIRECTOR OF ANSP
EUN CHANG-SU, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 3

105
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>I know he's your predecessor as director,</i>

106
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,217
but he's four years your junior.

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,638
We can't let people think
that you bow to Nam Tae-il, can we?

108
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,516
At today's gathering,

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,435
you should show him who's boss.

110
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,231
Okay, honey?

111
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,207
Present arms.

112
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,708
-Salute!
-Salute!

113
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,526
Attention. Present arms.

114
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,111
-Salute!
-Salute!

115
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,205
Sir.

116
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,416
You came early.

117
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,625
Hello.

118
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,085
It's good to see you.

119
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,420
-How have you been?
-Good.

120
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,339
-All right. Let's have a seat.
-Sure, let's.

121
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,426
HEAD OF AEMIN PARTY
PARK MU-YEOL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 1

122
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,970
DONGSIM SOCIETY

123
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,065
My goodness. It's been a while, everyone.

124
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,416
Look at this bastard…

125
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
The president is coming.

126
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,429
Attention!

127
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,142
Present arms!

128
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,814
Order arms!

129
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,369
All right. Let us all have a glass first.

130
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,297
Sir! Let me give the toast today.

131
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,807
To the 30th anniversary
of Dongsim Society,

132
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,226
and to the president and our nation!

133
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,766
<i>How's Operation Phoenix going?</i>

134
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,311
Yes. We'll make it look like
the North abducts Professor Han I-seop,

135
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,854
the economic brains,

136
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,441
and the opposition party runs
for president with the North's funding.

137
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,152
If word is out that they're running
with the Communists' money,

138
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,322
the opposition party
will lose the election for sure.

139
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
It can't go awry.

140
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,077
It won't. It's going smoothly.

141
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,789
We're making sure that
a peaceful handover of power is possible.

142
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,998
Possible?

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,337
For you, the honorable leader,
and our Aemin Party,

144
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,965
I swear on my life
that our party will retake power!

145
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,515
You're indeed something else, Tae-il.

146
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,892
As the head of the campaign,

147
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,395
you should guide Director Eun well.

148
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,523
I will, sir.

149
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,076
Hello, ma'am. It's good to see you.

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,662
You're here too, ma'am.
Please come inside.

151
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,505
Oh, my.

152
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,259
How amazing!

153
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,429
I knew it. You were born elegant,

154
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,308
so you look like an elegant French woman.
You look perfect in it.

155
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,518
WIFE OF EUN CHANG-SU, HONG AE-RA

156
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,603
And what do you think, Mrs. Hong?

157
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,147
You look so beautiful.

158
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,069
A wife of an officer or a politician

159
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:26,156
should have her own fashion style.

160
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,701
Why do you think?

161
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,077
WIFE OF NAM TAE-IL, CHO SEONG-SIM

162
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,037
Well…

163
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,542
To become a fashion icon
and show everyone--

164
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,336
No, that's not it.

165
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,260
To win…

166
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,640
the hearts of the public.

167
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,022
Because one's fashion,
especially a politician's wife's fashion,

168
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,026
is like a message to the people.

169
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,111
What does one's fashion mean?

170
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,571
-A message.
-A message.

171
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,169
Thank you.

172
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,713
Ma'am.

173
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,094
For your birthday party,

174
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,765
would you like to wear <i>hanbok</i> or a dress?

175
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,268
A dress. But I don't want it
to be too much.

176
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,187
Not too unique.

177
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,980
You know what I mean.

178
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,442
I do. Like something
the First Lady would wear.

179
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,695
As you wish, ma'am.

180
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,785
You're so thoughtful, ma'am.

181
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,417
I wish you could be
as thoughtful, Mrs. Hong.

182
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,587
But then, she used to be an actress.

183
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,554
Yes, ranks are what matter
in the military,

184
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,682
but you know it's different in politics.

185
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,977
Code 1's faith in you
determines your power and rank.

186
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:23,732
And Mr. Eun seems
to keep forgetting that simple truth.

187
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,737
Perhaps you could help him remember that.

188
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,203
He can be quite straightforward.

189
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,998
I guess he's made
a mistake to your husband.

190
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,795
Please tell Mr. Nam that we're so sorry.

191
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,716
You know I'm always on your side.

192
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,680
Anyway, you're
three years older than me, right?

193
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,143
As far as I know, she's four years older.

194
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,519
Right?

195
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,730
Oh, my.

196
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,607
You're four years older than me?

197
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,822
Well, our ages don't matter.
Our husbands' ranks do.

198
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,915
My, Mrs. Hong.
You look much younger than your age.

199
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,753
Charlotte, I'd like to pay for the dress.

200
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,090
Sorry.

201
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,018
My goodness, ma'am.
You know you don't have to pay.

202
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,770
Ms. Kim, here.

203
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,314
I'm just honored to make a dress for you.

204
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,319
How dare that little wench…

205
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,745
WELCOME BACK, MR. LEE GANG-MU

206
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,128
Mr. Lee Gang-mu?

207
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,723
It's an honor, Mr. Lee.

208
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,894
To pick you up, the legendary Black Tiger.

209
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,029
COSMOS TOYS

210
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,632
CHIEF AN GYEONG-HUI

211
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,617
APPRECIATION AWARD
PRESENTED TO AN GYEONG-HUI

212
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,453
ANSP

213
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,509
Here, ma'am. The photo's come out.

214
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,094
Good.

215
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,024
INFORMATION

216
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,696
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

217
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,139
And the evidence?

218
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,391
In Hyeseong Hotel--

219
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
Who'd dare bug the chief's office?

220
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,403
Didn't you read
the opposition party's interviews?

221
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,405
Apparently, their moles
are all over this place.

222
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,450
They're even confident
of getting hold of top secret documents.

223
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,619
You must know the man's the Crown Prince.

224
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,703
And the women…

225
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,791
I'll take care of this case.

226
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,668
So get your hands off it.

227
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,547
Listen. How about dinner tonight?
It's been a while.

228
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,216
With other alumni.

229
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,637
Black Tiger's back.

230
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,641
Lee Gang-mu. You know him well, right?

231
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,603
That brat. He sure is a workaholic.

232
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,730
He wants to brief me right away.

233
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,711
<i>From the look of things,</i>

234
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,462
<i>he's been winning them over</i>

235
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,633
<i>while moving from one lab to another
and using different identities.</i>

236
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,221
He murders Koreans who try
to escape while being moved to the North

237
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,974
without even caring about
the German intelligence agencies.

238
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,435
Brutally in cold blood.

239
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,063
And while chasing him,

240
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,733
one of our agents…

241
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,613
GERMANY
2 YEARS AGO

242
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,785
Let go of me!

243
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,464
Hello, sir.

244
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,398
-No!
-Leave us alone!

245
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,904
The next cabin!

246
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
Move aside, Jin-seong.

247
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,759
PRIVATE PROPERTY

248
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,764
Jin-seong.

249
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,642
Jin-seong!

250
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,519
Jin-seong.

251
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,521
No, Jin-seong…

252
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,985
Jin-seong!

253
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,862
His face,

254
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,366
name, and age are all unknown.

255
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,744
Next.

256
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,746
This is his code name.

257
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,125
And we got intel that he snuck into Seoul.

258
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,336
Then you came back to Korea
to catch Taedong River 1?

259
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,930
He's been acting secretly
all over Germany,

260
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,558
and now he's in Seoul.

261
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,819
He either has to win someone over in Seoul

262
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,239
or he was given a mission
the agents here can't pull off.

263
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,032
In any case,

264
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,828
we must get him
before he accomplishes his mission.

265
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,165
It's much more urgent
than catching small-fry spies.

266
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,708
All right.

267
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,585
Any volunteers?

268
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,504
Who wants to work with Gang-mu?

269
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,547
Me.

270
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,550
-I want to do it.
-Oh Dong-jae. And?

271
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,677
-I want in.
-So do I.

272
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,804
-Any more?
-I want in.

273
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,515
-I want in.
-So do I.

274
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,022
-What the hell?
-What?

275
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,274
-What is it?
-What's going on?

276
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,026
What's going on?

277
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,081
Is that what I should do to him?

278
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,459
TAEDONG RIVER 1

279
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,590
God, that nutcase.

280
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,343
Put your guns down.

281
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,804
I said, put your guns away!

282
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Well…

283
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,102
Sorry about that. You must be startled.

284
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,104
She's our very first female agent.

285
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,898
She's obviously not trained properly.

286
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:29,277
Well, she may be hot-tempered,
but she's really good at her job.

287
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,946
Her nickname's One Hundred Warriors.

288
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,948
-Right?
-I don't need her.

289
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,283
I only need disciplined ones.

290
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,925
You little…

291
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,510
Have you gone mad?

292
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,727
Oh, my. He's so handsome
that I can never get sick of him.

293
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,939
Oh, my. He's killing me.

294
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,525
You should grill it nice and crisp.

295
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,027
Careful. You're going to burn it.

296
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,613
God, you and your nagging. You do it then.

297
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,658
I'm not nagging. I'm just teaching you.

298
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,453
I bet you only ate sausages in Germany.
What do you know about pork belly?

299
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,454
Germany?

300
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,582
What? Then he's a Korean-German?

301
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:28,044
Didn't you know? He's a graduate student
of economics at Berlin University.

302
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,797
Oh, my goodness. For real?

303
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,966
I heard he came to write a thesis

304
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,801
on Park Chung-hee's
Economic Development Plan.

305
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,927
Really?

306
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,596
-He's so cool!
-That's amazing.

307
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,973
These lettuce leaves are really…

308
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,561
Come on, Gwang-tae.
You should grill the meat.

309
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,105
Why do you make Soo-ho do all the work?

310
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,566
He didn't pass the exam. I did.

311
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,652
I, Oh Gwang-tae,
am the star of the day, aren't I?

312
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,029
Look at this guy.

313
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,365
You only passed the first round.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

314
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,200
Oh, my goodness.

315
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,537
-Hey.
-Our stingy Ms. Bong may say mean words,

316
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,872
but she cares a lot for me.

317
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,749
Look how she threw
this barbecue party for me.

318
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,586
You're three months behind on rent.

319
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,422
Why would I throw
a barbecue party for you?

320
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,301
You should learn from him, you brat.

321
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,012
Soo-ho paid for all this
to congratulate you.

322
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,388
-What?
-What?

323
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,599
-Let me do it.
-What?

324
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,934
-You're the best.
-What are you doing?

325
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,187
-Pour him a drink.
-Sure.

326
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,689
-But you said you're the star of the day.
-No, you are.

327
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,609
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
100TH ANNIVERSARY

328
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,115
15 MINUTES BEFORE DORM ROLL CALL

329
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,033
Sorry!

330
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,954
-No!
-Run!

331
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,208
Run!

332
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,211
What is it that you want to say?

333
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,885
You know what that means.

334
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,470
Hye-ryeong!

335
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,697
This is my heart.

336
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,324
What's going on?

337
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,327
My heart is burning
like the sun for you, Hye-ryeong.

338
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,871
Please accept it.

339
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,250
Hye-ryeong!

340
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,169
Ten minutes…

341
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,087
What?

342
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,674
We only have ten minutes.

343
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,509
Hye-ryeong.

344
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,595
Hye-ryeong!

345
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,312
Wait for me!

00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,001
INDEPENDENT HOSU, ONE HOSU, UNITED HOSU

347
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,506

348
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
No!

349
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,287
-Hye-ryeong. Hurry!
-Darn it.

350
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,580
Damn it!

351
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,625
Hye-ryeong. Hurry!

352
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,252
-Hurry!
-Darn it.

353
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,088
Good. Run!

354
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,133
Run!

355
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,012
What? No.

356
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,811
-What?
-Just leave it. Hurry.

357
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,023
But it's from Grandma.

358
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,234
Darn it.

359
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,246
Hey! Move!

360
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,462
Jeong-min.

361
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,130
Five minutes left.

362
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,223
Yeong-ro and Hye-ryeong haven't come back.

363
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,850
What? Both of them?

364
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,935
Be careful.

365
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,645
-Careful.
-Hello.

366
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,314
-Hello.
-Be careful. You might hurt yourself.

367
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,401
My goodness.

368
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,196
KEEP IT BRIEF

369
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,491
Damn it.

370
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,079
Why isn't she here yet?

371
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,291
This is bad.

372
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,206
Hye-ryeong!

373
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,543
Gosh.

374
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,128
What about Yeong-ro?

375
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,883
Yeong-ro!

376
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:13,473
My, what happened to her?
It's already nine.

377
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,724
Mr. Kim.

378
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,186
-What are you doing here?
-What?

379
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,272
Oh, Yeong-ro's not back yet.

380
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,650
-Yeong-ro?
-Yes.

381
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,908
-Oh, no. If the hall director sees her…
-Come on. Hurry!

382
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,957
-Sure. I should close the door.
-Hurry.

383
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,834
-Okay.
-This is why I hate working with him.

384
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,009
Hello, ma'am.

385
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,810
Wait.

386
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,440
Ma'am. About what happened yesterday…

387
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,069
The hall director is over there.

388
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,320
Hide.

389
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,823
Hide.

390
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,326
All right, then. I'll do it accordingly.

391
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,832
No.

392
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,754
Make sure to close it exactly on the hour.

393
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,506
I will, ma'am.

394
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,968
It shouldn't be
even a second later than that.

395
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,388
Sure, ma'am.

396
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,056
DORM MAIN DOOR

397
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,183
Have you fixed the chairs in the sauna?

398
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,853
I'm going to.

399
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,190
There are so many things
the students ask me to fix, so…

400
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,361
I'll get it done soon.

401
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,202
My goodness.

402
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,996
What do we do?

403
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,622
Just follow her for now.

404
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874
Darn it.

405
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,631
Yeong-ro.

406
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,968
Yeong-ro? Where did she go?

407
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,721
What's that?

408
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,150
My goodness.

409
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,538
How could you leave her behind?

410
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,248
I missed roll call twice already.

411
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,625
What could I do?

412
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,296
So did she pass the dorm main gate or not?

413
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,423
I don't know!
I just ran without looking back.

414
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,175
-Ko Hye-ryeong!
-What?

415
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,510
Now…

416
00:34:55,593 --> 00:35:00,264
we're all going to get kicked out,
aren't we?

417
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,975
Stop whining and get ready for roll call.

418
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,144
Okay.

419
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,794
Say good night.

420
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,754
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

421
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
Say good night.

422
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,022
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

423
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,039
I'm sorry, ma'am.

424
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,994
Hurry and get inside.

425
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,168
CHOCO BALLS

426
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,171
Say good night.

427
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,465
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

428
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,672
Say good night.

429
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,548
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

430
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,179
Go! Go now!

431
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,233
What?

432
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,693
Hurry!

433
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,449
This is why I told her to leave it.

434
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,201
Why did she have to go to pick it up?

435
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,661
-I can't believe her.
-Hye-ryeong.

436
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,873
It may not be a problem for a rich girl
like you, but if we're kicked out--

437
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,335
Yeong-ro might not be able
to afford to rent a room.

438
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,586
What do you know?

439
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,631
She gave out rice cakes
to everyone on the day she moved in.

440
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,717
Her family runs a rice cake store!
She relies on scholarships.

441
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,844
She answers phone calls with Bun-ok.

442
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,353
Guys.

443
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,855
Open it.

444
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,982
-My goodness.
-Open the window.

445
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,693
-Say good night.
-Good night, ma'am.

446
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,863
Darn it.

447
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,081
-What…
-Rat.

448
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,876
I just saw a rat!

449
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,170
-Rat!
-Where?

450
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,589
No. This way!

451
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,299
Get her pajamas.

452
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,512
Where?

453
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,681
-Where?
-This way!

454
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,932
That way!

455
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,227
There's a rat! Grab a broom!

456
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,482
Yeong-ro, give me your bag.

457
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,577
Lift your foot.

458
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,956
Thank you.

459
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,878
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,258
Well…

461
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,930
-Go.
-Let's get back.

462
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,932
-Move.
-I hate rats!

463
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,352
Yeong-ro, hurry.

464
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,686
I'm almost done.

465
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,656
Well, I could've sworn
that I saw a rat there.

466
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,033
I definitely saw one going in there.

467
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,328
Don't you know the dorm rules?

468
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,163
How dare you scream like that?

469
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,124
I'm sorry, ma'am.

470
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,295
You said you saw it,
so make sure to catch it.

471
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,138
By myself?

472
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,326
Eun Yeong-ro.

473
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,287
Yes, ma'am?

474
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,832
Why are you sweating so much?

475
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,880
Well, I ran really hard
to not be late for roll call.

476
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,424
So why did you have to stay out late?

477
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,594
What if your roommates
get kicked out because of you?

478
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,307
I'm sorry. I won't stay out late again.

479
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,269
Room 207.

480
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,564
Recite the dorm rules.

481
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,399
-Abide by the curfew.
-Abide by the curfew.

482
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,193
-No protest. No sleeping out.
-No protest. No sleeping out.

483
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,652
Again.

484
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,779
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.

485
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,948
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.

486
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,366
You know…

487
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,537
your room only has one chance left, right?

488
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,747
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

489
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,457
That'll be all.

490
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,709
Say good night.

491
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

492
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,102
How did you think of climbing the wall?

493
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
Don't get me started.

494
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,109
Wait. I forgot the rice cakes.

495
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,537
I wonder Yeong-ro managed to get in.

496
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,206
What?

497
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,124
Mr. Kim.

498
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,125
Look who's here.

499
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,255
So you didn't get caught, Yeong-ro.

500
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,966
That's great!

501
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,179
You were right. He brought it in.

502
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,014
I told you he would.

503
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,100
He can fix or unlock anything.

504
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,643
Of course.

505
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,438
I may be old,
but I'm a jack of all trades.

506
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,943
I bet you're hungry.

507
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,196
Ta-da. They're oat rice cakes.

508
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,323
They're supposed to be good for diabetes.

509
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,076
Oh, my. I'm so grateful.

510
00:42:59,159 --> 00:42:59,994
Hey!

511
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,413
We should go back to our room.

512
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,956
Sure, you should.

513
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,125
Oh, right. Hold on.

514
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,546
Can you give this to Bun-ok on the way?

515
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,799
Tell her I'll smash it
if she asks me to fix it again.

516
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,384
It's such a nuisance.

517
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,719
I will.

518
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,513
-Good night.
-Good night.

519
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,891
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

520
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,229
Right. Hold it for me for a second.

521
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,238
Bun-ok, it's been fixed.

522
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,282
I almost forgot about it.

523
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,994
And this is the honey rice cake you love.

524
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,830
Oh, right.
It was your grandma's birthday, right?

525
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,123
Thank you.

526
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,459
Wait. Bun-ok…

527
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,005
Thank you so much for earlier.

528
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,841
The hall director told me to catch a rat.

529
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,052
By myself, since I'm the one who saw it.

530
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,679
-Really?
-What a wench.

531
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,473
I hope she goes somewhere and drops--

532
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,185
Yes, really.

533
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
I'm so sorry, Bun-ok.

534
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,856
Well, I'll have to put on a show again.

535
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,068
I'll beg her saying
I must've seen wrong or cry my heart out.

536
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,536
If you're that sorry,
would you do me a favor?

537
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,499
What is it?
Just name it. I'll do anything.

538
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,965
Get me the English edition
of <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

539
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,718
English edition?

540
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,140
What? Is that so surprising?

541
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,102
Because I want an English edition
when I'm not even a college student?

542
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,438
No. That's not what I was thinking.

543
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,899
Even English literature majors
don't read them much.

544
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:58,654
You know how it is.
They're not even that good at English.

545
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,121
I'll give you a copy tomorrow.
I recently bought one.

546
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,581
See you tomorrow then.

547
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,794
Right.

548
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,339
Let's go.

549
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,225
What do you think is in that room?

550
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,145
What are you talking about?

551
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,731
Come on. Something's really fishy.

552
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:39,111
She opened the door just a crack
in case you looked inside.

553
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,243
Stop talking nonsense and give that to me.

554
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,327
Let's run.

555
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,621
Hey!

556
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,836
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

557
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,264
COSMOS TOYS

558
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,349
<i>This man</i>

559
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,352
is likely to have helped
Taedong River 1 with his mission.

560
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,771
And there's no record
that he came into Korea, so…

561
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,234
Damn it.

562
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,324
-Why didn't you tell me about this?
-I'm sure I said that I don't need you.

563
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,078
Who's this guy?

564
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,625
Is he someone connected
to Taedong River 1?

565
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,171
I'll handle Professor Han I-seop.

566
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,592
He's the brains of Choi Dae-yeong,
the leader of the opposition party.

567
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
I met him a few times
while monitoring him.

568
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,683
Are you going to keep a close eye
on him when he knows your face?

569
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,479
Oh, that?

570
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,233
He thinks I'm a journalist who was fired.

571
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,738
Who was fired
for strongly condemning the ruling party.

572
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,997
I can infiltrate deep into their party.

573
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,631
This is amazing.
It's the guy I met with you guys!

574
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
That's amazing!

575
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,384
Hurry!

576
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,262
-Really?
-Oh, my God!

577
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,555
Let's go open it.

578
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,777
TO YEONG-U

579
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,321
How could he…

580
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,073
He doesn't take a leave or write me back.

581
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,038
HOW COULD YOU

582
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
I swear I'll…

583
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
You're so mean, Yeong-u.

584
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,242
Come on. Guys in the military
never write back to their sisters.

585
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,577
Only to their girlfriends.

586
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,371
TIMESHEET

587
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,290
But he doesn't have a girlfriend.

588
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,626
He only thinks about me,

589
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,878
so my grandma's so worried about him.

590
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,005
He's in the military.
I'm sure he's doing well.

591
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,926
But he's not just in the…

592
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:36,598
Bun-ok.

593
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,986
Thanks.

594
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,404
Hello?

595
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,406
How do I look?

596
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,409
-Pardon?
-Do I look cool?

597
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,249
People will think I'm
a college girl, right?

598
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,257
No, it's okay.

599
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,093
Hey, keep it short, will you?
The phone's not yours.

600
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,222
Babe, I'm afraid I've got to go.

601
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,932
What? Yes.

602
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,936
Then see you at Harmony at six.

603
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,187
Okay, babe.

604
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,568
What the…

605
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,165
ASPIRING TO BECOME A WORLD-FAMOUS
OPERA SINGER, KO HYE-RYEONG

606
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,343
This is Hosu Women's University Dormitory.

607
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,015
I heard Ms. Ko Hye-ryeong,

608
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,894
a senior in Voice and Music major,
Hosu's Prima Donna who will

609
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,522
become a world-famous opera singer,
stays in Room 207.

610
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,232
Is that true?

611
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,151
Yes, it is.

612
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,787
This is Oh Gwang-tae who stays
in Room 207 at Haedal Boarding House,

613
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:26,708
whose residents have passed
the most difficult national exams.

614
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,961
More than those of any other houses.

615
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:32,881
And?

616
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,136
Could I speak to any lady of Room 207?

617
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,056
I'm afraid no one
in that room is here right now.

618
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,600
If you leave a message to me,
I'll make sure they get it.

619
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,690
A group blind date?

620
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,736
A group blind date?

621
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,405
Hold on. Yes, go on.

622
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,367
This Saturday.

623
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,494
At three o'clock. Hold on.

624
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,746
At Rome Coffee Shop
in front of Hosu Women's University?

625
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,790
Wait a second.

626
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,752
The girls of Room 207 might turn it down.
You can't just tell them to come.

627
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,839
We will wait there until they come.

628
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,841
Please tell them that.

629
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,802
Oh, and four girls live
in the room, right?

630
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,013
-Yes.
-Good. Thank you.

631
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,225
HAEDAL BOARDING HOUSE

632
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,769
-You did it!
-This is great!

633
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,020
I love you!

634
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,151
We're going on
a group blind date thanks to Hye-ryeong.

635
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,236
She's indeed
the most popular girl in the school.

636
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,364
But I don't think Jeong-min will go.

637
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,493
Then you're one girl short.

638
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,290
This is a women's university.
I'm sure we'll find one.

639
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,208
How about me?

640
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,919
I live in the dorm too.

641
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,423
Pardon?

642
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,926
Wait, Gwang-tae. Four girls are coming,

643
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,303
but we're three.

644
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,683
Soo-ho!

645
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,689
Do you have time this Saturday?
No, you must.

646
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,984
Why are you always like that?
What is it this time?

647
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,280
Soo-ho, you know that I never got to date
because I was too busy studying.

648
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,407
If it's about
a group blind date again, forget it.

649
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:26,995
But it's Hosu.

650
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,246
Go away.

651
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,540
Hosu's Maria Callas is coming.

652
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,626
Go away! Now!

653
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,544
Fine.

654
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,422
Then I won't set you up
with Professor Han.

655
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,885
You have a lot of questions for him.
Say goodbye to your thesis.

656
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,935
So they're from Hosu Women's University?

657
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,189
Just one day…

658
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,982
I don't wish for more.

659
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:00,237
I just want to live
as a college girl for one day.

660
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,077
I guess that's too much to ask for.

661
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,546
It's too much, isn't it?

662
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,300
It's not.

663
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,972
Then will you convince Hye-ryeong for me?

664
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,516
Okay.

665
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,977
<i>She's ridiculous.</i>

666
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,688
She wants to join us?

667
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,023
Does she have no self-respect?

668
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,110
She wants to pretend
to be a college girl that badly?

669
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,198
I can understand her.

670
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,410
When you hear guys asking girls out
over the phone often enough,

671
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,454
you become envious
and want to go on a date too.

672
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,373
Don't you think?

673
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,917
But not this time.

674
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,836
That's deceiving the guys.

675
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,213
You're right!

676
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,215
I totally agree with you.

677
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,846
But we avoided a disaster
during roll call thanks to Bun-ok.

678
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,599
Well, that is true, but…

679
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,810
But we shouldn't lie to the guys.

680
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,397
God, I can never like you.

681
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,524
How hard is it to join us for once?

682
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,485
You guys go have a lot of fun.

683
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,905
Do you think I'm going because I want to?

684
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,575
I just want to make fun memories
for the freshmen.

685
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,541
Ms. Ko.

686
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,546
I prepared it for you.

687
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,178
Wait. Hye-ryeong, wait.

688
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:54,434
As you said, it's really wrong
to lie to the guys.

689
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,730
It may be nothing special for us,
but it is her dream.

690
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,817
Just this once. Please?

691
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,739
No.

692
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,867
What if…

693
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,787
Well, I doubt she'll go that far…

694
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,041
but what if she won't take
any calls for you?

695
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,926
Go tell her I'll allow it just this once.

696
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,677
Make it clear.

697
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,889
Thank you, Hye-ryeong.

698
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
Fun memories?

699
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,442
Are you sure it's not because of
the guy who passed the national exam?

700
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,905
What's so wrong about that?

701
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,241
It's a human instinct to try to find

702
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,035
as good a life partner as possible.

703
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,291
<i>"The guy who passed the national exam"?</i>

704
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,589
It's a human instinct. It's very natural.

705
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,676
Oh, my God! We're really doing this!

706
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,762
By a good partner, you mean
a woman with a good background, right?

707
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,514
Of course.

708
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,101
Only lowlifes marry for love.

709
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:22,939
The ruling class only marries for money.
That's what Engels said.

710
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,275
So using the fact
that you passed the first round,

711
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,069
you're trying to court Hye-ryeong
who you're sure is bourgeois?

712
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,573
You pathetic punk.

713
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,450
You have to keep your word. I mean…

714
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,411
you can't choose Hye-ryeong.

715
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,039
I'm sure she'll choose me,
but just in case.

716
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,668
Fine, I won't. But you have to set me up
with Professor Han properly, okay?

717
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,628
Of course, I will.

718
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,761
What are you going to use as your item?

719
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,805
What? What item?

720
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,434
God, I can't believe you.

721
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,188
What's the point
of going to Berlin University?

722
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,189
Let me see.

723
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,773
What are you looking for?

724
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,442
What are you doing?

725
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,985
Later…

726
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,612
This is a designer wallet.

727
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,697
-What are you doing?
-I mean…

728
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,492
don't take out
something like this luxury pen.

729
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,205
What? This is perfect.

730
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,250
Soo-ho, this is just perfect. Use it.

731
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,920
A meeting with Professor Han.

732
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,671
Yes. I already told you.

733
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,466
This is really happening!

734
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,262
Hye-ryeong, it's ten to three.

735
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,764
I know.

736
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,017
Bun-ok said she'd be
at Rome Coffee Shop by three.

737
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,770
She must've stopped by some salon, right?

738
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,523
It's just putting pearls on a pig, though.

739
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,736
Should I help with this--

740
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,910
They just told us to be there
by three without asking us.

741
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,454
So why do we have to be there
by the time they set?

742
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,166
Romantic relationships begin
with a tug-of-war.

743
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,752
And the best way to win is

744
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,629
to make the guy desperate.

745
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,172
Got it?

746
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,016
ROME COFFEE SHOP

747
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,105
ROME COFFEE SHOP

748
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,982
Darn it.

749
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,400
They're still not here.

750
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,487
-It's them.
-Really?

751
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,322
-Hello.
-Hi.

752
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,407
Welcome.

753
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,201
This way, please.

754
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,205
-It's them.
-Really?

755
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,958
-Hello.
-Not again.

756
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,253
When will they come?

757
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,005
I don't know.

758
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,966
How could they be so late?

759
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,892
Oh Gwang-tae?

760
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,148
-No, I'm--
-Hye-ryeong!

761
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,429
What a shame.

762
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,477
It is. One more match,
and it would've been completed.

763
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,273
But…

764
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,776
only the three of you came?

765
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,693
Three?

766
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,073
Oh, she's not here yet?

767
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,784
She definitely promised to come by three.

768
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,329
I'm sorry. I guess
something urgent came up for her.

769
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,539
One of your guys
will have to do without a partner.

770
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,418
Yeong-ro!

771
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,257
Bun-ok.

772
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,430
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,101
Hi.

774
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,815
I'm so sorry I'm late.

775
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,192
Sorry, guys.
Did you introduce yourselves yet?

776
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,611
We didn't, but--

777
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,157
I'm a senior studying English Literature
at Hosu University.

778
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,909
My name is…

779
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,787
Gye Seong.

780
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,926
Enjoy.

781
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,180
All right. Now that all of us are here,

782
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,015
-please introduce yourselves.
-Wait.

783
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,352
How about we decide on our partners first?

784
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,276
You see, I have two tickets
to a music concert.

785
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,652
If I'm to be there on time,

786
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,904
I should get going soon.

787
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:26,659
And I was hoping
to go there with one of the guys here.

788
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,411
Cutting to the chase. I love it.

789
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,247
All right, then. How about you girls
pick among our items?

790
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,165
No.

791
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,710
Since she's in such a hurry,

792
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,254
we girls will take out our items.

793
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,299
So that a guy who wants
to go with her can pick hers.

794
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,135
Let's do that! I agree…

795
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,847
with Hye-ryeong.

796
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,976
Come on, Seol-hui.
Isn't that too boring and direct?

797
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,730
I'd rather leave it to fate.

798
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,981
Right?

799
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,986
I also think
we should let fate decide for us.

800
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,531
I agree with you!
What's fun about it if it's so obvious?

801
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,409
Let's let fate decide for us.
All right, then.

802
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,996
Could you girls please close your eyes?

803
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,581
And guys.

804
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,540
-Yes?
-Yes?

805
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,459
Take out your items.

806
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,886
EXAM PASS CERTIFICATE

807
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,430
Now open your eyes, please.

808
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,145
That's a paper airplane.

809
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,818
What? This is perfect.

810
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,986
Use it.

811
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,161
Why don't you pick first, Hye-ryeong?

812
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,759
Oh, my. What exam is this certificate for?

813
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,097
It's for the Civil Service Exam.

814
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,933
I passed the first round.

815
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,274
-The first round?
-Yes, the first round.

816
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,026
Seol-hui.

817
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:26,737
Okay.

818
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,074
-You pick first.
-What?

819
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,202
Me first?

820
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:29,967
Come on, Yeong-ro.
Since I'm older, I should pick first.

821
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:55,409
EVERGREEN BOOKSTORE

822
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,401
She is really Yeong-ro.

823
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,278
I can't tell her.

824
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,797
LISTENING BOOTH

825
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,684
She must be so embarrassed.

826
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,896
She's leaving.

827
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,551
What about Bun-ok?

828
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,556
I mean, Seong. Where's Seong?

829
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,768
Didn't you go
to the music concert with her?

830
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,980
No, since I'm quite busy.

831
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,902
And you? Did you part ways already?

832
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,452
Yes, since I'm quite busy too.

833
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,131
-How much is it? Hurry!
-How much is what?

834
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,365
How much is it? Hurry!

835
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,574
It's 2,500 won.

836
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,762
I'm sorry. I'll buy it next time.

837
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,062
Seriously?

838
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,317
I can't believe this.

839
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,402
Excuse me.

840
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,545
What's this?

841
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,047
Didn't you come to buy this?

842
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,595
Why are you giving it to me?

843
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,140
Because we met earlier.

844
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,186
Just take it.

845
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,272
But…

846
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,441
Wait.

847
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,070
Hey!

848
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:01,906
Hey!

849
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,125
What year did you start?

850
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,461
Don't you dare lie.

851
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,046
Are you sure?

852
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,757
-Hey.
-You there!

853
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,430
I can't take it.

854
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:30,726
It wasn't like that.

855
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,979
What? What are you doing?

856
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,314
Just a minute, please.

857
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,210
You jerk!

858
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,798
You went to the music concert with Seong.
You think I don't know that?

859
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,092
Am I wrong? Tell me if I am!

860
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,094
-Tell me!
-I didn't.

861
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,845
Tell me what happened then.

862
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,417
Let's go.

863
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,185
The police are gone.

864
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,090
Are you all right?

865
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,980
You could be an actress.

866
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,858
Not a singer, though.

867
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,992
My big brother was
once arrested at a protest.

868
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,620
So…

869
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,333
I see.

870
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,128
I should get going.

871
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,594
Wait. Just a minute.

872
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,353
Do you want

873
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:21,939
to have dinner…

874
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,290
Thank you.

875
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,477
I hate to be indebted to other people.

876
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:07,025
So let me return the favor.
Meet me at Rome Coffee Shop tomorrow.

877
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,030
At three. Okay?

878
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,869
You have to come. Okay?

879
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,177
<i>Clean the chair properly too, okay?</i>

880
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,845
Sure, sure.

881
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,681
And be careful
not to leave your footprints.

882
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,016
Got it.

883
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,976
Yeong-ro…

884
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,859
Hey, don't run!

885
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,915
I wondered what it'd feel like

886
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,668
to fall in love at first sight.

01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,435

<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

897
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,368
He's recently been seen
quite often around Professor Han.

898
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,454
He's known as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University.

899
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,749
I've checked it with the university,
and there's no student…

900
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,502
by that name.

901
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:41,341
NO REGISTRATION FOUND

902
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,843

903
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,595
As of now, he's likely
to be Taedong River 1.

904
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,639
Keep a close eye on him at all times.

905
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,724

Geum-cheol.

910
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,503
-Professor.
-Yes?

911
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:21,631
-Are you going home now?
-Hey, Soo-ho. You're still here?

912
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,594
Oh, my. This looks quite serious.

913
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,477
It's nice of you to give me a ride.
Thank you.

914
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:37,439
They're coming.

915
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,238
The river's finally flowing. Over.

916
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:01,963
Comrade Joo.

917
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,465
Comrade Joo.

918
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,300
Geum-cheol.

919
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:06,885
Geum-cheol!

920
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:13,934
Professor!

921
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,858
Comrade Joo!

922
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,778
Run. Go!

923
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,582
Lim Soo-ho.

924
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,127
Follow me.

925
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:56,726
<i>-Pine tree, pine tree, green pine tree

-Don't be shaken by an east wind</i>

927
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,064
Soo-ho, you bastard!

928
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:04,442
<i>-Beneath bars of the prison

931
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,240
Lim Soo-ho!

932
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,409
-Fair election!
-Fair election!

933
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,827
Stop!

934
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,203
Lim Soo-ho!

935
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,214
-Fight.
-Fight.

936
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,758
-Fight.
-Fight.

937
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,555
FAIR ELECTION

938
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,104
-Oh, my goodness.
-That's scary.

939
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,901
They're shooting so many tear bombs today.

940
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:53,033
Aemin Party's election campaign
is happening at Songchon Rotary.

941
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,786
I hope she comes back safely.

942
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,538
You mean Jeong-min?

943
01:21:58,622 --> 01:21:59,581
Yes.

944
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,875
I hope so too.

945
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,379
EVERGREEN BOOKSTORE

946
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:08,632
Hurry!

947
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,468
-Run!
-Run!

948
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:15,597
-One, two!
-One, two!

949
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,268
-One, two!
-One, two!

950
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,861
Seung-jun.

951
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,333
Let's go to the dorm.

952
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:19,828
Out of the way!

953
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,917
Seung-jun, this way. Dong-jae, that way.

954
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,546
Hey, you can't…

955
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,141
I'm so scared.

956
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,177
Who are you people?

957
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,514
We need to search the dorm right now.

958
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,642
What's this about?

959
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,645
A man who's been shot is hiding in here.

960
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,897
Show me a search warrant.

961
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,235
-Without a warrant, I won't let--
-Look.

962
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,989
We're chasing a North Korean spy!

963
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,618
Without a warrant, I can't allow
any man in this girls' dormitory.

964
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,721
If you don't let us,

965
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:05,350
you'll be violating National Security Law.

966
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:07,435
You know that?

967
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:10,980
You're in Hosu Women's University!

968
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:13,525
-According to our dorm rules--
-Are you kidding?

969
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,485
We don't have time for this.

970
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:23,868
Let's just go in.

971
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,454
Jeong-min!

972
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:27,831
Search thoroughly.

973
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,290
Yes, sir.

974
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:09,873
Hey.

975
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,687
<i>Do you recognize me?</i>

976
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,647
Didn't you hear? He's a North Korean spy.

977
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,815
He's not a spy.

978
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,775
<i>So you want to keep him in the dorm?</i>

979
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,361
<i>Just tell him to leave at dawn.</i>

980
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,490
I think Ms. Pi finds your room suspicious.

981
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:48,536
If you're lying about even
the smallest thing, you will pay for it.

982
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,955
<i>We can never let Bun-ok get wind of it.</i>

983
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,000
<i>If the information is useful,
you get 50 million won.</i>

984
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,336
<i>That bastard is Taedong River 1.
I'm sure of it.</i>

985
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,922
<i>If he's in here,
he's like a rat in a trap.</i>

986
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,841
<i>Where can we hide him
in this girls' dormitory?</i>

987
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,344
We'll be arrested too.

988
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:08,890
<i>It's D-day. We must capture him.</i>

989
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:21,903

01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,426

<i>Snow full of love falls down</i>

992
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,726
<i>If there's a song about our love</i>

993
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,021
<i>Our lives will become beautiful</i>

994
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,775
<i>Sorrowful dreams in this world</i>

995
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,821
<i>Rain full of loneliness pours down</i>

996
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:09,450
<i>If you love with all your compassion</i>

997
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:13,079
<i>There'll be only the truth and faith left</i>

998
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:17,041
<i>If I'm a silent wanderer</i>

999
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,045
<i>I'll become a rock in this world</i>

1000
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,300
<i>-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love</i>

1001
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,594
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1002
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:31,514
-One more time!
<i>-If I'm a silent</i>

1003
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,099
<i>-wanderer
-Wanderer</i>

1004
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,853
<i>-I'll become a rock in this world
-I'll become a rock in this world</i>

1005
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:41,482
<i>-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love</i>

1006
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,278
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1007
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:50,825
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1008
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:56,039
This song's great.
