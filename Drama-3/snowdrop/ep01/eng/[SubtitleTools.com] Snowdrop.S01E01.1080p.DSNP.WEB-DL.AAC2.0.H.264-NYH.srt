SPRING 1987

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,617
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:42,558
Could you put this in your bag?

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,980
Hey, check this out. Look.

6
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,610
<i>-We keep missing each other
-We keep missing each other</i>

7
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:55,321
<i>-With time passing by
-With time passing by</i>

8
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:59,742
<i>For the long time
there’s a weathered grave wood</i>

9
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:04,705
<i>The rain and winds erased
the name on the wood</i>

10
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,881
Room 207.

11
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,927
<i>Room 207.</i>

12
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,220
Get out of my way.

13
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,763
Eun Yeong-ro.

14
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:21,806
<i>There's a call for you.</i>

15
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,358
Me? A call for me?

16
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,534
-That hurt!
-I'm sorry.

17
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,370
Hey, move out of the way!

18
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,334
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

19
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,848
Get out of my way.

20
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:08,311
Five, four, three, two,

21
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:09,478
-Wait!
-one.

22
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,980
Wait. No!

23
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,485
You know you have to
take it in 30 seconds.

24
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,655
-I do.
-Should I make an exception?

25
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,492
Should I?

26
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:24,911
I shouldn't.

27
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,464
This is the Hosu Women's University dorm.

28
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:38,925
A student in room 205?

29
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,720
Yes. You're calling for Lee Yeon-suk?

30
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,388
Okay.

31
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,400
Hello?

32
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,577
Hey, who was it? It was him, wasn't it?

33
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:09,747
The engineering major
you met the other day, right?

34
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,041
I told you,
that long-haired guy and I are done.

35
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,168
He didn't even call me after that day.

36
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,713
Then who was it? It was
your first time getting a phone call.

37
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,802
It was my grandma
asking what time I'd be taking the bus.

38
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,220
I really thought it was him.

39
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:28,766
You know, phone calls are
usually for Hye-ryeong.

40
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:29,892
It was fun to watch.

41
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,311
Did you see that?
She thought it was for her.

42
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,272
"Get out of my way."

43
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,567
What?

44
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,862
Hey, I told you. It was my grandma.

45
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,740
Your grandma…

46
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:49,328
Yes. It was my grandma.

47
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,167
I wonder how she managed to get through.

48
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:59,088
I heard you barely get through
even though you call for two hours on end.

49
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,516
A dormitory with 360 students,

50
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,436
and only two phones. How ridiculous.

51
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:18,149
The upside of it, though,
is that we get to improve our running.

52
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:21,277
I doubt that.
Two days ago, I ran as fast as I could

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,196
only to see Bun-ok
hang up the call in front of me.

54
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,157
Saying 30 seconds was over.

55
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:29,410
I guess Gizzard treats us differently.

56
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,620
She doesn't dare hang up calls for me.

57
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,456
The call was for you.

58
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,042
You weren't in the room,
so I went there to…

59
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,084
Just eat.

60
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:39,337
What?

61
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,922
She hung up a call for me?

62
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,717
Darn it. Who does
that Gizzard think she is?

63
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,511
Stop calling her Gizzard.
Watch what you say.

64
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:48,763
She has a name.

65
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,809
There you go again, pretending to be nice.

66
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:57,438
What did you say?

67
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:00,900
Gye Bun-ok means chicken, poop, and house.

68
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,276
In one word, it's "gizzard."

69
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:07,990
Her name actually means "fragrant bead."

70
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:09,867
Okay, Hye-ja?

71
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,663
Hey!

72
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,208
You wench.

73
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,961
I told you, my name is Ko Hye-ryeong!

74
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,048
I told you numerous times
that I changed my name.

75
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,259
How will you oust the dictator?

76
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,137
My goodness, don't make me laugh.

77
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,431
Look. Why don't you come to your senses

78
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:34,725
and fight for your fellow students
in our dorm?

79
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,395
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

80
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,823
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIALISM

81
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,664
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

82
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,165
Yeong-ro.

83
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:03,003
"You will never defeat us. Not even once."

84
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,464
"God won't allow it,

85
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,591
and neither will Eom-ji."

86
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:14,557
I must say, this comic book isn't
about baseball but about romance.

87
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:27,236
THE TERRIFYING MERCENARY BASEBALL TEAM

88
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,370
<i>He sure is shameless.</i>

89
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,746
Really shameless.

90
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:40,207
He'll attend this year too?

91
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,544
Okay. Keep a close eye on him.

92
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,838
Were you talking about Eun?

93
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:49,925
He didn't even take part in the revolution

94
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,802
but wants to be a member of the Society?

95
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:54,680
That's just absurd.

96
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,725
SECRETARY-GENERAL OF AEMIN PARTY
NAM TAE-IL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 2

97
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,935
You wicked little fox.

98
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,521
You sure know exactly how I feel.

99
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,482
You're going to be late.

100
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:07,318
-You should get there before Code 1 does.
-Yes, I should.

101
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,945
Eun Chang-su is definitely a liability.

102
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,780
How could he not see that?

103
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:13,908
It's so frustrating.

104
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,462
DIRECTOR OF ANSP
EUN CHANG-SU, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 3

105
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,839
<i>I know he's your predecessor as director,</i>

106
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,217
but he's four years your junior.

107
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,638
We can't let people think
that you bow to Nam Tae-il, can we?

108
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,516
At today's gathering,

109
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,435
you should show him who's boss.

110
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,231
Okay, honey?

111
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,207
Present arms.

112
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,708
-Salute!
-Salute!

113
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:30,526
Attention. Present arms.

114
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:32,111
-Salute!
-Salute!

115
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,205
Sir.

116
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:45,416
You came early.

117
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,625
Hello.

118
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,085
It's good to see you.

119
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,420
-How have you been?
-Good.

120
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:52,339
-All right. Let's have a seat.
-Sure, let's.

121
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,426
HEAD OF AEMIN PARTY
PARK MU-YEOL, THE RULING PARTY NUMBER 1

122
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,970
DONGSIM SOCIETY

123
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:10,065
My goodness. It's been a while, everyone.

124
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:27,416
Look at this bastard…

125
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,876
The president is coming.

126
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,429
Attention!

127
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:45,142
Present arms!

128
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:50,814
Order arms!

129
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,369
All right. Let us all have a glass first.

130
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:15,297
Sir! Let me give the toast today.

131
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,807
To the 30th anniversary
of Dongsim Society,

132
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,226
and to the president and our nation!

133
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,766
<i>How's Operation Phoenix going?</i>

134
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:52,311
Yes. We'll make it look like
the North abducts Professor Han I-seop,

135
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:53,854
the economic brains,

136
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:57,441
and the opposition party runs
for president with the North's funding.

137
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:00,152
If word is out that they're running
with the Communists' money,

138
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:03,322
the opposition party
will lose the election for sure.

139
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:06,825
It can't go awry.

140
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,077
It won't. It's going smoothly.

141
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,789
We're making sure that
a peaceful handover of power is possible.

142
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:12,998
Possible?

143
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,337
For you, the honorable leader,
and our Aemin Party,

144
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,965
I swear on my life
that our party will retake power!

145
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,515
You're indeed something else, Tae-il.

146
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,892
As the head of the campaign,

147
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:35,395
you should guide Director Eun well.

148
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,523
I will, sir.

149
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,076
Hello, ma'am. It's good to see you.

150
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:51,662
You're here too, ma'am.
Please come inside.

151
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,505
Oh, my.

152
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:05,259
How amazing!

153
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:09,429
I knew it. You were born elegant,

154
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:13,308
so you look like an elegant French woman.
You look perfect in it.

155
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:14,518
WIFE OF EUN CHANG-SU, HONG AE-RA

156
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,603
And what do you think, Mrs. Hong?

157
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,147
You look so beautiful.

158
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:24,069
A wife of an officer or a politician

159
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:28,156
should have her own fashion style.

160
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,701
Why do you think?

161
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,077
WIFE OF NAM TAE-IL, CHO SEONG-SIM

162
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,037
Well…

163
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:38,542
To become a fashion icon
and show everyone--

164
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,336
No, that's not it.

165
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,260
To win…

166
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,640
the hearts of the public.

167
00:14:56,184 --> 00:15:00,022
Because one's fashion,
especially a politician's wife's fashion,

168
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:04,026
is like a message to the people.

169
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,111
What does one's fashion mean?

170
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,571
-A message.
-A message.

171
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,169
Thank you.

172
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:24,713
Ma'am.

173
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,094
For your birthday party,

174
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:34,765
would you like to wear <i>hanbok</i> or a dress?

175
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,268
A dress. But I don't want it
to be too much.

176
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,187
Not too unique.

177
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,980
You know what I mean.

178
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:45,442
I do. Like something
the First Lady would wear.

179
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:48,695
As you wish, ma'am.

180
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:54,785
You're so thoughtful, ma'am.

181
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:02,417
I wish you could be
as thoughtful, Mrs. Hong.

182
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,587
But then, she used to be an actress.

183
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,554
Yes, ranks are what matter
in the military,

184
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:16,682
but you know it's different in politics.

185
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,977
Code 1's faith in you
determines your power and rank.

186
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:25,732
And Mr. Eun seems
to keep forgetting that simple truth.

187
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,737
Perhaps you could help him remember that.

188
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,203
He can be quite straightforward.

189
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,998
I guess he's made
a mistake to your husband.

190
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:46,795
Please tell Mr. Nam that we're so sorry.

191
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,716
You know I'm always on your side.

192
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:56,680
Anyway, you're
three years older than me, right?

193
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:01,143
As far as I know, she's four years older.

194
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,519
Right?

195
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:04,730
Oh, my.

196
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:07,607
You're four years older than me?

197
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:13,822
Well, our ages don't matter.
Our husbands' ranks do.

198
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:23,915
My, Mrs. Hong.
You look much younger than your age.

199
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,753
Charlotte, I'd like to pay for the dress.

200
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,090
Sorry.

201
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:43,018
My goodness, ma'am.
You know you don't have to pay.

202
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,770
Ms. Kim, here.

203
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:47,314
I'm just honored to make a dress for you.

204
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,319
How dare that little wench…

205
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,745
WELCOME BACK, MR. LEE GANG-MU

206
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:10,128
Mr. Lee Gang-mu?

207
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,723
It's an honor, Mr. Lee.

208
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,894
To pick you up, the legendary Black Tiger.

209
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,029
COSMOS TOYS

210
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,632
CHIEF AN GYEONG-HUI

211
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:22,617
APPRECIATION AWARD
PRESENTED TO AN GYEONG-HUI

212
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,453
ANSP

213
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,509
Here, ma'am. The photo's come out.

214
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:41,094
Good.

215
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,024
INFORMATION

216
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,696
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

217
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:26,139
And the evidence?

218
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,391
In Hyeseong Hotel--

219
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,354
Who'd dare bug the chief's office?

220
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,403
Didn't you read
the opposition party's interviews?

221
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,405
Apparently, their moles
are all over this place.

222
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,450
They're even confident
of getting hold of top secret documents.

223
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,619
You must know the man's the Crown Prince.

224
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:48,703
And the women…

225
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,791
I'll take care of this case.

226
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,668
So get your hands off it.

227
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:59,547
Listen. How about dinner tonight?
It's been a while.

228
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:01,216
With other alumni.

229
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,637
Black Tiger's back.

230
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,641
Lee Gang-mu. You know him well, right?

231
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:13,603
That brat. He sure is a workaholic.

232
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:15,730
He wants to brief me right away.

233
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,711
<i>From the look of things,</i>

234
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:39,462
<i>he's been winning them over</i>

235
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:43,633
<i>while moving from one lab to another
and using different identities.</i>

236
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:48,221
He murders Koreans who try
to escape while being moved to the North

237
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,974
without even caring about
the German intelligence agencies.

238
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:53,435
Brutally in cold blood.

239
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:57,063
And while chasing him,

240
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:59,733
one of our agents…

241
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,613
GERMANY
2 YEARS AGO

242
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,785
Let go of me!

243
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:22,464
Hello, sir.

244
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,398
-No!
-Leave us alone!

245
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:45,904
The next cabin!

246
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,034
Move aside, Jin-seong.

247
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:07,759
PRIVATE PROPERTY

248
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:12,764
Jin-seong.

249
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:15,642
Jin-seong!

250
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:17,519
Jin-seong.

251
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:19,521
No, Jin-seong…

252
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:25,985
Jin-seong!

253
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:27,862
His face,

254
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:31,366
name, and age are all unknown.

255
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:34,744
Next.

256
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,746
This is his code name.

257
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,125
And we got intel that he snuck into Seoul.

258
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,336
Then you came back to Korea
to catch Taedong River 1?

259
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:53,930
He's been acting secretly
all over Germany,

260
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,558
and now he's in Seoul.

261
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,819
He either has to win someone over in Seoul

262
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:11,239
or he was given a mission
the agents here can't pull off.

263
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:13,032
In any case,

264
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,828
we must get him
before he accomplishes his mission.

265
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:20,165
It's much more urgent
than catching small-fry spies.

266
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:21,708
All right.

267
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,585
Any volunteers?

268
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,504
Who wants to work with Gang-mu?

269
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:27,547
Me.

270
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:30,550
-I want to do it.
-Oh Dong-jae. And?

271
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,677
-I want in.
-So do I.

272
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:34,804
-Any more?
-I want in.

273
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:37,515
-I want in.
-So do I.

274
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:44,022
-What the hell?
-What?

275
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:46,274
-What is it?
-What's going on?

276
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,026
What's going on?

277
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,081
Is that what I should do to him?

278
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:04,459
TAEDONG RIVER 1

279
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:10,590
God, that nutcase.

280
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,343
Put your guns down.

281
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,804
I said, put your guns away!

282
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:19,766
Well…

283
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:23,102
Sorry about that. You must be startled.

284
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,104
She's our very first female agent.

285
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,898
She's obviously not trained properly.

286
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:31,277
Well, she may be hot-tempered,
but she's really good at her job.

287
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,946
Her nickname's One Hundred Warriors.

288
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,948
-Right?
-I don't need her.

289
00:25:35,782 --> 00:25:37,283
I only need disciplined ones.

290
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,925
You little…

291
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,510
Have you gone mad?

292
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:04,727
Oh, my. He's so handsome
that I can never get sick of him.

293
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,939
Oh, my. He's killing me.

294
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:10,525
You should grill it nice and crisp.

295
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,027
Careful. You're going to burn it.

296
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:15,613
God, you and your nagging. You do it then.

297
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,658
I'm not nagging. I'm just teaching you.

298
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:22,453
I bet you only ate sausages in Germany.
What do you know about pork belly?

299
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:23,454
Germany?

300
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,582
What? Then he's a Korean-German?

301
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:30,044
Didn't you know? He's a graduate student
of economics at Berlin University.

302
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,797
Oh, my goodness. For real?

303
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,966
I heard he came to write a thesis

304
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:36,801
on Park Chung-hee's
Economic Development Plan.

305
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:37,927
Really?

306
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,596
-He's so cool!
-That's amazing.

307
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,973
These lettuce leaves are really…

308
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:46,561
Come on, Gwang-tae.
You should grill the meat.

309
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:49,105
Why do you make Soo-ho do all the work?

310
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,566
He didn't pass the exam. I did.

311
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,652
I, Oh Gwang-tae,
am the star of the day, aren't I?

312
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,029
Look at this guy.

313
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:59,365
You only passed the first round.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

314
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:01,200
Oh, my goodness.

315
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:04,537
-Hey.
-Our stingy Ms. Bong may say mean words,

316
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,872
but she cares a lot for me.

317
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,749
Look how she threw
this barbecue party for me.

318
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,586
You're three months behind on rent.

319
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:14,422
Why would I throw
a barbecue party for you?

320
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:18,301
You should learn from him, you brat.

321
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:21,012
Soo-ho paid for all this
to congratulate you.

322
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:22,388
-What?
-What?

323
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:24,599
-Let me do it.
-What?

324
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:26,934
-You're the best.
-What are you doing?

325
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:29,187
-Pour him a drink.
-Sure.

326
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,689
-But you said you're the star of the day.
-No, you are.

327
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:34,609
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
100TH ANNIVERSARY

328
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,115
15 MINUTES BEFORE DORM ROLL CALL

329
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,033
Sorry!

330
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:46,954
-No!
-Run!

331
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,208
Run!

332
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,211
What is it that you want to say?

333
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:00,885
You know what that means.

334
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:02,470
Hye-ryeong!

335
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,697
This is my heart.

336
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:23,324
What's going on?

337
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,327
My heart is burning
like the sun for you, Hye-ryeong.

338
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,871
Please accept it.

339
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:32,250
Hye-ryeong!

340
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,169
Ten minutes…

341
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,087
What?

342
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:39,674
We only have ten minutes.

343
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:41,509
Hye-ryeong.

344
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:44,595
Hye-ryeong!

345
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:53,312
Wait for me!

00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,001
INDEPENDENT HOSU, ONE HOSU, UNITED HOSU

347
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,506

348
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,591
No!

349
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:51,287
-Hye-ryeong. Hurry!
-Darn it.

350
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,580
Damn it!

351
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:55,625
Hye-ryeong. Hurry!

352
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,252
-Hurry!
-Darn it.

353
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,088
Good. Run!

354
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,133
Run!

355
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:08,012

356
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,811
-What?
-Just leave it. Hurry.

357
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:19,023
But it's from Grandma.

358
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,234
Darn it.

359
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:33,246
Hey! Move!

360
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:41,462
Jeong-min.

361
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,130
Five minutes left.

362
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:52,223
Yeong-ro and Hye-ryeong haven't come back.

363
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:53,850
What? Both of them?

364
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:55,935
Be careful.

365
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:57,645
-Careful.
-Hello.

366
00:30:57,728 --> 00:31:00,314
-Hello.
-Be careful. You might hurt yourself.

367
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,401
My goodness.

368
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,196
KEEP IT BRIEF

369
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:10,491
Damn it.

370
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:15,079
Why isn't she here yet?

371
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,291
This is bad.

372
00:31:58,372 --> 00:31:59,206
Hye-ryeong!

373
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,543
Gosh.

374
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:04,128
What about Yeong-ro?

375
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:08,883
Yeong-ro!

376
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:15,473
My, what happened to her?
It's already nine.

377
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:16,724
Mr. Kim.

378
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:20,186
-What are you doing here?
-What?

379
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,272
Oh, Yeong-ro's not back yet.

380
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,650
-Yeong-ro?
-Yes.

381
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,908
-Oh, no. If the hall director sees her…
-Come on. Hurry!

382
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,957
-Sure. I should close the door.
-Hurry.

383
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:43,834
-Okay.
-This is why I hate working with him.

384
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:52,009
Hello, ma'am.

385
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:00,810
Wait.

386
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:06,440
Ma'am. About what happened yesterday…

387
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,069
The hall director is over there.

388
00:33:10,152 --> 00:33:11,320
Hide.

389
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:13,823
Hide.

390
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:17,326
All right, then. I'll do it accordingly.

391
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:22,832
No.

392
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:28,754
Make sure to close it exactly on the hour.

393
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,506
I will, ma'am.

394
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:33,968
It shouldn't be
even a second later than that.

395
00:33:36,554 --> 00:33:37,388
Sure, ma'am.

396
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:39,056
DORM MAIN DOOR

397
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,183
Have you fixed the chairs in the sauna?

398
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:43,853
I'm going to.

399
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:48,190
There are so many things
the students ask me to fix, so…

400
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,361
I'll get it done soon.

401
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,202
My goodness.

402
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:01,996
What do we do?

403
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,622
Just follow her for now.

404
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:04,874
Darn it.

405
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,631
Yeong-ro.

406
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,968
Yeong-ro? Where did she go?

407
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,721
What's that?

408
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,150
My goodness.

409
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:44,538
How could you leave her behind?

410
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:46,248
I missed roll call twice already.

411
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:47,625
What could I do?

412
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,296
So did she pass the dorm main gate or not?

413
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,423
I don't know!
I just ran without looking back.

414
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,175
-Ko Hye-ryeong!
-What?

415
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,510
Now…

416
00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:02,264
we're all going to get kicked out,
aren't we?

417
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,975
Stop whining and get ready for roll call.

418
00:35:06,143 --> 00:35:07,144
Okay.

419
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:31,794
Say good night.

420
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:33,754
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

421
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:49,728
Say good night.

422
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:52,022
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

423
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,039
I'm sorry, ma'am.

424
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,994
Hurry and get inside.

425
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,168
CHOCO BALLS

426
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:57,171
Say good night.

427
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:59,465
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

428
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:39,672
Say good night.

429
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,548
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

430
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,179
Go! Go now!

431
00:37:58,023 --> 00:37:59,233
What?

432
00:37:59,817 --> 00:38:00,693
Hurry!

433
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:07,449
This is why I told her to leave it.

434
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,201
Why did she have to go to pick it up?

435
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:10,661
-I can't believe her.
-Hye-ryeong.

436
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:14,873
It may not be a problem for a rich girl
like you, but if we're kicked out--

437
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:18,335
Yeong-ro might not be able
to afford to rent a room.

438
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,586
What do you know?

439
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,631
She gave out rice cakes
to everyone on the day she moved in.

440
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:24,717
Her family runs a rice cake store!
She relies on scholarships.

441
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,844
She answers phone calls with Bun-ok.

442
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:36,353
Guys.

443
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:37,855
Open it.

444
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:39,982
-My goodness.
-Open the window.

445
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:42,693
-Say good night.
-Good night, ma'am.

446
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:45,863
Darn it.

447
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:56,081
-What…
-Rat.

448
00:38:56,707 --> 00:38:58,876
I just saw a rat!

449
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,170
-Rat!
-Where?

450
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:03,589
No. This way!

451
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:05,299
Get her pajamas.

452
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:10,512
Where?

453
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:12,681
-Where?
-This way!

454
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:13,932
That way!

455
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:17,227
There's a rat! Grab a broom!

456
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:21,482
Yeong-ro, give me your bag.

457
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,577
Lift your foot.

458
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:37,956
Thank you.

459
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,878
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,258
Well…

461
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,930
-Go.
-Let's get back.

462
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,932
-Move.
-I hate rats!

463
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:58,352
Yeong-ro, hurry.

464
00:39:58,477 --> 00:39:59,686
I'm almost done.

465
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:10,656
Well, I could've sworn
that I saw a rat there.

466
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,033
I definitely saw one going in there.

467
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:16,328
Don't you know the dorm rules?

468
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,163
How dare you scream like that?

469
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,124
I'm sorry, ma'am.

470
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:25,295
You said you saw it,
so make sure to catch it.

471
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:34,138
By myself?

472
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,326
Eun Yeong-ro.

473
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:58,287
Yes, ma'am?

474
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,832
Why are you sweating so much?

475
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:07,880
Well, I ran really hard
to not be late for roll call.

476
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:10,424
So why did you have to stay out late?

477
00:41:11,008 --> 00:41:13,594
What if your roommates
get kicked out because of you?

478
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,307
I'm sorry. I won't stay out late again.

479
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,269
Room 207.

480
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:25,564
Recite the dorm rules.

481
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,399
-Abide by the curfew.
-Abide by the curfew.

482
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:29,193
-No protest. No sleeping out.
-No protest. No sleeping out.

483
00:41:29,276 --> 00:41:30,652
Again.

484
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:32,779
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.
-Abide by the curfew. No protest.

485
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:34,948
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.
-No sleeping out. No cooking food.

486
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:36,366
You know…

487
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:40,537
your room only has one chance left, right?

488
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:41,747
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

489
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:43,457
That'll be all.

490
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,709
Say good night.

491
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:48,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

492
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:04,102
How did you think of climbing the wall?

493
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:05,187
Don't get me started.

494
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:11,109
Wait. I forgot the rice cakes.

495
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,537
I wonder Yeong-ro managed to get in.

496
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:24,206
What?

497
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,124
Mr. Kim.

498
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,125
Look who's here.

499
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,255
So you didn't get caught, Yeong-ro.

500
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:33,966
That's great!

501
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:39,179
You were right. He brought it in.

502
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:41,014
I told you he would.

503
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:43,100
He can fix or unlock anything.

504
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:44,643
Of course.

505
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:48,438
I may be old,
but I'm a jack of all trades.

506
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:52,943
I bet you're hungry.

507
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:56,196
Ta-da. They're oat rice cakes.

508
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,323
They're supposed to be good for diabetes.

509
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,076
Oh, my. I'm so grateful.

510
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:01,994
Hey!

511
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:04,413
We should go back to our room.

512
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:05,956
Sure, you should.

513
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,125
Oh, right. Hold on.

514
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:12,546
Can you give this to Bun-ok on the way?

515
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,799
Tell her I'll smash it
if she asks me to fix it again.

516
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,384
It's such a nuisance.

517
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:18,719
I will.

518
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:21,513
-Good night.
-Good night.

519
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:24,891
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

520
00:43:27,352 --> 00:43:29,229
Right. Hold it for me for a second.

521
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:38,238
Bun-ok, it's been fixed.

522
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,282
I almost forgot about it.

523
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,994
And this is the honey rice cake you love.

524
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:46,830
Oh, right.
It was your grandma's birthday, right?

525
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:48,123
Thank you.

526
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:50,459
Wait. Bun-ok…

527
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:55,005
Thank you so much for earlier.

528
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:57,841
The hall director told me to catch a rat.

529
00:43:57,924 --> 00:44:00,052
By myself, since I'm the one who saw it.

530
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:02,679
-Really?
-What a wench.

531
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:04,473
I hope she goes somewhere and drops--

532
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:08,185
Yes, really.

533
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:10,729
I'm so sorry, Bun-ok.

534
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,856
Well, I'll have to put on a show again.

535
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:16,068
I'll beg her saying
I must've seen wrong or cry my heart out.

536
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:26,536
If you're that sorry,
would you do me a favor?

537
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,499
What is it?
Just name it. I'll do anything.

538
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:38,965
Get me the English edition
of <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

539
00:44:39,716 --> 00:44:41,718
English edition?

540
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,140
What? Is that so surprising?

541
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:50,102
Because I want an English edition
when I'm not even a college student?

542
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:53,438
No. That's not what I was thinking.

543
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:55,899
Even English literature majors
don't read them much.

544
00:44:55,982 --> 00:45:00,654
You know how it is.
They're not even that good at English.

545
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:09,121
I'll give you a copy tomorrow.
I recently bought one.

546
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:11,581
See you tomorrow then.

547
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,794
Right.

548
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:19,339
Let's go.

549
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:30,225
What do you think is in that room?

550
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,145
What are you talking about?

551
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:35,731
Come on. Something's really fishy.

552
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:41,111
She opened the door just a crack
in case you looked inside.

553
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,243
Stop talking nonsense and give that to me.

554
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:49,327
Let's run.

555
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:51,621
Hey!

556
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:57,836
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

557
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,264
COSMOS TOYS

558
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:52,349
<i>This man</i>

559
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:55,352
is likely to have helped
Taedong River 1 with his mission.

560
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:57,771
And there's no record
that he came into Korea, so…

561
00:47:01,191 --> 00:47:02,234
Damn it.

562
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:09,324
-Why didn't you tell me about this?
-I'm sure I said that I don't need you.

563
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:13,078
Who's this guy?

564
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,625
Is he someone connected
to Taedong River 1?

565
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:23,171
I'll handle Professor Han I-seop.

566
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,592
He's the brains of Choi Dae-yeong,
the leader of the opposition party.

567
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:30,679
I met him a few times
while monitoring him.

568
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:34,683
Are you going to keep a close eye
on him when he knows your face?

569
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:39,479
Oh, that?

570
00:47:40,897 --> 00:47:43,233
He thinks I'm a journalist who was fired.

571
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:48,738
Who was fired
for strongly condemning the ruling party.

572
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:56,997
I can infiltrate deep into their party.

573
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:06,631
This is amazing.
It's the guy I met with you guys!

574
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:08,300
That's amazing!

575
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:09,384
Hurry!

576
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:12,262
-Really?
-Oh, my God!

577
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:13,555
Let's go open it.

578
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:27,777
TO YEONG-U

579
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,321
How could he…

580
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,073
He doesn't take a leave or write me back.

581
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:38,038
HOW COULD YOU

582
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:51,885
I swear I'll…

583
00:48:59,142 --> 00:49:01,478
You're so mean, Yeong-u.

584
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:16,242
Come on. Guys in the military
never write back to their sisters.

585
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:17,577
Only to their girlfriends.

586
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:19,371
TIMESHEET

587
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:22,290
But he doesn't have a girlfriend.

588
00:49:22,374 --> 00:49:24,626
He only thinks about me,

589
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:26,878
so my grandma's so worried about him.

590
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,005
He's in the military.
I'm sure he's doing well.

591
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:32,926
But he's not just in the…

592
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:38,598
Bun-ok.

593
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:50,986
Thanks.

594
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:52,404
Hello?

595
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:54,406
How do I look?

596
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,409
-Pardon?
-Do I look cool?

597
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,249
People will think I'm
a college girl, right?

598
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:12,257
No, it's okay.

599
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,093
Hey, keep it short, will you?
The phone's not yours.

600
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:19,222
Babe, I'm afraid I've got to go.

601
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:20,932
What? Yes.

602
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:24,936
Then see you at Harmony at six.

603
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,187
Okay, babe.

604
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:31,568
What the…

605
00:50:42,495 --> 00:50:45,165
ASPIRING TO BECOME A WORLD-FAMOUS
OPERA SINGER, KO HYE-RYEONG

606
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,343
This is Hosu Women's University Dormitory.

607
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:02,015
I heard Ms. Ko Hye-ryeong,

608
00:51:02,098 --> 00:51:05,894
a senior in Voice and Music major,
Hosu's Prima Donna who will

609
00:51:05,977 --> 00:51:09,522
become a world-famous opera singer,
stays in Room 207.

610
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:11,232
Is that true?

611
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,151
Yes, it is.

612
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,787
This is Oh Gwang-tae who stays
in Room 207 at Haedal Boarding House,

613
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:28,708
whose residents have passed
the most difficult national exams.

614
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,961
More than those of any other houses.

615
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:34,881
And?

616
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:40,136
Could I speak to any lady of Room 207?

617
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:43,056
I'm afraid no one
in that room is here right now.

618
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,600
If you leave a message to me,
I'll make sure they get it.

619
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:52,690
A group blind date?

620
00:51:55,568 --> 00:51:56,736
A group blind date?

621
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:59,405
Hold on. Yes, go on.

622
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:02,367
This Saturday.

623
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,494
At three o'clock. Hold on.

624
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:06,746
At Rome Coffee Shop
in front of Hosu Women's University?

625
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,790
Wait a second.

626
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:12,752
The girls of Room 207 might turn it down.
You can't just tell them to come.

627
00:52:12,836 --> 00:52:15,839
We will wait there until they come.

628
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:17,841
Please tell them that.

629
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:20,802
Oh, and four girls live
in the room, right?

630
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,013
-Yes.
-Good. Thank you.

631
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:27,225
HAEDAL BOARDING HOUSE

632
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,769
-You did it!
-This is great!

633
00:52:29,853 --> 00:52:31,020
I love you!

634
00:52:33,356 --> 00:52:36,151
We're going on
a group blind date thanks to Hye-ryeong.

635
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,236
She's indeed
the most popular girl in the school.

636
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:41,364
But I don't think Jeong-min will go.

637
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:45,493
Then you're one girl short.

638
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:50,290
This is a women's university.
I'm sure we'll find one.

639
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:52,208
How about me?

640
00:52:53,585 --> 00:52:54,919
I live in the dorm too.

641
00:52:57,338 --> 00:52:58,423
Pardon?

642
00:52:58,506 --> 00:53:01,926
Wait, Gwang-tae. Four girls are coming,

643
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:03,303
but we're three.

644
00:53:07,557 --> 00:53:08,683
Soo-ho!

645
00:53:12,604 --> 00:53:14,689
Do you have time this Saturday?
No, you must.

646
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:17,984
Why are you always like that?
What is it this time?

647
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:22,280
Soo-ho, you know that I never got to date
because I was too busy studying.

648
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:24,407
If it's about
a group blind date again, forget it.

649
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:28,995
But it's Hosu.

650
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:30,246
Go away.

651
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,540
Hosu's Maria Callas is coming.

652
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,626
Go away! Now!

653
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:36,544
Fine.

654
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:39,422
Then I won't set you up
with Professor Han.

655
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:43,885
You have a lot of questions for him.
Say goodbye to your thesis.

656
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,935
So they're from Hosu Women's University?

657
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,189
Just one day…

658
00:53:56,272 --> 00:53:57,982
I don't wish for more.

659
00:53:58,066 --> 00:54:02,237
I just want to live
as a college girl for one day.

660
00:54:07,283 --> 00:54:09,077
I guess that's too much to ask for.

661
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,546
It's too much, isn't it?

662
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:24,300
It's not.

663
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:28,972
Then will you convince Hye-ryeong for me?

664
00:54:30,556 --> 00:54:31,516
Okay.

665
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:33,977
<i>She's ridiculous.</i>

666
00:54:35,561 --> 00:54:36,688
She wants to join us?

667
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:39,023
Does she have no self-respect?

668
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:42,110
She wants to pretend
to be a college girl that badly?

669
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,198
I can understand her.

670
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:50,410
When you hear guys asking girls out
over the phone often enough,

671
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:53,454
you become envious
and want to go on a date too.

672
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:55,373
Don't you think?

673
00:54:56,582 --> 00:54:57,917
But not this time.

674
00:54:58,001 --> 00:54:59,836
That's deceiving the guys.

675
00:55:01,212 --> 00:55:02,213
You're right!

676
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,215
I totally agree with you.

677
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:09,846
But we avoided a disaster
during roll call thanks to Bun-ok.

678
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,599
Well, that is true, but…

679
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:15,810
But we shouldn't lie to the guys.

680
00:55:16,853 --> 00:55:19,397
God, I can never like you.

681
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,524
How hard is it to join us for once?

682
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:24,485
You guys go have a lot of fun.

683
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:27,905
Do you think I'm going because I want to?

684
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:30,575
I just want to make fun memories
for the freshmen.

685
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,541
Ms. Ko.

686
00:55:42,086 --> 00:55:43,546
I prepared it for you.

687
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:50,178
Wait. Hye-ryeong, wait.

688
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:56,434
As you said, it's really wrong
to lie to the guys.

689
00:55:56,517 --> 00:56:00,730
It may be nothing special for us,
but it is her dream.

690
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:04,817
Just this once. Please?

691
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:09,739
No.

692
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:12,867
What if…

693
00:56:13,618 --> 00:56:15,787
Well, I doubt she'll go that far…

694
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,041
but what if she won't take
any calls for you?

695
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:29,926
Go tell her I'll allow it just this once.

696
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:31,677
Make it clear.

697
00:56:33,596 --> 00:56:34,889
Thank you, Hye-ryeong.

698
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,271
Fun memories?

699
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:46,442
Are you sure it's not because of
the guy who passed the national exam?

700
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:50,905
What's so wrong about that?

701
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:53,241
It's a human instinct to try to find

702
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:56,035
as good a life partner as possible.

703
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:02,291
<i>"The guy who passed the national exam"?</i>

704
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,589
It's a human instinct. It's very natural.

705
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:11,676
Oh, my God! We're really doing this!

706
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,762
By a good partner, you mean
a woman with a good background, right?

707
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:16,514
Of course.

708
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,101
Only lowlifes marry for love.

709
00:57:20,184 --> 00:57:24,939
The ruling class only marries for money.
That's what Engels said.

710
00:57:25,022 --> 00:57:27,275
So using the fact
that you passed the first round,

711
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,069
you're trying to court Hye-ryeong
who you're sure is bourgeois?

712
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:33,573
You pathetic punk.

713
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:35,450
You have to keep your word. I mean…

714
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:38,411
you can't choose Hye-ryeong.

715
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,039
I'm sure she'll choose me,
but just in case.

716
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:45,668
Fine, I won't. But you have to set me up
with Professor Han properly, okay?

717
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:47,628
Of course, I will.

718
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:55,761
What are you going to use as your item?

719
00:57:55,845 --> 00:57:57,805
What? What item?

720
00:57:58,723 --> 00:58:01,434
God, I can't believe you.

721
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:05,188
What's the point
of going to Berlin University?

722
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:06,189
Let me see.

723
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:07,773
What are you looking for?

724
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:09,442
What are you doing?

725
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:10,985
Later…

726
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:12,612
This is a designer wallet.

727
00:58:12,695 --> 00:58:14,697
-What are you doing?
-I mean…

728
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:17,492
don't take out
something like this luxury pen.

729
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:22,205
What? This is perfect.

730
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:26,250
Soo-ho, this is just perfect. Use it.

731
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:28,920
A meeting with Professor Han.

732
00:58:29,003 --> 00:58:30,671
Yes. I already told you.

733
00:58:32,173 --> 00:58:33,466
This is really happening!

734
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:38,262
Hye-ryeong, it's ten to three.

735
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:39,764
I know.

736
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:43,017
Bun-ok said she'd be
at Rome Coffee Shop by three.

737
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,770
She must've stopped by some salon, right?

738
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,523
It's just putting pearls on a pig, though.

739
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:53,736
Should I help with this--

740
00:58:57,865 --> 00:59:00,910
They just told us to be there
by three without asking us.

741
00:59:00,993 --> 00:59:03,454
So why do we have to be there
by the time they set?

742
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:07,166
Romantic relationships begin
with a tug-of-war.

743
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,752
And the best way to win is

744
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,629
to make the guy desperate.

745
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:13,172
Got it?

746
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:24,016
ROME COFFEE SHOP

747
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:29,105
ROME COFFEE SHOP

748
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,982
Darn it.

749
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:32,400
They're still not here.

750
00:59:35,486 --> 00:59:36,487
-It's them.
-Really?

751
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:38,322
-Hello.
-Hi.

752
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:39,407
Welcome.

753
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:42,201
This way, please.

754
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:46,205
-It's them.
-Really?

755
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:48,958
-Hello.
-Not again.

756
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:52,253
When will they come?

757
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,005
I don't know.

758
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:56,966
How could they be so late?

759
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:06,892
Oh Gwang-tae?

760
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:12,148
-No, I'm--
-Hye-ryeong!

761
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:43,429
What a shame.

762
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,477
It is. One more match,
and it would've been completed.

763
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:54,273
But…

764
01:00:55,024 --> 01:00:56,776
only the three of you came?

765
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:57,693
Three?

766
01:00:59,111 --> 01:01:02,073
Oh, she's not here yet?

767
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:04,784
She definitely promised to come by three.

768
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:08,329
I'm sorry. I guess
something urgent came up for her.

769
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:10,539
One of your guys
will have to do without a partner.

770
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,418
Yeong-ro!

771
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:20,257
Bun-ok.

772
01:01:25,012 --> 01:01:26,430
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,101
Hi.

774
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:35,815
I'm so sorry I'm late.

775
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:38,192
Sorry, guys.
Did you introduce yourselves yet?

776
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,611
We didn't, but--

777
01:01:42,863 --> 01:01:45,157
I'm a senior studying English Literature
at Hosu University.

778
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:46,909
My name is…

779
01:01:48,452 --> 01:01:49,787
Gye Seong.

780
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:03,926
Enjoy.

781
01:02:05,553 --> 01:02:08,180
All right. Now that all of us are here,

782
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,015
-please introduce yourselves.
-Wait.

783
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:13,352
How about we decide on our partners first?

784
01:02:15,813 --> 01:02:20,276
You see, I have two tickets
to a music concert.

785
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:21,652
If I'm to be there on time,

786
01:02:21,736 --> 01:02:23,904
I should get going soon.

787
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:28,659
And I was hoping
to go there with one of the guys here.

788
01:02:28,743 --> 01:02:30,411
Cutting to the chase. I love it.

789
01:02:30,494 --> 01:02:33,247
All right, then. How about you girls
pick among our items?

790
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,165
No.

791
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:37,710
Since she's in such a hurry,

792
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,254
we girls will take out our items.

793
01:02:40,337 --> 01:02:43,299
So that a guy who wants
to go with her can pick hers.

794
01:02:43,382 --> 01:02:46,135
Let's do that! I agree…

795
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:49,847
with Hye-ryeong.

796
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:53,976
Come on, Seol-hui.
Isn't that too boring and direct?

797
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:57,730
I'd rather leave it to fate.

798
01:02:57,813 --> 01:02:58,981
Right?

799
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:03,986
I also think
we should let fate decide for us.

800
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,531
I agree with you!
What's fun about it if it's so obvious?

801
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:10,409
Let's let fate decide for us.
All right, then.

802
01:03:10,826 --> 01:03:13,996
Could you girls please close your eyes?

803
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:15,581
And guys.

804
01:03:15,664 --> 01:03:16,540
-Yes?
-Yes?

805
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:18,459
Take out your items.

806
01:03:27,384 --> 01:03:28,886
EXAM PASS CERTIFICATE

807
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:31,430
Now open your eyes, please.

808
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,145
That's a paper airplane.

809
01:03:40,898 --> 01:03:43,818
What? This is perfect.

810
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,986
Use it.

811
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,161
Why don't you pick first, Hye-ryeong?

812
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:08,759
Oh, my. What exam is this certificate for?

813
01:04:10,636 --> 01:04:13,097
It's for the Civil Service Exam.

814
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:15,933
I passed the first round.

815
01:04:21,397 --> 01:04:23,274
-The first round?
-Yes, the first round.

816
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:26,026
Seol-hui.

817
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,737
Okay.

818
01:04:30,197 --> 01:04:32,074
-You pick first.
-What?

819
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:35,202
Me first?

820
01:05:28,547 --> 01:05:31,967
Come on, Yeong-ro.
Since I'm older, I should pick first.

821
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,409
EVERGREEN BOOKSTORE

822
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:30,401
She is really Yeong-ro.

823
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:33,278
I can't tell her.

824
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:51,797
LISTENING BOOTH

825
01:07:02,391 --> 01:07:03,684
She must be so embarrassed.

826
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:07,896
She's leaving.

827
01:07:36,258 --> 01:07:37,551
What about Bun-ok?

828
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:42,556
I mean, Seong. Where's Seong?

829
01:07:43,265 --> 01:07:45,768
Didn't you go
to the music concert with her?

830
01:07:48,687 --> 01:07:49,980
No, since I'm quite busy.

831
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,902
And you? Did you part ways already?

832
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:03,452
Yes, since I'm quite busy too.

833
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:16,131
-How much is it? Hurry!
-How much is what?

834
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:41,365
How much is it? Hurry!

835
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:42,574
It's 2,500 won.

836
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:03,762
I'm sorry. I'll buy it next time.

837
01:09:10,602 --> 01:09:12,062
Seriously?

838
01:09:15,941 --> 01:09:17,317
I can't believe this.

839
01:09:17,401 --> 01:09:18,402
Excuse me.

840
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,545
What's this?

841
01:09:37,546 --> 01:09:39,047
Didn't you come to buy this?

842
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:44,595
Why are you giving it to me?

843
01:09:46,972 --> 01:09:48,140
Because we met earlier.

844
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:52,186
Just take it.

845
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:55,272
But…

846
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,441
Wait.

847
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:02,070
Hey!

848
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:03,906
Hey!

849
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:15,125
What year did you start?

850
01:10:16,126 --> 01:10:17,461
Don't you dare lie.

851
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,046
Are you sure?

852
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:21,757
-Hey.
-You there!

853
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:28,430
I can't take it.

854
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:32,726
It wasn't like that.

855
01:10:32,809 --> 01:10:35,979
What? What are you doing?

856
01:10:36,063 --> 01:10:37,314
Just a minute, please.

857
01:10:57,084 --> 01:10:58,210
You jerk!

858
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:02,798
You went to the music concert with Seong.
You think I don't know that?

859
01:11:03,173 --> 01:11:05,092
Am I wrong? Tell me if I am!

860
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:07,094
-Tell me!
-I didn't.

861
01:11:07,177 --> 01:11:08,845
Tell me what happened then.

862
01:11:37,374 --> 01:11:38,417
Let's go.

863
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:57,185
The police are gone.

864
01:12:26,214 --> 01:12:27,090
Are you all right?

865
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:41,980
You could be an actress.

866
01:12:43,273 --> 01:12:44,858
Not a singer, though.

867
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,992
My big brother was
once arrested at a protest.

868
01:12:55,619 --> 01:12:56,620
So…

869
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:01,333
I see.

870
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:05,128
I should get going.

871
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,594
Wait. Just a minute.

872
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,353
Do you want

873
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:23,939
to have dinner…

874
01:13:41,206 --> 01:13:42,290
Thank you.

875
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:02,477
I hate to be indebted to other people.

876
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:09,025
So let me return the favor.
Meet me at Rome Coffee Shop tomorrow.

877
01:14:11,528 --> 01:14:14,030
At three. Okay?

878
01:14:17,117 --> 01:14:18,869
You have to come. Okay?

879
01:14:33,425 --> 01:14:35,177
<i>Clean the chair properly too, okay?</i>

880
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,845
Sure, sure.

881
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,681
And be careful
not to leave your footprints.

882
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:41,016
Got it.

883
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,976
Yeong-ro…

884
01:14:49,483 --> 01:14:50,859
Hey, don't run!

885
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:46,915
I wondered what it'd feel like

886
01:15:47,832 --> 01:15:49,668
to fall in love at first sight.

887
01:16:05,225 --> 01:16:07,435

<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

897
01:18:25,365 --> 01:18:28,368
He's recently been seen
quite often around Professor Han.

898
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:31,454
He's known as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University.

899
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:34,749
I've checked it with the university,
and there's no student…

900
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:37,502
by that name.

901
01:18:40,964 --> 01:18:43,341
NO REGISTRATION FOUND

902
01:18:43,425 --> 01:18:44,843

903
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:47,595
As of now, he's likely
to be Taedong River 1.

904
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,639
Keep a close eye on him at all times.

905
01:18:49,723 --> 01:18:50,724

Geum-cheol.

910
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:20,503
-Professor.
-Yes?

911
01:19:20,962 --> 01:19:23,631
-Are you going home now?
-Hey, Soo-ho. You're still here?

912
01:19:24,174 --> 01:19:27,594
Oh, my. This looks quite serious.

913
01:19:32,182 --> 01:19:35,477
It's nice of you to give me a ride.
Thank you.

914
01:19:38,563 --> 01:19:39,439
They're coming.

915
01:19:45,069 --> 01:19:47,238
The river's finally flowing. Over.

916
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:03,963
Comrade Joo.

917
01:20:04,631 --> 01:20:05,465
Comrade Joo.

918
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:07,300
Geum-cheol.

919
01:20:07,884 --> 01:20:08,885
Geum-cheol!

920
01:20:14,933 --> 01:20:15,934
Professor!

921
01:20:22,106 --> 01:20:23,858

922
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:26,778

01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:39,582
Lim Soo-ho.

924
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:43,127
Follow me.

931
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:12,240
Lim Soo-ho!

932
01:21:12,532 --> 01:21:14,409
-Fair election!
-Fair election!

933
01:21:14,576 --> 01:21:15,827
Stop!

934
01:21:16,202 --> 01:21:17,203
Lim Soo-ho!

935
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:28,214
-Fight.
-Fight.

936
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:30,758
-Fight.
-Fight.

937
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,555
FAIR ELECTION

938
01:21:40,894 --> 01:21:43,104
-Oh, my goodness.
-That's scary.

939
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,901
They're shooting so many tear bombs today.

940
01:21:50,028 --> 01:21:55,033
Aemin Party's election campaign
is happening at Songchon Rotary.

941
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,786
I hope she comes back safely.

942
01:21:59,454 --> 01:22:00,538
You mean Jeong-min?

943
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:01,581
Yes.

944
01:22:02,832 --> 01:22:03,875
I hope so too.

945
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:08,379
EVERGREEN BOOKSTORE

946
01:22:09,547 --> 01:22:10,632
Hurry!

947
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:13,468
-Run!
-Run!

948
01:22:13,551 --> 01:22:17,597
-One, two!
-One, two!

949
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,268
-One, two!
-One, two!

950
01:22:30,735 --> 01:22:31,861
Seung-jun.

951
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:45,333
Let's go to the dorm.

952
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:21,828
Out of the way!

953
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:27,917
Seung-jun, this way. Dong-jae, that way.

954
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,546
Hey, you can't…

955
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:43,141
I'm so scared.

956
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,177
Who are you people?

957
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:23,514
We need to search the dorm right now.

958
01:24:25,725 --> 01:24:26,642
What's this about?

959
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:29,645
A man who's been shot is hiding in here.

960
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:30,897
Show me a search warrant.

961
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,235
-Without a warrant, I won't let--
-Look.

962
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:39,989
We're chasing a North Korean spy!

963
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:43,618
Without a warrant, I can't allow
any man in this girls' dormitory.

964
01:25:02,512 --> 01:25:03,721
If you don't let us,

965
01:25:04,555 --> 01:25:07,350
you'll be violating National Security Law.

966
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:09,435
You know that?

967
01:25:11,562 --> 01:25:12,980
You're in Hosu Women's University!

968
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:15,525
-According to our dorm rules--
-Are you kidding?

969
01:25:16,192 --> 01:25:17,485
We don't have time for this.

970
01:25:24,951 --> 01:25:25,868
Let's just go in.

971
01:25:26,369 --> 01:25:28,454
Jeong-min!

972
01:25:28,538 --> 01:25:29,831
Search thoroughly.

973
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:31,290
Yes, sir.

974
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:11,873
Hey.

975
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:34,687
<i>Do you recognize me?</i>

976
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,647
Didn't you hear? He's a North Korean spy.

977
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:37,815
He's not a spy.

978
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:39,775
<i>So you want to keep him in the dorm?</i>

979
01:26:39,901 --> 01:26:42,361
<i>Just tell him to leave at dawn.</i>

980
01:26:43,237 --> 01:26:46,490
I think Ms. Pi finds your room suspicious.

981
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:50,536
If you're lying about even
the smallest thing, you will pay for it.

982
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,955
<i>We can never let Bun-ok get wind of it.</i>

983
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:56,000
<i>If the information is useful,
you get 50 million won.</i>

984
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:58,336
<i>That bastard is Taedong River 1.
I'm sure of it.</i>

985
01:26:58,419 --> 01:27:00,922
<i>If he's in here,
he's like a rat in a trap.</i>

986
01:27:01,005 --> 01:27:03,841
<i>Where can we hide him
in this girls' dormitory?</i>

987
01:27:04,508 --> 01:27:06,344
We'll be arrested too.

988
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:10,890
<i>It's D-day. We must capture him.</i>

989
01:27:21,108 --> 01:27:23,903

<i>Snow full of love falls down</i>

992
01:27:52,014 --> 01:27:55,726
<i>If there's a song about our love</i>

993
01:27:55,977 --> 01:27:59,021
<i>Our lives will become beautiful</i>

994
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:02,775
<i>Sorrowful dreams in this world</i>

995
01:28:03,526 --> 01:28:06,821
<i>Rain full of loneliness pours down</i>

996
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:11,450
<i>If you love with all your compassion</i>

997
01:28:11,784 --> 01:28:15,079
<i>There'll be only the truth and faith left</i>

998
01:28:15,204 --> 01:28:19,041
<i>If I'm a silent wanderer</i>

999
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:23,045
<i>I'll become a rock in this world</i>

1000
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:27,300
<i>-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love</i>

1001
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:30,594
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1002
01:28:30,678 --> 01:28:33,514
-One more time!
<i>-If I'm a silent</i>

-Wanderer</i>

1004
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:38,853
<i>-I'll become a rock in this world
-I'll become a rock in this world</i>

1005
01:28:38,936 --> 01:28:43,482
<i>-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love
-If I'm a wanderer looking for my love</i>

1006
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:47,278
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1007
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:52,825
<i>-I'll go to the end of this world
-I'll go to the end of this world</i>

1008
01:28:56,954 --> 01:28:58,039
This song's great.
