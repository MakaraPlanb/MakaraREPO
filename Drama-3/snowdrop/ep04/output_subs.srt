EPISODE 4

3
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,720
But this is…

4
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,307
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,019
I think I can only leave…

6
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,607
without worrying about you

7
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,860
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,376
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,629
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,094
Just keep it.

11
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,724
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,026
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,486
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,405
They're going to miss him.

15
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,657
Damn it.

16
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,751
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,753
If you know who he really is--

18
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,048
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,805
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,725
My roommates

21
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,728
have been hiding him.

22
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,773
He came into our room,

23
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,900
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,196
Darn it.

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,656
You traitor!

26
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,418
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,297
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,967
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,685
Will you be okay?

30
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,771
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,231
Go now.

32
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,535
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,704
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,044
Hey!

36
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,807
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,643
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,188
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,522
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,901
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,902
Since what time?

42
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,072
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,033
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,302
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,762
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,807
Let's question him first.

47
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,104
I think

48
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,898
since the last time I was here,

49
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,401
I've been traumatized.

50
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,655
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,326
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,703
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,166
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,919
but you were wrong?

56
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,137
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,515
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,147
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,941
I'm so sorry.

61
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,445
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,670
I'm suddenly

63
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,090
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,926
You might be on our side,

65
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,971
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,645
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,856
Which side are you on?

68
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,945
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,534
That hurts!

70
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,412
My ribs!

71
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,125
I'm so sorry.

72
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,628
Please don't kill me.

73
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,005
What did you do wrong?

74
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,052
Actually…

75
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,849
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,519
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,188
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,398
Gwang-tae.

79
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,028
Actually?

80
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
Actually what?

81
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,324
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,409
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,538
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,752
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm so sorry.

86
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,439
Why are you so late?

88
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,526
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,403
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:34,949
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:40,288
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,535
Comrade.

93
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,670
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,549
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,636
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,888
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,477
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,898
I should report first.

99
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,037
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,414
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,542
don't hesitate…

102
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,129
to kill him.

103
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
What happened?

104
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,766
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,020
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,652
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,739
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,866
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,495
Your face is well known now,

111
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,249
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,635
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,381
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,969
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,513
They're my brother's.

116
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,849
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,062
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,325
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,786
He was so hot!

120
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,038
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,499
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,542
What are you talking about?

123
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,504
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,088
He was so manly.

125
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,381
What's he majoring in?

126
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,300
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,470
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,889
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,391
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,993
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,207
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,629
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,885
Bun-ok.

134
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,514
We need to talk.

135
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,415
How long has it been?

136
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,085
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,344
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,848
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,065
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,610
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,655
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,199
I'm so sorry.

144
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,119
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,832
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,669
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,511
Did you call him first?

148
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,016
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,481
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,441
I ran into him.

151
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,735
At a record shop?

152
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,991
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,039
That bastard…

155
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,208
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,504
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,173
didn't you?

158
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,883
No. I never did.

159
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,551
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,522
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,275
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,530
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,748
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
Thanks.

165
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,857
Damn it.

172
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,639
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,394
That's right.

174
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,730
Maybe…

175
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,150
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,235
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,445
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,491
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,242
Hold on.

180
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,205
That means that guy is…

181
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,793
the spy?

182
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,133
Hold on.

183
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,095
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,138
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,265
She must be so mad.

186
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,309
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,020
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,316
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,693
Darn it.

190
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Wait.

191
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,366
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,369
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,995
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,416
What if she finds it out?

195
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,419
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,421
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,299
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,428
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,097
That guy's gone.

201
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,182
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,769
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,104
Say good night.

204
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,772
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,298
Yeong-ro.

206
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,674
Yes?

207
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,801
Why are you so startled?

208
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,098
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,477
No, ma'am.

210
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,021
I didn't.

211
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,524
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,362
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,116
The open house is over.

214
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,910
Get it together,

215
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,162
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,079
Understood?

217
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,706
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,333
That'll be all.

219
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,417
Say good night.

220
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,682
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,646
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,190
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,235
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,819
Oh, that.

227
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,573
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,866
Right?

229
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,661
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,163
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,457
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,543
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,920
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,674
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,844
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,179
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,975
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,852
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,021
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,647
so get the money ready.

241
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,240
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,711
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,189
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,370
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,915
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,002
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,754
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,094
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,262
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,641
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,854
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,191
through social and economic means…

253
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,153
Hey, you.

254
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,239
No running.

255
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,085
God, I was so startled.

256
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,379
What's up?

257
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,676
My goodness. So they are

258
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,345
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,014
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,684
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,603
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,230
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,359
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,528
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,867
Thank you so much.

266
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,827
What's that now?

267
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,954
It's sweet potato!

268
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,376
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,211
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,839
All right.

272
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,011
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,637
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,557
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,058
I mean it.

276
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,810
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,188
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,105
Okay.

279
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:28,109
NO NAME

280
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,940
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,527
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,001
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,670
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,506
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,010
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,224
Take it.

287
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,935
What's all that?

288
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,187
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,149
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,068
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,987
What's with the orchid?

292
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,286
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,331
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,171
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,060
I joined the ANSP

296
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,936
for only one reason.

297
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,404
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,784
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,331
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:51,586
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,965
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,803
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,141
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,103
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,940
Why…

306
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,610
Why on earth…

307
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,084
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,422
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,382
So stay out of it.

310
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,800
Our agents?

311
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,137
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,681
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,202
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,544
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,507
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,969
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,110
Hello?

318
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,739
I called to ask you something.

319
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,160
You said

320
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,455
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,833
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,752
how much will I get?

323
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,547
The same amount?

324
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,762
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,223
Pardon?

326
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,433
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,560
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,147
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,738
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,907
What?

331
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,450
Turn in?

332
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,371
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,499
What are you talking about?

334
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,460
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,215
Come on.

336
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,008
Why are you going through that?

337
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,054
What's going on?

338
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,226
That's…

339
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,484
I'm sorry.

340
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,324
Well, this is…

341
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,620
I mean,

342
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,082
what happened is that…

343
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,005
Thank you for everything.

345
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,717
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,012
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,141
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,810
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,021
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,815
Oh, no.

351
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,569
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,822
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,908
My goodness.

354
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,683
The guy they hid

355
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,853
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,067
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,364
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,952
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:38,957
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,794
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,254
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,923
That's our duty.

363
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,550
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,513
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,185
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,648
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,609
I mean,

368
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,238
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,662
I am not.

370
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,331
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,377
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,838
50 million won?

373
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,509
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,053
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,390
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,442
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,653
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,370
If you understood,

379
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,499
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,252
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,965
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,384
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,553
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,472
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,433
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,852
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,397
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,733
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,861
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,781
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,783
No, they can easily make

392
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,410
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,797
Room 207.

394
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:37,093
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,681
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,101
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,312
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,858
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,192
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,778
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,119
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,330
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,217
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,927
I'll leave instead.

405
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,220
I helped him too--

406
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,597
Of course,

407
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,808
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,899
But…

409
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,152
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,531
He was

411
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,284
your partner, right?

412
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,543
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,130
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,680
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,142
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
From this moment on,

417
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,190
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,858
Pardon?

419
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,777
Even a phone call?

420
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,072
Get out!

421
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,133
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,638
Did you see it?

423
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,973
Did you?

424
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,642
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,310
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,897
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,774
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,529
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,330
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,250
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,965
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,677
Stop.

433
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,845
Let's go.

434
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
What's her problem?

435
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,432
You crazy b****!

436
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,766
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,186
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,188
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,899
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,343
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,472
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,102
Let's go.

443
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,608
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,153
My wound's been healed.

445
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,239
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,617
I'm relieved.

447
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,038
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,708
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,960
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,798
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,801
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,469
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,180
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,432
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,434
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,604
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,273
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,445
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,072
Don't forget that.

460
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,074
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,286
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,261
What did I tell you?

463
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,722
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,474
In any case,

465
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,102
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:45,317
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,236
But Comrade,

468
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,613
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:55,161
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,425
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,766
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,745
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,540
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,252
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,338
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,590
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,759
what matters is

478
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,928
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,598
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,767
All right. I think it's time

481
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,353
to clink our glasses.

482
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,488
Not just this time

483
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:17,409
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,913
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,249
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,922
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,593
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,351
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,353
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,982
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,941
Right?

492
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,367
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,960
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,893
Why the hell

495
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,438
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,483
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,611
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,488
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,490
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,494
What is wrong with you?

501
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:47,291
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,545
What?

503
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,469
I understand.

504
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,846
I get what you mean.

505
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,934
If we lose this election,

506
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,936
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,314
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,778
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,280
This is just an insurance.

510
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,117
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,703
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,372
All of us.

513
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,173
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,344
The vault?

515
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,642
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,270
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,403
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,585
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:18,006
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,966
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,885
Let me join you often.

522
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,471
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,182
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:34,356
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,611
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,029
No?

527
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,491
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,996
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,289
Stop it.

530
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,543
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,088
What is that about?

532
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,472
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,808
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,102
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,607
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,484
I should pay attention to.

537
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,449
How could you say that?

538
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,202
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,250
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,252
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,505
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,507
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,092
So if your husband dies,

544
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,346
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,817
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,945
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,655
to become king

548
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:08,408
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,539
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,083
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,853
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,146
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,442
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,487
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,032
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,204
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,875
My father's house.

559
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,751
Your father?

560
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,587
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,885
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:12,806
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:18,270
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,524
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,113
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,949
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,118
Cheers.

568
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,704
Goodness.

569
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,332
Yeong-ro…

570
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,126
Stop crying.

571
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,503
Stop.

572
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,018
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,022
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,941
big sisters to me.

575
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:10,364
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:19,915
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,793
I mean it.

578
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,181
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,434
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,561
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,110
I'll come visit you often.

584
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,927
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,437

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,817
It's been a while.

605
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,196
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,634
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,929
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,433
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,977
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,606
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:19,279
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,907
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,911
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,371
from Austria myself.

615
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,598
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,896
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,232
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,276
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,614
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,532
And once they do,

621
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,078
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,086
As I told you many times,

623
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,547
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,804
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,890
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,773
Your son…

627
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,528
misses his father so much,

628
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,488
Professor Han.

629
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,749
TAXI

630
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,627
Let's go.

631
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,124
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,792
Hey, driver!

633
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,419
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,057
Hey!

635
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,112
Damn it!

636
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,782
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,325
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,451
"Move"?

639
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,705
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,668
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,004
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,464
I lost them.

643
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,257
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,926
How will you compensate?

645
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,428
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,681
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,975
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,685
This is Galaxy.

649
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,146
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,452
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,466
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,845
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:17,016
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,019
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,565
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,900
I must succeed.

657
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,987
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,912
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,542
I'll be discreet

660
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,628
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,464
Let him go.

662
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,007
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,720
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,765
Sir!

665
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,686
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,856
If we can decipher--

667
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,050
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,427
What does it mean?

669
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,847
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,185
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:43,853
What are you doing?

672
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,246
Professor.

673
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,876
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,629
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,923
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:15,009
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,553
Go to the North

678
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,722
and get out of there with him.

679
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,230
What?

680
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,524
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,318
safely and in secret

682
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,905
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,838
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,758
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,138
that if you do what the North wants,

686
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,433
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,895
I'll give you my word.

688
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,774
Get some rest here.

689
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,839
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,425
Are you not coming with us?

691
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:41,095
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,598
Tonight at 22:00,

693
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,018
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,645
So I'll be there before then.

695
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,274
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,027
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,322
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,326
to kill him.

699
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,337
If we don't get this done,

700
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,591
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,470
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,097
Understood?

703
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,809
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

Hoping to go to the North

01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,965
as soon as possible."

710
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,801
So it was the dorm.

711
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,387
Let's go.

712
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,204
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,250
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,044
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:03,506
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,467
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,179
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,393
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,978
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,231
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,568
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,029
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,543
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,753
It's nothing.

725
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,589
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:49,343
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,057
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:03,190
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,568
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,188
Hello?

731
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,523
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,901
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:50,071
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,409
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,703
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,764
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,434
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,107
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:12,987
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,281
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,554
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,930
you and Dong-jae

743
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,141
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,308
Yes, sir.

745
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,726
We need to capture him.

746
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,937
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,773
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,521
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,065
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,276
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,571
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,157
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,743
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:06,911
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,662
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,998
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,542
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,503
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,964
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,424
looked so handsome.

761
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,469
And he asked me out!

762
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:41,153
Yeong-ro!

763
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,782
Yeong-ro…

764
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,495
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,622
Don't cry.

766
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,997
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,915
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,626
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,971
Hey!

770
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,849
What a pervert.

771
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,685
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,270
That punk.

773
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,189
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,111
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:06,822
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,200
Where are you going?

777
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,704
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,333
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,504
God damn it!

780
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,550
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:27,926
Are they after me?

782
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,638
What's going on?

783
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,728
I can't get caught.

784
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,946
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,869
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,373
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:09,510
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,220
Darn it!

789
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,722
God, my hips.

790
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:24,900
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,821
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,035
They must be near here.

793
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,872
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,415
Everyone stand by.

795
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,752
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,005
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,550
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,802
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,139
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,475
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,518
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,271
Wait a minute.

803
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:47,566
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,652
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,324
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,075
Come here.

807
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,496
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,334
My God.

809
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,374
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,417
Seol-hui.

811
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,420
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,465
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,968
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,469
and…

815
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,017
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,646
Don't cry.

817
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,464
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,758
Dad.

819
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,845
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,807
What's going on?

821
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,518
What's going on?

822
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,855
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,737
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,573
Hey, pal.

825
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,203
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:13,128
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:37,194
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,572
Hey.

829
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,742
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,494
Check upstairs.

831
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,883
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,140
Drop the gun!

833
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,520
Stay away.

834
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,274
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:26,571
One.

836
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,699
Two.

837
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,299
Three.

838
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,976
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,732
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,235
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,405
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:11,992
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,536
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,329
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,206
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,542
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,835
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,843
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,179
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,640
save a spy?

851
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,893
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,275
BONUS

853
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,302
Yeong-ro.

854
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,220
Everyone's ready.

855
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,229
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:27,317
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,152
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,572
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,241
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,912
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
