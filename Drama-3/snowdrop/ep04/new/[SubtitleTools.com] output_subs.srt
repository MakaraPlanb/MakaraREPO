EPISODE 4

3
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,720
But this is…

4
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,307
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,019
I think I can only leave…

6
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,607
without worrying about you

7
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,860
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,376
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,629
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,094
Just keep it.

11
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,724
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,026
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,486
What's taking them so long?

14
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,405
They're going to miss him.

15
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,657
Damn it.

16
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:11,751
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,753
If you know who he really is--

18
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:17,048
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,805
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,725
My roommates

21
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,728
have been hiding him.

22
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,773
He came into our room,

23
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:35,900
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:40,196
Darn it.

25
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,656
You traitor!

26
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,418
Yeong-ro!

27
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,297
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:00,967
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,685
Will you be okay?

30
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,771
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,231
Go now.

32
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:27,535
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,704
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,044
Hey!

36
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,807
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,643
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,188
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,522
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,901
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:00,902
Since what time?

42
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,072
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:07,033
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,302
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:27,762
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,807
Let's question him first.

47
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,104
I think

48
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,898
since the last time I was here,

49
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,401
I've been traumatized.

50
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,655
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:50,326
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,703
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,080
So you thought a guy

54
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,166
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:05:58,709 --> 00:05:59,919
but you were wrong?

56
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,259
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:09,137
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,515
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,147
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,941
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:25,445
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:42,670
I'm suddenly

63
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:46,090
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,926
You might be on our side,

65
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,971
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,645
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:01,856
Which side are you on?

68
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,945
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,534
That hurts!

70
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,412
My ribs!

71
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:21,125
I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,628
Please don't kill me.

73
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,005
What did you do wrong?

74
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,052
Actually…

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,849
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,519
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,188
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,398
Gwang-tae.

79
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,028
Actually?

80
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,364
Actually what?

81
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,324
What, you idiot?

82
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,409
I'll be discreet.

83
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:58,538
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:04,752
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,630
I'm so sorry.

86
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,521
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,439
Why are you so late?

88
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,526
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,403
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:34,949
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:40,288
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,535
Comrade.

93
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,670
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,549
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,636
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,888
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,477
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:48,898
I should report first.

99
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:03,037
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,414
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:08,542
don't hesitate…

102
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,129
to kill him.

103
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,679
What happened?

104
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,766
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:25,768
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,020
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,652
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,739
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:40,866
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:44,495
Your face is well known now,

111
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:48,249
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:59,635
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,381
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,969
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,513
They're my brother's.

116
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,849
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,062
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:04,325
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,786
He was so hot!

120
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,038
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:11,499
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:13,542
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,504
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,088
He was so manly.

125
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,381
What's he majoring in?

126
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,300
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:24,470
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:26,889
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,391
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,993
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:53,207
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,629
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,885
Bun-ok.

134
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,514
We need to talk.

135
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,415
How long has it been?

136
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,085
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,344
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,848
I don't follow you.

139
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,187
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,065
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,610
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:06,655
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm so sorry.

144
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,119
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:16,832
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,669
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,511
Did you call him first?

148
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,016
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:40,481
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:42,441
I ran into him.

151
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,735
At a record shop?

152
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,991
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:57,039
That bastard…

155
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,208
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,504
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:06,173
didn't you?

158
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,883
No. I never did.

159
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,551
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,522
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:25,275
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:29,530
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,748
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,959
Thanks.

165
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,857
Damn it.

172
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,639
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,394
That's right.

174
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,730
Maybe…

175
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:48,150
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,235
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,445
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,491
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,242
Hold on.

180
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:01,205
That means that guy is…

181
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,793
the spy?

182
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,133
Hold on.

183
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:16,095
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,138
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:20,265
She must be so mad.

186
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,309
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:25,020
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:29,316
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,693
Darn it.

190
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:34,446
Wait.

191
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,366
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,369
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,995
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:46,416
What if she finds it out?

195
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,419
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,421
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:54,299
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,968
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,428
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,097
That guy's gone.

201
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,182
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,769
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,104
Say good night.

204
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,772
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,298
Yeong-ro.

206
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,674
Yes?

207
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,801
Why are you so startled?

208
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,098
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,477
No, ma'am.

210
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,021
I didn't.

211
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,524
Pull yourself together.

212
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:57,362
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,116
The open house is over.

214
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,910
Get it together,

215
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,162
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,079
Understood?

217
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,706
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,333
That'll be all.

219
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,417
Say good night.

220
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,682
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,268
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,646
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:33,190
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,235
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:37,819
Oh, that.

227
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,573
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:42,866
Right?

229
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,661
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,163
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:32,457
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,543
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,920
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,674
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,844
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:46,179
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,975
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:51,852
You and your nagging again!

239
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,021
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:55,647
so get the money ready.

241
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,240
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,711
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,189
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,370
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,915
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,002
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,754
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:07,094
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:22:07,177 --> 00:22:09,262
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,641
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:17,854
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:21,191
through social and economic means…

253
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,153
Hey, you.

254
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,239
No running.

255
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,085
God, I was so startled.

256
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:42,379
What's up?

257
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,676
My goodness. So they are

258
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,345
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,014
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,684
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,603
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,230
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,359
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:06,528
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:11,867
Thank you so much.

266
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,827
What's that now?

267
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:15,954
It's sweet potato!

268
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:18,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,376
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,211
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:25,839
All right.

272
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:31,011
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:32,637
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:35,557
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,058
I mean it.

276
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,810
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:41,188
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,105
Okay.

279
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:28,109
NO NAME

280
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,940
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:10,527
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,001
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:28,670
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:31,506
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,010
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:41,224
Take it.

287
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,935
What's all that?

288
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,187
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,149
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:52,068
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:53,987
What's with the orchid?

292
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,286
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,331
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,171
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,060
I joined the ANSP

296
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:26,936
for only one reason.

297
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,404
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:40,784
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:46,331
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:51,586
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:55,965
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,803
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:05,141
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,103
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:11,940
Why…

306
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,610
Why on earth…

307
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:31,084
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:35,422
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,382
So stay out of it.

310
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:38,800
Our agents?

311
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:42,137
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,681
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:06,202
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:14,544
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:19,507
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:22,969
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:39,110
Hello?

318
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:42,739
I called to ask you something.

319
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,160
You said

320
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:50,455
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:53,833
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,752
how much will I get?

323
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,547
The same amount?

324
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:05,762
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:08,223
Pardon?

326
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:10,433
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,560
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:16,147
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,738
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,907
What?

331
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:27,450
Turn in?

332
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:31,371
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:34,499
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:37,460
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,215
Come on.

336
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,008
Why are you going through that?

337
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:48,054
What's going on?

338
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,226
That's…

339
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:01,484
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:08,324
Well, this is…

341
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,620
I mean,

342
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:16,082
what happened is that…

343
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:22,005
Thank you for everything.

345
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:25,717
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,012
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:33,141
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:30:33,224 --> 00:30:35,810
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,021
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:40,815
Oh, no.

351
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:44,569
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:47,822
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:49,908
My goodness.

354
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,683
The guy they hid

355
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:18,853
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:24,067
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,364
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:33,952
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:38,957
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,794
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:45,254
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,923
That's our duty.

363
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,550
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:53,513
You think they won't question you?

365
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:59,185
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,648
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,609
I mean,

368
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:10,238
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:17,662
I am not.

370
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,331
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:24,377
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:26,838
50 million won?

373
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:31,509
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:34,053
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:37,390
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:47,442
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,653
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,370
If you understood,

379
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,499
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:48,252
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,965
It's all my fault.

382
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:55,384
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,553
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:33:57,637 --> 00:33:59,472
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:02,433
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:04,852
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:08,397
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,733
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,861
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:16,781
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:18,783
No, they can easily make

392
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:21,410
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:32,797
Room 207.

394
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:37,093
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,681
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:45,101
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:48,312
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:51,858
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:53,192
Please let me be punished.

400
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,778
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,119
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,330
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:18,217
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:19,927
I'll leave instead.

405
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,220
I helped him too--

406
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:22,597
Of course,

407
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:25,808
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:32,899
But…

409
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:36,152
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:40,531
He was

411
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:43,284
your partner, right?

412
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,543
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:56,130
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:36:01,135 --> 00:36:04,680
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:08,142
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:10,770
From this moment on,

417
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:14,190
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,858
Pardon?

419
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:17,777
Even a phone call?

420
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:21,072
Get out!

421
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,133
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,638
Did you see it?

423
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:46,973
Did you?

424
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,642
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:51,310
Who do you think you are?

426
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:54,897
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,774
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,529
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:11,330
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:14,250
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:20,965
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,677
Stop.

433
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,845
Let's go.

434
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,638
What's her problem?

435
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:29,432
You crazy b****!

436
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,766
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,186
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,188
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:38,899
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,343
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,472
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:15,102
Let's go.

443
00:38:17,938 --> 00:38:20,608
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,153
My wound's been healed.

445
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:27,239
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:29,617
I'm relieved.

447
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:34,038
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,708
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,960
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,798
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:46,801
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,469
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,180
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:53,432
at all costs, okay?

455
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:55,434
I'll remember that.

456
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,604
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,273
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:06,445
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:08,072
Don't forget that.

460
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:10,074
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,286
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,261
What did I tell you?

463
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:33,722
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:35,474
In any case,

465
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,102
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:45,317
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,236
But Comrade,

468
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,613
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:55,161
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:09,425
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,766
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,745
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:41,540
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:45,252
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:47,338
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,590
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,759
what matters is

478
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,928
that our hearts are one.

479
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:57,598
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,767
All right. I think it's time

481
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:02,353
to clink our glasses.

482
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:12,488
Not just this time

483
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:17,409
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:20,913
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:23,249
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:29,922
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:34,593
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,351
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,353
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:47,982
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:48,941
Right?

492
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,367
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:07,960
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,893
Why the hell

495
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,438
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,483
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,611
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:36,488
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:38,490
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:42,494
What is wrong with you?

501
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:47,291
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,545
What?

503
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:58,469
I understand.

504
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:00,846
I get what you mean.

505
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,934
If we lose this election,

506
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,936
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,314
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:15,778
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:18,280
This is just an insurance.

510
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:22,117
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:24,703
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:26,372
All of us.

513
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:36,173
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:40,344
The vault?

515
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:46,642
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,270
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:57,403
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,585
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:18,006
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:18,966
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,885
Let me join you often.

522
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:24,471
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:27,182
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:34,356
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:39,611
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:41,029
No?

527
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,491
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:48,996
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,289
Stop it.

530
00:44:51,665 --> 00:44:54,543
You should watch what you say.

531
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:58,088
What is that about?

532
00:45:04,678 --> 00:45:06,472
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:09,808
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:12,102
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,607
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,484
I should pay attention to.

537
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:25,449
How could you say that?

538
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:28,202
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,250
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:37,252
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:39,505
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:45:39,588 --> 00:45:41,507
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:45:42,132 --> 00:45:44,092
So if your husband dies,

544
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,346
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:45:56,939 --> 00:45:59,817
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,945
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:04,655
to become king

548
00:46:04,738 --> 00:46:08,408
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:46:10,786 --> 00:46:13,539
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:16,083
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:21,338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,853
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:38,146
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:42,442
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,487
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:49,032
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:54,204
Your cousin's house?

558
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,875
My father's house.

559
00:46:58,667 --> 00:46:59,751
Your father?

560
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:01,587
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:07,885
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:47:07,968 --> 00:47:12,806
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:18,270
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,524
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:28,113
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,949
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:33,118
Cheers.

568
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:35,704
Goodness.

569
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:38,332
Yeong-ro…

570
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,126
Stop crying.

571
00:47:42,336 --> 00:47:43,503
Stop.

572
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,018
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:02,022
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,941
big sisters to me.

575
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:10,364
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:19,915
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:22,793
I mean it.

578
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:36,181
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:39,434
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:41,561
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:48,110
I'll come visit you often.

584
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,927
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

585

<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:23,437

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,817
It's been a while.

605
00:51:36,486 --> 00:51:38,196
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:51:55,255 --> 00:51:59,634
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,929
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:06,433
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,977
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,606
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:19,279
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:52:19,946 --> 00:52:21,907
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:25,911
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:52:26,995 --> 00:52:28,371
from Austria myself.

615
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:46,598
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,896
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:55,232
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:52:55,899 --> 00:52:58,276
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:02,614
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:53:03,406 --> 00:53:04,532
And once they do,

621
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:08,078
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:16,086
As I told you many times,

623
00:53:17,337 --> 00:53:19,547
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:53:21,716 --> 00:53:25,804
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,890
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,773
Your son…

627
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:41,528
misses his father so much,

628
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:43,488
Professor Han.

629
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:54,749
TAXI

630
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:57,627
Let's go.

631
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:36,124
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:37,792
Hey, driver!

633
00:54:37,876 --> 00:54:39,419
Hey, driver!

634
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:52,057
Hey!

635
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:06,112
Damn it!

636
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,782
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:10,325
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,451
"Move"?

639
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:15,705
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,668
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,004
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:24,464
I lost them.

643
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:26,257
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:27,926
How will you compensate?

645
00:55:28,885 --> 00:55:30,428
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:33,681
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:35,975
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,685
This is Galaxy.

649
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:40,146
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:54,452
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:08,466
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,845
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:17,016
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:20,019
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:23,565
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,900
I must succeed.

657
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:28,987
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,912
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:56:41,082 --> 00:56:42,542
I'll be discreet

660
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:45,628
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:47,464
Let him go.

662
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,007
Yes, sir.

663
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,720
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:57,765
Sir!

665
00:56:58,224 --> 00:57:01,686
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:04,856
If we can decipher--

667
00:57:29,923 --> 00:57:32,050
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,427
What does it mean?

669
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:37,847
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:42,185
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:43,853
What are you doing?

672
00:57:59,994 --> 00:58:01,246
Professor.

673
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,876
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:09,629
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,923
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:15,009
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:16,553
Go to the North

678
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:19,722
and get out of there with him.

679
00:58:26,312 --> 00:58:27,230
What?

680
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:29,524
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:32,318
safely and in secret

682
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:35,905
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:51,838
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,758
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:58:57,427 --> 00:59:00,138
that if you do what the North wants,

686
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:03,433
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:07,895
I'll give you my word.

688
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:11,774
Get some rest here.

689
00:59:32,253 --> 00:59:34,839
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,425
Are you not coming with us?

691
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:41,095
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:43,598
Tonight at 22:00,

693
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:47,018
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:48,645
So I'll be there before then.

695
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,274
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,027
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
00:59:57,904 --> 00:59:59,322
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:03,326
to kill him.

699
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,337
If we don't get this done,

700
01:00:16,297 --> 01:00:18,591
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,470
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:00:23,137 --> 01:00:24,097
Understood?

703
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:27,809
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:40,965
as soon as possible."

710
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,801
So it was the dorm.

711
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:46,387
Let's go.

712
01:02:50,993 --> 01:02:53,204
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:02:53,788 --> 01:02:57,250
What? On the phone?

714
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:00,044
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:03,506
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:03:03,923 --> 01:03:06,467
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:10,179
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:15,393
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:16,978
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:20,231
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:03:20,314 --> 01:03:23,568
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,029
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:40,543
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,753
It's nothing.

725
01:03:42,837 --> 01:03:44,589
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:49,343
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,057
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:03,190
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:05,568
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:42,188
Hello?

731
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,523
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:46,901
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:50,071
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:04:52,782 --> 01:04:55,409
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:04:55,493 --> 01:04:57,703
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:05:57,096 --> 01:05:58,764
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:01,434
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:08,107
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:12,987
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:06:13,946 --> 01:06:15,281
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:01,554
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:08:01,637 --> 01:08:02,930
you and Dong-jae

743
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:05,141
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:08:05,224 --> 01:08:06,308
Yes, sir.

745
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:07,726
We need to capture him.

746
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,937
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:08:11,105 --> 01:08:12,773
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:08:50,102 --> 01:08:52,521
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:08:52,605 --> 01:08:55,065
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:57,276
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:08:59,153 --> 01:09:00,571
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:09:00,654 --> 01:09:03,157
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,743
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:06,911
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:09:06,994 --> 01:09:08,662
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:09:08,746 --> 01:09:10,998
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:09:11,081 --> 01:09:13,542
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:16,503
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,964
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:20,424
looked so handsome.

761
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:23,469
And he asked me out!

762
01:09:37,942 --> 01:09:41,153
Yeong-ro!

763
01:09:43,197 --> 01:09:44,782
Yeong-ro…

764
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:49,495
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:51,622
Don't cry.

766
01:10:30,661 --> 01:10:32,997
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,915
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:37,626
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:10:47,636 --> 01:10:48,971
Hey!

770
01:10:50,055 --> 01:10:51,849
What a pervert.

771
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:54,685
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:56,270
That punk.

773
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:59,189
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:11:01,025 --> 01:11:04,111
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:11:04,194 --> 01:11:06,822
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,200
Where are you going?

777
01:11:10,284 --> 01:11:13,704
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:17,333
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:11:21,086 --> 01:11:22,504
God damn it!

780
01:11:23,672 --> 01:11:26,550
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:27,926
Are they after me?

782
01:11:30,304 --> 01:11:31,638
What's going on?

783
01:11:36,018 --> 01:11:37,728
I can't get caught.

784
01:11:43,901 --> 01:11:47,946
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,869
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:11:54,787 --> 01:11:57,373
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:09,510
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,220
Darn it!

789
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:13,722
God, my hips.

790
01:12:21,146 --> 01:12:24,900
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:12:25,943 --> 01:12:28,821
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:17,035
They must be near here.

793
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:19,872
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:21,415
Everyone stand by.

795
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,752
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:28,005
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,550
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:13:31,884 --> 01:13:33,802
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:37,139
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:13:37,931 --> 01:13:39,475
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:41,518
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:13:42,102 --> 01:13:44,271
Wait a minute.

803
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:47,566
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:13:48,692 --> 01:13:50,652
Did you just hit me?

805
01:13:51,987 --> 01:13:55,324
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:57,075
Come here.

807
01:13:57,784 --> 01:14:00,496
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:05,334
My God.

809
01:14:43,622 --> 01:14:45,374
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,417
Seol-hui.

811
01:14:48,544 --> 01:14:50,420
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:14:51,797 --> 01:14:53,465
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:55,968
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:14:56,552 --> 01:14:57,469
and…

815
01:15:01,098 --> 01:15:04,017
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:07,646
Don't cry.

817
01:15:30,294 --> 01:15:34,464
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:15:35,841 --> 01:15:36,758
Dad.

819
01:15:36,842 --> 01:15:39,845
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:43,807
What's going on?

821
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:46,518
What's going on?

822
01:15:46,602 --> 01:15:49,855
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:56,737
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:15:57,696 --> 01:15:59,573
Hey, pal.

825
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:05,203
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:13,128
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:37,194
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:40,572
Hey.

829
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:43,742
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:16:44,493 --> 01:16:45,494
Check upstairs.

831
01:19:03,507 --> 01:19:04,883
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:19:10,597 --> 01:19:12,140
Drop the gun!

833
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:16,520
Stay away.

834
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:21,274
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,571
One.

836
01:19:28,532 --> 01:19:29,699
Two.

837
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:46,299
Three.

838
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:55,976
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:20:00,814 --> 01:20:02,732
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,235
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:08,405
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:20:08,488 --> 01:20:11,992
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:20:12,075 --> 01:20:14,536
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:16,329
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:18,206
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:20,542
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:21,835
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:29,843
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:20:30,427 --> 01:20:33,179
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,640
save a spy?

851
01:20:36,308 --> 01:20:37,893
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,275
BONUS

853
01:21:11,426 --> 01:21:12,302
Yeong-ro.

854
01:21:13,053 --> 01:21:14,220
Everyone's ready.

855
01:21:19,601 --> 01:21:23,229
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:21:24,856 --> 01:21:27,317
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,152
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:21:30,403 --> 01:21:32,572
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:21:32,656 --> 01:21:35,241
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:38,912
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
