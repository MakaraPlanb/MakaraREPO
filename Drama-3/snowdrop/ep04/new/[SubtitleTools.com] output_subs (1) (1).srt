EPISODE 4

3
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,720
But this is…

4
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,307
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:15,019
I think I can only leave…

6
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,607
without worrying about you

7
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,860
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,376
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,629
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,094
Just keep it.

11
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,724
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,026
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,486
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,405
They're going to miss him.

15
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,657
Damn it.

16
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:20,751
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,753
If you know who he really is--

18
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,048
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:32,805
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,725
My roommates

21
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,728
have been hiding him.

22
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,773
He came into our room,

23
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,900
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,196
Darn it.

25
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,656
You traitor!

26
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,418
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:06,297
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,967
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,685
Will you be okay?

30
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,771
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,231
Go now.

32
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,535
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:38,704
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,044
Hey!

36
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,807
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,643
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,188
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,522
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,901
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:09,902
Since what time?

42
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:13,072
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:16,033
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,302
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,762
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,807
Let's question him first.

47
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,104
I think

48
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,898
since the last time I was here,

49
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,401
I've been traumatized.

50
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:54,655
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:59,326
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,703
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:03,080
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,166
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:08,919
but you were wrong?

56
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,259
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,137
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,515
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,147
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,941
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,445
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:51,670
I'm suddenly

63
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:55,090
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:57,926
You might be on our side,

65
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,971
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,645
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,856
Which side are you on?

68
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,945
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,534
That hurts!

70
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,412
My ribs!

71
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:30,125
I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,628
Please don't kill me.

73
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,005
What did you do wrong?

74
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,052
Actually…

75
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,849
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,519
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,188
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,398
Gwang-tae.

79
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,028
Actually?

80
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,364
Actually what?

81
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,324
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,409
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,538
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,752
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:16,630
I'm so sorry.

86
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,521
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:34,439
Why are you so late?

88
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,526
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,403
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,949
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:49,288
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:28,535
Comrade.

93
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,670
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:42,549
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,636
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,888
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,477
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:57,898
I should report first.

99
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:12,037
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,414
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,542
don't hesitate…

102
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,129
to kill him.

103
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,679
What happened?

104
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,766
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,768
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,020
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,652
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,739
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:49,866
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,495
Your face is well known now,

111
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:57,249
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,635
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:46,381
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,969
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,513
They're my brother's.

116
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,849
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,062
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:13,325
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,786
He was so hot!

120
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,038
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,499
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:22,542
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:25,504
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,088
He was so manly.

125
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,381
What's he majoring in?

126
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,300
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,470
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,889
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,391
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,993
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:02,207
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,629
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,885
Bun-ok.

134
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,514
We need to talk.

135
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:43,415
How long has it been?

136
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,085
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,344
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,848
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,187
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,065
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,610
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:15,655
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:18,199
I'm so sorry.

144
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:21,119
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:25,832
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,669
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,511
Did you call him first?

148
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:43,016
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:49,481
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,441
I ran into him.

151
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,735
At a record shop?

152
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,991
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:06,039
That bastard…

155
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,208
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,504
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:15,173
didn't you?

158
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,883
No. I never did.

159
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,551
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,522
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:34,275
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:38,530
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,748
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:50,959
Thanks.

165
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,857
Damn it.

172
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,639
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,394
That's right.

174
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,730
Maybe…

175
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,150
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,235
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,445
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,491
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,242
Hold on.

180
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,205
That means that guy is…

181
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,793
the spy?

182
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,133
Hold on.

183
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,095
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,138
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,265
She must be so mad.

186
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,309
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:34,020
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:38,316
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,693
Darn it.

190
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,446
Wait.

191
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,366
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,369
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:50,995
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,416
What if she finds it out?

195
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,419
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:00,421
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,299
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,968
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,428
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,097
That guy's gone.

201
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,182
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,769
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,104
Say good night.

204
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,772
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,298
Yeong-ro.

206
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:44,674
Yes?

207
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,801
Why are you so startled?

208
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:52,098
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,477
No, ma'am.

210
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,021
I didn't.

211
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:01,524
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:06,362
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:10,116
The open house is over.

214
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,910
Get it together,

215
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:14,162
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,079
Understood?

217
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:16,706
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,333
That'll be all.

219
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,417
Say good night.

220
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:34,682
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,268
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:39,646
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,190
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,235
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,819
Oh, that.

227
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:50,573
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,866
Right?

229
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:54,661
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,163
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:41,457
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,543
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,920
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,674
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,844
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,179
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:58,975
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,852
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,021
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,647
so get the money ready.

241
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,240
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,711
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,189
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:21:56,491 --> 00:22:00,370
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:03,915
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,002
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,754
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:16,094
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:18,262
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,641
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:26,854
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,191
through social and economic means…

253
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:34,153
Hey, you.

254
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,239
No running.

255
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,085
God, I was so startled.

256
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,379
What's up?

257
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,676
My goodness. So they are

258
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,345
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:02,014
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,684
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,603
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,230
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:13,359
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,528
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:20,867
Thank you so much.

266
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,827
What's that now?

267
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:24,954
It's sweet potato!

268
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,376
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,211
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:34,839
All right.

272
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:40,011
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,637
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,557
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,058
I mean it.

276
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:47,810
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,188
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:51,105
Okay.

279
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:37,109
NO NAME

280
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,940
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,527
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,001
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,670
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,506
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,010
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:50,224
Take it.

287
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,935
What's all that?

288
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,187
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:58,149
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:01,068
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:02,987
What's with the orchid?

292
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,286
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,331
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,171
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,060
I joined the ANSP

296
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:35,936
for only one reason.

297
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,404
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,784
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:55,331
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:26:55,831 --> 00:27:00,586
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,965
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:08,803
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:14,141
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,103
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,940
Why…

306
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,610
Why on earth…

307
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:40,084
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,422
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,382
So stay out of it.

310
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,800
Our agents?

311
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:51,137
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,681
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:15,202
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,544
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:28,507
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:31,969
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,110
Hello?

318
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,739
I called to ask you something.

319
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,160
You said

320
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:59,455
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,833
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,752
how much will I get?

323
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:08,547
The same amount?

324
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,762
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,223
Pardon?

326
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,433
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:21,560
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:25,147
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,738
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:34,907
What?

331
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,450
Turn in?

332
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:40,371
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,499
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,460
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,215
Come on.

336
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,008
Why are you going through that?

337
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,054
What's going on?

338
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:02,226
That's…

339
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:10,484
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,324
Well, this is…

341
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:21,620
I mean,

342
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:25,082
what happened is that…

343
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:27,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,005
Thank you for everything.

345
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:34,717
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,012
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:42,141
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,810
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:47,021
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:49,815
Oh, no.

351
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:53,569
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,822
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:58,908
My goodness.

354
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,683
The guy they hid

355
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,853
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:33,067
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:38,364
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,952
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:47,957
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,794
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,254
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,923
That's our duty.

363
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,550
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:02,513
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:08,185
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,648
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:15,609
I mean,

368
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:19,238
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,662
I am not.

370
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,331
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:33,377
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,838
50 million won?

373
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:40,509
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,053
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:46,390
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,442
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,653
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,370
If you understood,

379
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,499
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,252
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:01,965
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,384
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,553
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,472
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,433
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,852
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,397
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:19,733
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,861
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:25,781
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,783
No, they can easily make

392
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,410
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,797
Room 207.

394
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:46,093
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,681
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,101
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:57,312
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,858
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,192
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,778
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,119
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,330
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:27,217
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:28,927
I'll leave instead.

405
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:30,220
I helped him too--

406
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,597
Of course,

407
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,808
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,899
But…

409
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,152
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:49,531
He was

411
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:52,284
your partner, right?

412
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,543
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:05,130
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:13,680
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:17,142
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,770
From this moment on,

417
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:23,190
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:24,858
Pardon?

419
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,777
Even a phone call?

420
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:30,072
Get out!

421
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,133
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,638
Did you see it?

423
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,973
Did you?

424
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,642
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,310
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:03,897
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,774
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,529
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:20,330
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,250
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:29,965
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:33,677
Stop.

433
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,845
Let's go.

434
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:36,638
What's her problem?

435
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,432
You crazy b****!

436
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:39,766
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,186
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,188
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,899
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,343
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,472
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:24,102
Let's go.

443
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,608
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:33,153
My wound's been healed.

445
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,239
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,617
I'm relieved.

447
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:43,038
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,708
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,960
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:52,798
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:55,801
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,469
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:00,180
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:02,432
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,434
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:07,604
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:10,273
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:15,445
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,072
Don't forget that.

460
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,074
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:23,286
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,261
What did I tell you?

463
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:42,722
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,474
In any case,

465
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,102
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:54,317
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,236
But Comrade,

468
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,613
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:04,161
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:18,425
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,766
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:46,745
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:50,540
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:54,252
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,338
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:58,590
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,759
what matters is

478
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,928
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:06,598
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,767
All right. I think it's time

481
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,353
to clink our glasses.

482
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:21,488
Not just this time

483
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:26,409
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,913
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:32,249
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:38,922
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:43,593
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,351
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:53,353
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:56,982
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:57,941
Right?

492
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,367
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:16,960
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:33,893
Why the hell

495
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:36,438
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:40,483
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,611
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:45,488
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:47,490
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:51,494
What is wrong with you?

501
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:56,291
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:00,545
What?

503
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,469
I understand.

504
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:09,846
I get what you mean.

505
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:14,934
If we lose this election,

506
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:16,936
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,314
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:24,778
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:27,280
This is just an insurance.

510
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:31,117
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,703
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:35,372
All of us.

513
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:45,173
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:49,344
The vault?

515
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:55,642
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:59,270
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:06,403
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,585
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:27,006
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:27,966
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,885
Let me join you often.

522
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,471
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,182
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:43,356
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:48,611
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:50,029
No?

527
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,491
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:57,996
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,289
Stop it.

530
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:03,543
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:07,088
What is that about?

532
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:15,472
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:18,808
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:21,102
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,607
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,484
I should pay attention to.

537
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:34,449
How could you say that?

538
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,202
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:44,250
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,252
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:45:46,336 --> 00:45:48,505
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:50,507
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:53,092
So if your husband dies,

544
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,346
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:08,817
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,945
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:13,655
to become king

548
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:17,408
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:22,539
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,083
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:30,338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:46:42,892 --> 00:46:44,853
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,146
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:51,442
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:54,487
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:58,032
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:03,204
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:06,875
My father's house.

559
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:08,751
Your father?

560
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:10,587
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:16,885
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:21,806
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:27,270
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,524
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:37,113
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:39,949
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,118
Cheers.

568
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:44,704
Goodness.

569
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,332
Yeong-ro…

570
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,126
Stop crying.

571
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,503
Stop.

572
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:07,018
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:11,022
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,941
big sisters to me.

575
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:19,364
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:28,915
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,793
I mean it.

578
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:45,181
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:48,434
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:50,561
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:57,110
I'll come visit you often.

584
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,927
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

585

<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:49:29,684 --> 00:49:32,437

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,817
It's been a while.

605
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:47,196
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:08,634
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,929
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:15,433
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,977
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,606
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:28,279
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:30,907
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:34,911
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:37,371
from Austria myself.

615
00:52:53,054 --> 00:52:55,598
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,896
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,232
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:07,276
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,614
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,532
And once they do,

621
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:17,078
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:25,086
As I told you many times,

623
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:28,547
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:34,804
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,890
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,773
Your son…

627
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:50,528
misses his father so much,

628
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:52,488
Professor Han.

629
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:03,749
TAXI

630
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:06,627
Let's go.

631
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:45,124
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:46,792
Hey, driver!

633
00:54:46,876 --> 00:54:48,419
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:00,056 --> 00:55:01,057
Hey!

635
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,112
Damn it!

636
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:17,782
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:19,325
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:55:19,408 --> 00:55:20,451
"Move"?

639
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:24,705
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,668
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:32,004
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:33,464
I lost them.

643
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,257
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:36,926
How will you compensate?

645
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:39,428
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,681
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,975
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,685
This is Galaxy.

649
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:49,146
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:03,452
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:17,466
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,845
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:26,016
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,019
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:32,565
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:34,900
I must succeed.

657
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:37,987
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,912
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:56:50,082 --> 00:56:51,542
I'll be discreet

660
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:54,628
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:56,464
Let him go.

662
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:58,007
Yes, sir.

663
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:02,720
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,765
Sir!

665
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,686
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:13,856
If we can decipher--

667
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,050
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,427
What does it mean?

669
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,847
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:51,185
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:52,853
What are you doing?

672
00:58:08,994 --> 00:58:10,246
Professor.

673
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,876
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,629
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,923
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:24,009
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:25,553
Go to the North

678
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:28,722
and get out of there with him.

679
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:36,230
What?

680
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,524
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:41,318
safely and in secret

682
00:58:43,112 --> 00:58:44,905
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,838
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:04,758
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:06,427 --> 00:59:09,138
that if you do what the North wants,

686
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:12,433
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,895
I'll give you my word.

688
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:20,774
Get some rest here.

689
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:43,839
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
00:59:44,673 --> 00:59:46,425
Are you not coming with us?

691
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:50,095
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:52,598
Tonight at 22:00,

693
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,018
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
00:59:56,101 --> 00:59:57,645
So I'll be there before then.

695
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,274
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:05,027
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,322
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,326
to kill him.

699
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:23,337
If we don't get this done,

700
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:27,591
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,470
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:00:32,137 --> 01:00:33,097
Understood?

703
01:00:34,223 --> 01:00:36,809
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

Hoping to go to the North

01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:49,965
as soon as possible."

710
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,801
So it was the dorm.

711
01:01:54,052 --> 01:01:55,387
Let's go.

712
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:02,204
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:06,250
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,044
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:03:10,128 --> 01:03:12,506
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,467
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,179
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:24,393
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:25,978
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:29,231
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:32,568
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:36,029
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:49,543
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,753
It's nothing.

725
01:03:51,837 --> 01:03:53,589
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:58,343
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,057
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:12,190
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,568
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:04:49,603 --> 01:04:51,188
Hello?

731
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:53,523
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:55,901
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:04:55,984 --> 01:04:59,071
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:04,409
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:06,703
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,764
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:10,434
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:06:14,396 --> 01:06:17,107
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:06:20,902 --> 01:06:21,987
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,281
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:10,554
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:11,930
you and Dong-jae

743
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:14,141
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:15,308
Yes, sir.

745
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:16,726
We need to capture him.

746
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,937
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:21,773
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:01,521
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,065
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:06,276
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:09:08,153 --> 01:09:09,571
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:12,157
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,743
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:09:14,826 --> 01:09:15,911
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:17,662
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:19,998
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:22,542
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:25,503
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:09:25,587 --> 01:09:27,964
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:29,424
looked so handsome.

761
01:09:31,092 --> 01:09:32,469
And he asked me out!

762
01:09:46,942 --> 01:09:50,153
Yeong-ro!

763
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:53,782
Yeong-ro…

764
01:09:56,952 --> 01:09:58,495
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:09:59,371 --> 01:10:00,622
Don't cry.

766
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:41,997
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,915
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:46,626
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:10:56,636 --> 01:10:57,971
Hey!

770
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,849
What a pervert.

771
01:11:01,599 --> 01:11:03,685
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:05,270
That punk.

773
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:08,189
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:11:10,025 --> 01:11:13,111
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:15,822
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,200
Where are you going?

777
01:11:19,284 --> 01:11:22,704
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,333
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,504
God damn it!

780
01:11:32,672 --> 01:11:35,550
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:11:35,633 --> 01:11:36,926
Are they after me?

782
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:40,638
What's going on?

783
01:11:45,018 --> 01:11:46,728
I can't get caught.

784
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:56,946
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,869
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:06,373
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:18,510
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,220
Darn it!

789
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:22,722
God, my hips.

790
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:33,900
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:37,821
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:13:24,742 --> 01:13:26,035
They must be near here.

793
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:28,872
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:13:28,955 --> 01:13:30,415
Everyone stand by.

795
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:34,752
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:37,005
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:40,550
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:42,802
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:13:43,845 --> 01:13:46,139
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:48,475
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,518
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:13:51,102 --> 01:13:53,271
Wait a minute.

803
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:56,566
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:13:57,692 --> 01:13:59,652
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:00,987 --> 01:14:04,324
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:04,991 --> 01:14:06,075
Come here.

807
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:09,496
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:14:12,874 --> 01:14:14,334
My God.

809
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,374
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,417
Seol-hui.

811
01:14:57,544 --> 01:14:59,420
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,465
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:02,549 --> 01:15:04,968
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:05,552 --> 01:15:06,469
and…

815
01:15:10,098 --> 01:15:13,017
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:16,646
Don't cry.

817
01:15:39,294 --> 01:15:43,464
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,758
Dad.

819
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:48,845
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:52,807
What's going on?

821
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,518
What's going on?

822
01:15:55,602 --> 01:15:58,855
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:05,737
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:08,573
Hey, pal.

825
01:16:12,994 --> 01:16:14,203
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,128
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:16:43,024 --> 01:16:46,194
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:49,572
Hey.

829
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,742
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:16:53,493 --> 01:16:54,494
Check upstairs.

831
01:19:12,507 --> 01:19:13,883
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:19:19,597 --> 01:19:21,140
Drop the gun!

833
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:25,520
Stay away.

834
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:30,274
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,571
One.

836
01:19:37,532 --> 01:19:38,699
Two.

837
01:19:53,798 --> 01:19:55,299
Three.

838
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,976
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:20:09,814 --> 01:20:11,732
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:14,235
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:17,405
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:20,992
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:20:21,075 --> 01:20:23,536
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,329
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:27,206
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,542
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:30,835
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:38,843
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:20:39,427 --> 01:20:42,179
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,640
save a spy?

851
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:46,893
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,275
BONUS

853
01:21:20,426 --> 01:21:21,302
Yeong-ro.

854
01:21:22,053 --> 01:21:23,220
Everyone's ready.

855
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:32,229
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:36,317
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,152
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:21:39,403 --> 01:21:41,572
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:21:41,656 --> 01:21:44,241
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:21:44,325 --> 01:21:47,912
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
