EPISODE 4

3
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,220
But this is…

4
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:12,807
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,519
I think I can only leave…

6
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,107
without worrying about you

7
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,360
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,876
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,129
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:50,594
Just keep it.

11
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,224
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,526
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:06,986
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,905
They're going to miss him.

15
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,157
Damn it.

16
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:22,251
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,253
If you know who he really is--

18
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:27,548
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:34,305
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,225
My roommates

21
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,228
have been hiding him.

22
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,273
He came into our room,

23
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,400
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,696
Darn it.

25
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,156
You traitor!

26
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,918
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,797
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,467
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,185
Will you be okay?

30
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,271
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,731
Go now.

32
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,035
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,204
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,544
Hey!

36
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,307
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:03,143
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,688
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,022
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,401
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,402
Since what time?

42
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:14,572
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,533
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,802
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,262
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,307
Let's question him first.

47
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,604
I think

48
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,398
since the last time I was here,

49
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,901
I've been traumatized.

50
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,155
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:05:56,238 --> 00:06:00,826
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,203
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,580
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,666
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,419
but you were wrong?

56
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,759
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:19,637
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,015
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,647
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,441
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,945
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,170
I'm suddenly

63
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,590
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,426
You might be on our side,

65
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:02,471
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:10,145
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,356
Which side are you on?

68
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,445
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,034
That hurts!

70
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,912
My ribs!

71
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,625
I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,128
Please don't kill me.

73
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,505
What did you do wrong?

74
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:41,552
Actually…

75
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,349
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,019
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,688
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,898
Gwang-tae.

79
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,528
Actually?

80
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,864
Actually what?

81
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,824
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,909
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,038
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,252
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,130
I'm so sorry.

86
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,021
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,939
Why are you so late?

88
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,026
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,903
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:45,449
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:50,788
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,035
Comrade.

93
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:40,170
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:44,049
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,136
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,388
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,977
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:09:57,938 --> 00:09:59,398
I should report first.

99
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,537
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,914
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,042
don't hesitate…

102
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,629
to kill him.

103
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,179
What happened?

104
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,266
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,268
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,520
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,152
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,239
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,366
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,995
Your face is well known now,

111
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,749
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:10,135
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,881
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,469
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,013
They're my brother's.

116
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,349
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,562
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:14,825
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,286
He was so hot!

120
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,538
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,999
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,042
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:27,004
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,588
He was so manly.

125
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:29,881
What's he majoring in?

126
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,800
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,970
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:37,389
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:39,891
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,493
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,707
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,129
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,385
Bun-ok.

134
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,014
We need to talk.

135
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:44,915
How long has it been?

136
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,585
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,844
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,348
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,687
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,565
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,110
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:17,155
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:19,699
I'm so sorry.

144
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,619
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:27,332
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,169
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,011
Did you call him first?

148
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,516
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:50,981
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,941
I ran into him.

151
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,235
At a record shop?

152
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,446
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,491
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,539
That bastard…

155
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:09,708
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,004
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,673
didn't you?

158
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,383
No. I never did.

159
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,051
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,022
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:35,775
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:40,030
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,248
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,459
Thanks.

165
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,357
Damn it.

172
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:48,139
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:52,894
That's right.

174
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,230
Maybe…

175
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,650
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,735
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,945
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,991
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:07,742
Hold on.

180
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,705
That means that guy is…

181
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,293
the spy?

182
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:23,633
Hold on.

183
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,595
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,638
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,765
She must be so mad.

186
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,809
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:35,520
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,816
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,193
Darn it.

190
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:44,946
Wait.

191
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,866
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,869
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,495
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:56,916
What if she finds it out?

195
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,919
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,921
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,799
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,468
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,928
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:10,597
That guy's gone.

201
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,682
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,269
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:17,604
Say good night.

204
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:19,272
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:44,798
Yeong-ro.

206
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,174
Yes?

207
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,301
Why are you so startled?

208
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,598
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:57,977
No, ma'am.

210
00:18:58,061 --> 00:18:59,521
I didn't.

211
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,024
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:07,862
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,616
The open house is over.

214
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,410
Get it together,

215
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,662
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:16,579
Understood?

217
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:18,206
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,833
That'll be all.

219
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:20,917
Say good night.

220
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,670
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:36,182
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,768
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:41,146
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,690
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,735
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,319
Oh, that.

227
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,073
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,366
Right?

229
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,161
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,663
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,957
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,043
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,420
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:51,174
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,344
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,679
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:20:56,763 --> 00:21:00,475
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,352
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,521
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,147
so get the money ready.

241
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:15,740
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,211
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,689
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:01,870
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:05,415
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,502
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,254
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:17,594
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:19,762
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:23,141
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:28,354
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,691
through social and economic means…

253
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:35,653
Hey, you.

254
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:37,739
No running.

255
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,585
God, I was so startled.

256
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:52,879
What's up?

257
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,176
My goodness. So they are

258
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,845
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,514
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,184
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:09,103
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,730
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,859
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:17,028
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,367
Thank you so much.

266
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,327
What's that now?

267
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:26,454
It's sweet potato!

268
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,831
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,876
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,711
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:36,339
All right.

272
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:41,511
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,137
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,057
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,558
I mean it.

276
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:49,310
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,688
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:52,605
Okay.

279
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:38,609
NO NAME

280
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,440
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,027
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,501
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,170
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:42,006
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,510
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:51,724
Take it.

287
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,435
What's all that?

288
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:56,687
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,649
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:02,568
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,487
What's with the orchid?

292
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,786
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,831
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,671
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:35,560
I joined the ANSP

296
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,436
for only one reason.

297
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,904
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,284
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,831
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:02,086
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:06,465
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:10,303
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:15,641
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,603
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:22,440
Why…

306
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,110
Why on earth…

307
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:41,584
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,922
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,882
So stay out of it.

310
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,300
Our agents?

311
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,637
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,181
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:16,702
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,044
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:30,007
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,469
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,610
Hello?

318
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,239
I called to ask you something.

319
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,660
You said

320
00:28:57,743 --> 00:29:00,955
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,333
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,252
how much will I get?

323
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,047
The same amount?

324
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,262
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:18,723
Pardon?

326
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:20,933
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:23,060
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:26,647
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,238
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:36,407
What?

331
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:37,950
Turn in?

332
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:41,871
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,999
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:47,960
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,715
Come on.

336
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,508
Why are you going through that?

337
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,554
What's going on?

338
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:03,726
That's…

339
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:11,984
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,824
Well, this is…

341
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:23,120
I mean,

342
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:26,582
what happened is that…

343
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:28,501
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,505
Thank you for everything.

345
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:36,217
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,512
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,641
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:46,310
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,521
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:51,315
Oh, no.

351
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:55,069
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:58,322
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,408
My goodness.

354
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,183
The guy they hid

355
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,353
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:34,567
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,864
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:44,452
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:49,457
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,294
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,754
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:57,423
That's our duty.

363
00:31:57,506 --> 00:32:00,050
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,013
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:09,685
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,148
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,109
I mean,

368
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,738
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,162
I am not.

370
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,831
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,877
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,338
50 million won?

373
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:42,009
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,553
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:47,890
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,942
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:01,153
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,870
If you understood,

379
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,999
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,752
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:03,465
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,884
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,053
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:09,972
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:34:10,723 --> 00:34:12,933
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,352
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:18,897
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:21,233
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:24,361
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,281
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,283
No, they can easily make

392
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,910
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:43,297
Room 207.

394
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:47,593
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,181
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,601
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,812
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:02,358
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:03,692
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:06,278
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:13,619
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,830
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,717
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,427
I'll leave instead.

405
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,720
I helped him too--

406
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,097
Of course,

407
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,308
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:43,399
But…

409
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:46,652
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,031
He was

411
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,784
your partner, right?

412
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,043
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:06,630
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:15,180
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:18,642
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:21,270
From this moment on,

417
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:24,690
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:26,358
Pardon?

419
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,277
Even a phone call?

420
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,572
Get out!

421
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,633
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,138
Did you see it?

423
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:57,473
Did you?

424
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,142
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,810
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:05,397
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:07,274
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:12,029
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:21,830
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:24,750
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:31,465
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,177
Stop.

433
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,345
Let's go.

434
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,138
What's her problem?

435
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,932
You crazy b****!

436
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:41,266
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,686
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,688
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:49,399
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,843
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,972
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:25,602
Let's go.

443
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:31,108
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,653
My wound's been healed.

445
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,739
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:40,117
I'm relieved.

447
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:44,538
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,208
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,460
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:54,298
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:57,301
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:58,969
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,680
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:03,932
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,934
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:09,104
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:09,187 --> 00:39:11,773
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:16,945
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,572
Don't forget that.

460
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:20,574
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:24,786
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:40,761
What did I tell you?

463
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,222
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:45,974
In any case,

465
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,602
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:55,817
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:57,736
But Comrade,

468
00:39:58,111 --> 00:40:00,113
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:05,661
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:19,925
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,266
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,245
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:52,040
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:55,752
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,838
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,090
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,259
what matters is

478
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,428
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:08,098
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:10,267
All right. I think it's time

481
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:12,853
to clink our glasses.

482
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:22,988
Not just this time

483
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:27,909
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:31,413
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:33,749
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:40,422
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:45,093
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:52,851
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,853
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:58,482
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:41:58,565 --> 00:41:59,441
Right?

492
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,867
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:42:14,372 --> 00:42:18,460
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,393
Why the hell

495
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:37,938
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:41,983
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:44,111
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,988
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:48,990
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:52,994
What is wrong with you?

501
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:57,791
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:02,045
What?

503
00:43:07,592 --> 00:43:08,969
I understand.

504
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:11,346
I get what you mean.

505
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,434
If we lose this election,

506
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,436
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,814
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:26,278
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:28,780
This is just an insurance.

510
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:32,617
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:35,203
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:36,872
All of us.

513
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,673
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:50,844
The vault?

515
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:57,142
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:00,770
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:07,903
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,085
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:28,506
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,466
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,385
Let me join you often.

522
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,971
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:37,682
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:44,856
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,111
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:51,529
No?

527
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,991
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:59,496
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:00,789
Stop it.

530
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:05,043
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,588
What is that about?

532
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:16,972
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:20,308
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,602
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,107
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,984
I should pay attention to.

537
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,949
How could you say that?

538
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:38,702
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:45,750
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:47,752
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:50,005
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:52,007
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:54,592
So if your husband dies,

544
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,846
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:10,317
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,445
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:15,155
to become king

548
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:18,908
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:24,039
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:26,583
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:31,838
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:46,353
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,646
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,942
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:55,987
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:59,532
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:03,495 --> 00:47:04,704
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:08,375
My father's house.

559
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,251
Your father?

560
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,087
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,385
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:23,306
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:28,770
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:33,024
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:38,613
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:41,449
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,618
Cheers.

568
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:46,204
Goodness.

569
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,832
Yeong-ro…

570
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,626
Stop crying.

571
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,003
Stop.

572
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:08,518
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:12,522
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,441
big sisters to me.

575
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:20,864
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:30,415
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,293
I mean it.

578
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:46,681
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,934
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:52,061
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:58,610
I'll come visit you often.

<i>What do I do now?</i>

584
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,427
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

585
00:49:28,306 --> 00:49:30,016
<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,937

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:44,317
It's been a while.

605
00:51:46,986 --> 00:51:48,696
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:10,134
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,429
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:16,933
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,477
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,106
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:29,779
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:32,407
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:36,411
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:38,871
from Austria myself.

615
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:57,098
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,396
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:05,732
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:08,776
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,114
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:15,032
And once they do,

621
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:18,578
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:26,586
As I told you many times,

623
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,047
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:53:32,216 --> 00:53:36,304
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,390
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,273
Your son…

627
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:52,028
misses his father so much,

628
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,988
Professor Han.

629
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:05,249
TAXI

630
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:08,127
Let's go.

631
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:46,624
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:48,292
Hey, driver!

633
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,919
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:02,557
Hey!

635
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:16,612
Damn it!

636
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:19,282
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:20,825
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:21,951
"Move"?

639
00:55:22,034 --> 00:55:26,205
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,168
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:33,504
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:34,964
I lost them.

643
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:36,757
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:38,426
How will you compensate?

645
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:40,928
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:44,181
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:46,475
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,185
This is Galaxy.

649
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,646
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:04,952
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:18,966
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,345
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:56:23,804 --> 00:56:27,516
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:30,519
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:34,065
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:56:34,231 --> 00:56:36,400
I must succeed.

657
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:39,487
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,412
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:53,042
I'll be discreet

660
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:56,128
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:56:56,754 --> 00:56:57,964
Let him go.

662
00:56:58,589 --> 00:56:59,507
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:04,220
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,265
Sir!

665
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:12,186
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,356
If we can decipher--

667
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,550
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,927
What does it mean?

669
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:48,347
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:52,685
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:57:53,352 --> 00:57:54,353
What are you doing?

672
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:11,746
Professor.

673
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,376
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:20,129
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,423
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:58:22,506 --> 00:58:25,509
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:27,053
Go to the North

678
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:30,222
and get out of there with him.

679
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:37,730
What?

680
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,024
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,818
safely and in secret

682
00:58:44,612 --> 00:58:46,405
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,338
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,258
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:10,638
that if you do what the North wants,

686
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,933
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:18,395
I'll give you my word.

688
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,274
Get some rest here.

689
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:45,339
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
00:59:46,173 --> 00:59:47,925
Are you not coming with us?

691
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:51,595
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:54,098
Tonight at 22:00,

693
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:57,518
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
00:59:57,601 --> 00:59:59,145
So I'll be there before then.

695
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,774
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:03,858 --> 01:00:06,527
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,822
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:13,826
to kill him.

699
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:24,837
If we don't get this done,

700
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,091
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,970
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:34,597
Understood?

703
01:00:35,723 --> 01:00:38,309
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

704
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:46,275
COSMOS TOYS

"Hosu Women's University… Dormitory…"

01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:43,249
"I've been searched.

A high risk of exposure.

Hoping to go to the North

709
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:51,465
as soon as possible."

710
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,301
So it was the dorm.

711
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:56,887
Let's go.

712
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,704
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:04,288 --> 01:03:07,750
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,544
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:03:11,628 --> 01:03:14,006
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,967
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,679
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:25,893
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,478
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:30,731
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:03:30,814 --> 01:03:34,068
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:37,529
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:51,043
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,253
It's nothing.

725
01:03:53,337 --> 01:03:55,089
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:59,843
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,557
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:04:10,104 --> 01:04:13,690
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:04:13,774 --> 01:04:16,068
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:52,688
Hello?

731
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:55,023
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:57,401
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:04:57,484 --> 01:05:00,571
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:05,909
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:08,203
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,264
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:06:10,015 --> 01:06:11,934
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:18,607
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:06:22,402 --> 01:06:23,487
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:25,781
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:12,054
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:13,430
you and Dong-jae

743
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:15,641
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,808
Yes, sir.

745
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,226
We need to capture him.

746
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,437
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:08:21,605 --> 01:08:23,273
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:09:00,602 --> 01:09:03,021
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,565
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,776
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:09:09,653 --> 01:09:11,071
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:09:11,154 --> 01:09:13,657
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,243
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:17,411
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:19,162
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:21,498
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:09:21,581 --> 01:09:24,042
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,003
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:29,464
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:30,924
looked so handsome.

761
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:33,969
And he asked me out!

762
01:09:48,442 --> 01:09:51,653
Yeong-ro!

763
01:09:53,697 --> 01:09:55,282
Yeong-ro…

764
01:09:58,452 --> 01:09:59,995
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:10:00,871 --> 01:10:02,122
Don't cry.

766
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:43,497
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,415
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:10:45,499 --> 01:10:48,126
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:10:58,136 --> 01:10:59,471
Hey!

770
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:02,349
What a pervert.

771
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:05,185
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:05,268 --> 01:11:06,770
That punk.

773
01:11:06,853 --> 01:11:09,689
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:11:11,525 --> 01:11:14,611
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:11:14,694 --> 01:11:17,322
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:20,700
Where are you going?

777
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:24,204
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:27,833
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:33,004
God damn it!

780
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:37,050
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:38,426
Are they after me?

782
01:11:40,804 --> 01:11:42,138
What's going on?

783
01:11:46,518 --> 01:11:48,228
I can't get caught.

784
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:58,446
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:04,369
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,873
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:12:15,922 --> 01:12:20,010
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,720
Darn it!

789
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:24,222
God, my hips.

790
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:35,400
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:12:36,443 --> 01:12:39,321
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:27,535
They must be near here.

793
01:13:27,619 --> 01:13:30,372
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:31,915
Everyone stand by.

795
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,252
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:13:36,336 --> 01:13:38,505
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:42,050
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,302
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:13:45,345 --> 01:13:47,639
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:49,975
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,018
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:54,771
Wait a minute.

803
01:13:54,854 --> 01:13:58,066
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,152
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:05,824
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:06,491 --> 01:14:07,575
Come here.

807
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:10,996
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:14:14,374 --> 01:14:15,834
My God.

809
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,874
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:57,917
Seol-hui.

811
01:14:59,044 --> 01:15:00,920
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,965
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:06,468
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:07,969
and…

815
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:14,517
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:18,146
Don't cry.

817
01:15:40,794 --> 01:15:44,964
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:47,258
Dad.

819
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:50,345
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:54,307
What's going on?

821
01:15:55,225 --> 01:15:57,018
What's going on?

822
01:15:57,102 --> 01:16:00,355
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,237
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,073
Hey, pal.

825
01:16:14,494 --> 01:16:15,703
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,628
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:16:44,524 --> 01:16:47,694
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,072
Hey.

829
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:54,242
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:55,994
Check upstairs.

831
01:19:14,007 --> 01:19:15,383
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:22,640
Drop the gun!

833
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,020
Stay away.

834
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,774
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:37,071
One.

836
01:19:39,032 --> 01:19:40,199
Two.

837
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:56,799
Three.

838
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:06,476
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:20:11,314 --> 01:20:13,232
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,735
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:18,905
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:22,492
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:20:22,575 --> 01:20:25,036
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:26,829
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:28,706
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,042
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,335
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,343
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,679
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,140
save a spy?

851
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,393
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,775
BONUS

853
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:22,802
Yeong-ro.

854
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:24,720
Everyone's ready.

855
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,729
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:21:35,356 --> 01:21:37,817
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,652
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:43,072
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:21:43,156 --> 01:21:45,741
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:21:45,825 --> 01:21:49,412
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
