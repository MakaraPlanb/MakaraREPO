EPISODE 4

3
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,720
But this is…

4
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:13,307
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:17,019
I think I can only leave…

6
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,607
without worrying about you

7
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,860
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:41,376
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,629
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:51,094
Just keep it.

11
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,724
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,026
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,486
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,405
They're going to miss him.

15
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,657
Damn it.

16
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:22,751
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,753
If you know who he really is--

18
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:28,048
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,805
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,725
My roommates

21
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,728
have been hiding him.

22
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,773
He came into our room,

23
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,900
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:51,196
Darn it.

25
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,656
You traitor!

26
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,418
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,297
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,967
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,685
Will you be okay?

30
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,771
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,231
Go now.

32
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,535
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,704
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,044
Hey!

36
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,807
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,643
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:06,188
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,522
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,901
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:11,902
Since what time?

42
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:15,072
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:18,033
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,302
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,762
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,807
Let's question him first.

47
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,104
I think

48
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,898
since the last time I was here,

49
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,401
I've been traumatized.

50
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,655
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:01,326
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,703
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:05,080
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:08,166
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,919
but you were wrong?

56
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,259
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,137
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,515
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:30,147
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,941
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,445
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,670
I'm suddenly

63
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,090
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,926
You might be on our side,

65
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,971
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,645
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:12,856
Which side are you on?

68
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,945
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,534
That hurts!

70
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,412
My ribs!

71
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,125
I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,628
Please don't kill me.

73
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,005
What did you do wrong?

74
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,052
Actually…

75
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,849
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,519
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,188
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,398
Gwang-tae.

79
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,028
Actually?

80
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,364
Actually what?

81
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,324
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,409
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:09,538
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,752
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,630
I'm so sorry.

86
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,521
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,439
Why are you so late?

88
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,526
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:41,403
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:45,949
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:51,288
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:30,535
Comrade.

93
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,670
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,549
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,636
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,888
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:55,477
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:09:58,438 --> 00:09:59,898
I should report first.

99
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:14,037
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,414
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,542
don't hesitate…

102
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,129
to kill him.

103
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,679
What happened?

104
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,766
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,768
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:39,020
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,652
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,739
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,866
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,495
Your face is well known now,

111
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:59,249
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,635
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:48,381
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:52,969
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,513
They're my brother's.

116
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:57,849
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,062
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:15,325
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,786
He was so hot!

120
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,038
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,499
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:24,542
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:27,504
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,088
He was so manly.

125
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:30,381
What's he majoring in?

126
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,300
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,470
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,889
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:40,391
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,993
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:04,207
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,629
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,885
Bun-ok.

134
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,514
We need to talk.

135
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,415
How long has it been?

136
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,085
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,344
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,848
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,187
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,065
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,610
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:17,655
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:20,199
I'm so sorry.

144
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:23,119
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:27,832
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,669
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,511
Did you call him first?

148
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,016
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:51,481
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,441
I ran into him.

151
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,735
At a record shop?

152
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:57,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,991
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:08,039
That bastard…

155
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,208
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,504
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,173
didn't you?

158
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:18,883
No. I never did.

159
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,551
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,522
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:36,275
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:40,530
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:50,748
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,959
Thanks.

165
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,857
Damn it.

172
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,639
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,394
That's right.

174
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,730
Maybe…

175
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:59,150
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,235
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,445
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,491
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,242
Hold on.

180
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:12,205
That means that guy is…

181
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,793
the spy?

182
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:24,133
Hold on.

183
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,095
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,138
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,265
She must be so mad.

186
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,309
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:36,020
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:40,316
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,693
Darn it.

190
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:45,446
Wait.

191
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,366
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,369
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:52,995
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:57,416
What if she finds it out?

195
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,419
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:02,421
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,299
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,968
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,428
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:11,097
That guy's gone.

201
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,182
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,769
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:18,104
Say good night.

204
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,772
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:45,298
Yeong-ro.

206
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,674
Yes?

207
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,801
Why are you so startled?

208
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,098
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,477
No, ma'am.

210
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,021
I didn't.

211
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,524
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:08,362
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:12,116
The open house is over.

214
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,910
Get it together,

215
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:16,162
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,079
Understood?

217
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:18,706
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,333
That'll be all.

219
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,417
Say good night.

220
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,682
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,268
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,646
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,235
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:48,819
Oh, that.

227
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,573
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:53,866
Right?

229
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,661
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,163
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,457
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,543
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:47,920
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:51,674
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,844
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,179
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:00,975
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,852
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,021
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:06,647
so get the money ready.

241
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,240
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,711
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,189
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:02,370
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,915
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,002
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:11,754
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:18,094
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:20,262
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,641
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:28,854
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:32,191
through social and economic means…

253
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:36,153
Hey, you.

254
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,239
No running.

255
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,085
God, I was so startled.

256
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:53,379
What's up?

257
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,676
My goodness. So they are

258
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,345
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,014
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,684
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,603
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,230
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:15,359
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,528
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,867
Thank you so much.

266
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,827
What's that now?

267
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:26,954
It's sweet potato!

268
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:29,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,376
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,211
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,839
All right.

272
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:42,011
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:43,637
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,557
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,058
I mean it.

276
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:49,810
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,188
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,105
Okay.

279
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:39,109
NO NAME

280
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,940
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:21,527
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,001
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:39,670
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:42,506
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,010
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,224
Take it.

287
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,935
What's all that?

288
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,187
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:25:57,605 --> 00:26:00,149
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:03,068
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:04,987
What's with the orchid?

292
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,286
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,331
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,171
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:36,060
I joined the ANSP

296
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:37,936
for only one reason.

297
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,404
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:51,784
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,331
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:26:57,831 --> 00:27:02,586
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,965
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:10,803
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:16,141
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,103
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:22,940
Why…

306
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,610
Why on earth…

307
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:42,084
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:46,422
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,382
So stay out of it.

310
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:49,800
Our agents?

311
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:53,137
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,681
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:17,202
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,544
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:30,507
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:33,969
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,110
Hello?

318
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:53,739
I called to ask you something.

319
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,160
You said

320
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:01,455
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,833
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,752
how much will I get?

323
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:10,547
The same amount?

324
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:16,762
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:19,223
Pardon?

326
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:21,433
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,560
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:27,147
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,738
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:36,907
What?

331
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:38,450
Turn in?

332
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:42,371
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,499
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:48,460
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,215
Come on.

336
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,008
Why are you going through that?

337
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:59,054
What's going on?

338
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,226
That's…

339
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:12,484
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,324
Well, this is…

341
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:23,620
I mean,

342
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:27,082
what happened is that…

343
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:29,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,005
Thank you for everything.

345
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:36,717
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,012
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,141
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,810
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:49,021
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:51,815
Oh, no.

351
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:55,569
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:58,822
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:00,908
My goodness.

354
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,683
The guy they hid

355
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:29,853
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:35,067
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:40,364
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:44,952
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:49,957
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,794
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:56,254
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:57,923
That's our duty.

363
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:00,550
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:04,513
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:10,185
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,648
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,609
I mean,

368
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:21,238
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:28,662
I am not.

370
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,331
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:35,377
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:37,838
50 million won?

373
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:42,509
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:45,053
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:48,390
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,442
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,653
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,370
If you understood,

379
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,499
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,252
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:03,965
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:06,384
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:08,553
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:10,472
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,433
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,852
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:19,397
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,733
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,861
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:27,781
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,783
No, they can easily make

392
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,410
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:43,797
Room 207.

394
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:48,093
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,681
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:56,101
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:59,312
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:02,858
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:04,192
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,778
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,119
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:17,330
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:29,217
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,927
I'll leave instead.

405
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,220
I helped him too--

406
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:33,597
Of course,

407
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:36,808
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:43,899
But…

409
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:47,152
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:51,531
He was

411
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:54,284
your partner, right?

412
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,543
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:07,130
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:15,680
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:19,142
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:21,770
From this moment on,

417
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:25,190
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:26,858
Pardon?

419
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,777
Even a phone call?

420
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,072
Get out!

421
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,133
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:56,638
Did you see it?

423
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,973
Did you?

424
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:00,642
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,310
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:05,897
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,774
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:12,529
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:22,330
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:25,250
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:31,965
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:35,677
Stop.

433
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,845
Let's go.

434
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,638
What's her problem?

435
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,432
You crazy b****!

436
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:41,766
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,186
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,188
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,899
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,343
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,472
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,102
Let's go.

443
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:31,608
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:35,153
My wound's been healed.

445
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:38,239
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:40,617
I'm relieved.

447
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:45,038
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,708
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,960
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:54,798
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,801
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,469
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,180
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:04,432
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,434
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:09,604
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:12,273
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:17,445
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,072
Don't forget that.

460
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,074
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:25,286
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:39:39,592 --> 00:39:41,261
What did I tell you?

463
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:44,722
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:46,474
In any case,

465
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,102
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:56,317
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:58,236
But Comrade,

468
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:00,613
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:06,161
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:20,425
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,766
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:48,745
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:52,540
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:56,252
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:58,338
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,590
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,759
what matters is

478
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,928
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:08,598
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,767
All right. I think it's time

481
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:13,353
to clink our glasses.

482
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,488
Not just this time

483
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:28,409
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,913
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:34,249
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:40,922
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:45,593
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,351
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,353
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:58,982
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:41:59,065 --> 00:41:59,941
Right?

492
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,367
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:18,960
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:35,893
Why the hell

495
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,438
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:42,483
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,611
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,488
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:49,490
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,494
What is wrong with you?

501
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:58,291
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,545
What?

503
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:09,469
I understand.

504
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:11,846
I get what you mean.

505
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:16,934
If we lose this election,

506
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:18,936
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,314
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:26,778
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:29,280
This is just an insurance.

510
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:33,117
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:35,703
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:37,372
All of us.

513
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:47,173
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:51,344
The vault?

515
00:43:56,015 --> 00:43:57,642
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:43:57,725 --> 00:44:01,270
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:08,403
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,585
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:29,006
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:29,966
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,885
Let me join you often.

522
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,471
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:44:36,222 --> 00:44:38,182
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:45,356
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:50,611
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:52,029
No?

527
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,491
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:59,996
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,289
Stop it.

530
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:05,543
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:09,088
What is that about?

532
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:17,472
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:20,808
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:23,102
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,607
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,484
I should pay attention to.

537
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:36,449
How could you say that?

538
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:39,202
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:45:43,122 --> 00:45:46,250
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:48,252
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:50,505
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:52,507
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:55,092
So if your husband dies,

544
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,346
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:10,817
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,945
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,655
to become king

548
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:19,408
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:24,539
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:27,083
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:32,338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:46,853
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,146
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:53,442
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:56,487
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:46:56,571 --> 00:47:00,032
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:05,204
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:08,875
My father's house.

559
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:10,751
Your father?

560
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:12,587
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:18,885
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:23,806
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:29,270
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:47:31,063 --> 00:47:33,524
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:39,113
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:41,949
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,118
Cheers.

568
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:46,704
Goodness.

569
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:49,332
Yeong-ro…

570
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,126
Stop crying.

571
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:54,503
Stop.

572
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:09,018
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:09,894 --> 00:48:13,022
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,941
big sisters to me.

575
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:21,364
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:30,915
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:33,793
I mean it.

578
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:47,181
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,434
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:52,561
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:59,110
I'll come visit you often.

584
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,927
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

585

<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:34,437

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:44,817
It's been a while.

605
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,196
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:10,634
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,929
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:17,433
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,977
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,606
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:30,279
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:32,907
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:36,911
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:52:37,995 --> 00:52:39,371
from Austria myself.

615
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:57,598
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,896
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:06,232
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:09,276
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,614
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:15,532
And once they do,

621
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:19,078
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:27,086
As I told you many times,

623
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:30,547
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:53:32,716 --> 00:53:36,804
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:39,890
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,773
Your son…

627
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:52,528
misses his father so much,

628
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:54,488
Professor Han.

629
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:05,749
TAXI

630
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:08,627
Let's go.

631
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:47,124
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:48,792
Hey, driver!

633
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:50,419
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:03,057
Hey!

635
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,112
Damn it!

636
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:19,782
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:21,325
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:22,451
"Move"?

639
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:26,705
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,668
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:34,004
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:35,464
I lost them.

643
00:55:35,547 --> 00:55:37,257
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:55:37,341 --> 00:55:38,926
How will you compensate?

645
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:41,428
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,681
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:46,975
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,685
This is Galaxy.

649
00:55:49,228 --> 00:55:51,146
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:05,452
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,466
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,845
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:28,016
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:31,019
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:34,565
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:36,900
I must succeed.

657
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,987
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,912
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:56:52,082 --> 00:56:53,542
I'll be discreet

660
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:56,628
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:56:57,254 --> 00:56:58,464
Let him go.

662
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:00,007
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,720
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:08,765
Sir!

665
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:12,686
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:15,856
If we can decipher--

667
00:57:40,923 --> 00:57:43,050
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:57:43,926 --> 00:57:45,427
What does it mean?

669
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:48,847
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:53,185
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:54,853
What are you doing?

672
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:12,246
Professor.

673
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,876
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:20,629
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,923
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:58:23,006 --> 00:58:26,009
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:58:26,093 --> 00:58:27,553
Go to the North

678
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,722
and get out of there with him.

679
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:38,230
What?

680
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:40,524
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:43,318
safely and in secret

682
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:46,905
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:02,838
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:06,758
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,138
that if you do what the North wants,

686
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:14,433
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:18,895
I'll give you my word.

688
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:22,774
Get some rest here.

689
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:45,839
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
00:59:46,673 --> 00:59:48,425
Are you not coming with us?

691
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:52,095
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:54,598
Tonight at 22:00,

693
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,018
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,645
So I'll be there before then.

695
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,274
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,027
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:10,322
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:14,326
to kill him.

699
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:25,337
If we don't get this done,

700
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:29,591
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,470
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:35,097
Understood?

703
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,809
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

Hoping to go to the North

01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:51,965
as soon as possible."

710
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,801
So it was the dorm.

711
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:57,387
Let's go.

712
01:03:01,993 --> 01:03:04,204
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:08,250
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:11,044
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:14,506
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:17,467
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:21,179
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:26,393
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:27,978
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:03:28,061 --> 01:03:31,231
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:03:31,314 --> 01:03:34,568
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:03:35,318 --> 01:03:38,029
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:51,543
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,753
It's nothing.

725
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:55,589
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:03:56,631 --> 01:04:00,343
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,057
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:14,190
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:16,568
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,188
Hello?

731
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:55,523
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:04:55,607 --> 01:04:57,901
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:04:57,984 --> 01:05:01,071
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:06,409
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:06,493 --> 01:05:08,703
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:09,764
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:12,434
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:06:16,396 --> 01:06:19,107
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:06:22,902 --> 01:06:23,987
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:26,281
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:12,554
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:13,930
you and Dong-jae

743
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:16,141
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,308
Yes, sir.

745
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:18,726
We need to capture him.

746
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,937
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:08:22,105 --> 01:08:23,773
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:09:01,102 --> 01:09:03,521
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:06,065
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:08,276
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:09:10,153 --> 01:09:11,571
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:14,157
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,743
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:09:16,826 --> 01:09:17,911
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:09:17,994 --> 01:09:19,662
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:21,998
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:24,542
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:27,503
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:09:27,587 --> 01:09:29,964
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:09:30,048 --> 01:09:31,424
looked so handsome.

761
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:34,469
And he asked me out!

762
01:09:48,942 --> 01:09:52,153
Yeong-ro!

763
01:09:54,197 --> 01:09:55,782
Yeong-ro…

764
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:00,495
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,622
Don't cry.

766
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:43,997
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,915
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,626
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:10:58,636 --> 01:10:59,971
Hey!

770
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:02,849
What a pervert.

771
01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:05,685
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:05,768 --> 01:11:07,270
That punk.

773
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:10,189
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:11:12,025 --> 01:11:15,111
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:17,822
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:21,200
Where are you going?

777
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:24,704
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:28,333
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:33,504
God damn it!

780
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:37,550
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:38,926
Are they after me?

782
01:11:41,304 --> 01:11:42,638
What's going on?

783
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,728
I can't get caught.

784
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:58,946
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:02,825 --> 01:12:04,869
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:08,373
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:20,510
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,220
Darn it!

789
01:12:22,929 --> 01:12:24,722
God, my hips.

790
01:12:32,146 --> 01:12:35,900
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:39,821
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:13:26,742 --> 01:13:28,035
They must be near here.

793
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:30,872
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:13:30,955 --> 01:13:32,415
Everyone stand by.

795
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:36,752
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:39,005
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:13:40,131 --> 01:13:42,550
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:44,802
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:48,139
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:50,475
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:52,518
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:55,271
Wait a minute.

803
01:13:55,354 --> 01:13:58,566
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:01,652
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:02,987 --> 01:14:06,324
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:08,075
Come here.

807
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:11,496
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:16,334
My God.

809
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:56,374
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:58,417
Seol-hui.

811
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:01,420
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:04,465
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:04,549 --> 01:15:06,968
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:07,552 --> 01:15:08,469
and…

815
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:15,017
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:15:16,727 --> 01:15:18,646
Don't cry.

817
01:15:41,294 --> 01:15:45,464
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:47,758
Dad.

819
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:50,845
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:15:53,431 --> 01:15:54,807
What's going on?

821
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:57,518
What's going on?

822
01:15:57,602 --> 01:16:00,855
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:07,737
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:08,696 --> 01:16:10,573
Hey, pal.

825
01:16:14,994 --> 01:16:16,203
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:24,128
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:16:45,024 --> 01:16:48,194
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:51,572
Hey.

829
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,742
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:56,494
Check upstairs.

831
01:19:14,507 --> 01:19:15,883
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:19:21,597 --> 01:19:23,140
Drop the gun!

833
01:19:26,393 --> 01:19:27,520
Stay away.

834
01:19:30,189 --> 01:19:32,274
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,571
One.

836
01:19:39,532 --> 01:19:40,699
Two.

837
01:19:55,798 --> 01:19:57,299
Three.

838
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,976
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:20:11,814 --> 01:20:13,732
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,235
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:20:16,819 --> 01:20:19,405
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:20:19,488 --> 01:20:22,992
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:20:23,075 --> 01:20:25,536
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:27,329
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:29,206
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:31,542
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:32,835
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:40,843
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:44,179
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:46,640
save a spy?

851
01:20:47,308 --> 01:20:48,893
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,275
BONUS

853
01:21:22,426 --> 01:21:23,302
Yeong-ro.

854
01:21:24,053 --> 01:21:25,220
Everyone's ready.

855
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:34,229
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,317
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,152
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:21:41,403 --> 01:21:43,572
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:21:43,656 --> 01:21:46,241
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:49,912
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
