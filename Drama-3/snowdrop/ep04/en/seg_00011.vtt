00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.004 line:85.83%,end
Are you listening? You can't leave!

00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:24.464 line:85.83%,end
I lost them.

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.257 line:85.83%,end
Kill me first if you want to leave.

00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:27.926 line:85.83%,end
How will you compensate?

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.428 line:85.83%,end
-How?
-My goodness.

00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.681 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:35.975 line:85.83%,end
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.685 line:85.83%,end
This is Galaxy.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.146 line:85.83%,end
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:54.452 line:85.83%,end
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:08.466 line:85.83%,end
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.845 line:85.83%,end
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

00:57:13.304 --> 00:57:17.016 line:85.83%,end
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

00:57:18.184 --> 00:57:20.019 line:85.83%,end
I grew up with a single mom.

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:23.565 line:85.83%,end
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

00:57:23.731 --> 00:57:25.900 line:85.83%,end
I must succeed.

00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:28.987 line:85.83%,end
So why would I help a communist?

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.912 line:85.83%,end
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:42.542 line:85.83%,end
I'll be discreet

00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:45.628 line:85.83%,end
and make sure to get the job done.

00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.464 line:85.83%,end
Let him go.

00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:49.007 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:57:50.175 --> 00:57:53.720 line:85.83%,end
I'll return your kindness one day!

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.765 line:85.83%,end
Sir!

00:57:58.224 --> 00:58:01.686 line:85.83%,end
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:04.856 line:85.83%,end
If we can decipher--

00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:32.050 line:85.83%,end
He moved to some quiet suburb.

00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:34.427 line:85.83%,end
What does it mean?

00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:37.847 line:85.83%,end
"The scenery is so beautiful

00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:42.185 line:85.83%,end
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:43.853 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

00:58:59.994 --> 00:59:01.246 line:85.83%,end
Professor.

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.876 line:85.83%,end
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

00:59:07.669 --> 00:59:09.629 line:85.83%,end
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.923 line:85.83%,end
he's been trying to escape.

00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:15.009 line:85.83%,end
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:16.553 line:85.83%,end
Go to the North

00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:19.722 line:85.83%,end
and get out of there with him.

00:59:26.312 --> 00:59:27.230 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:59:27.313 --> 00:59:29.524 line:85.83%,end
We'll help you get out with him

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.318 line:85.83%,end
safely and in secret

00:59:34.112 --> 00:59:35.905 line:85.83%,end
before the CIA finds it out.

00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.838 line:85.83%,end
What do I have to do in return?

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.758 line:85.83%,end
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.138 line:85.83%,end
that if you do what the North wants,

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:03.433 line:85.83%,end
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:07.895 line:85.83%,end
I'll give you my word.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.774 line:85.83%,end
Get some rest here.

01:00:32.253 --> 01:00:34.839 line:85.83%,end
You guys go first with Professor Han.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.425 line:85.83%,end
Are you not coming with us?

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:41.095 line:85.83%,end
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:43.598 line:85.83%,end
Tonight at 22:00,

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.018 line:85.83%,end
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:48.645 line:85.83%,end
So I'll be there before then.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.274 line:85.83%,end
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:56.027 line:85.83%,end
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.322 line:85.83%,end
<i>don't hesitateâ€¦</i>

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.326 line:85.83%,end
to kill him.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:14.337 line:85.83%,end
If we don't get this done,

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:18.591 line:85.83%,end
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.470 line:85.83%,end
We must accomplish the mission.
