00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:08.324 line:85.83%,end
Well, this is…

00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:12.620 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:16.082 line:85.83%,end
what happened is that…

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.001 line:85.83%,end
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.005 line:85.83%,end
Thank you for everything.

00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:25.717 line:85.83%,end
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.012 line:85.83%,end
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:33.141 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.810 line:85.83%,end
I was so thoughtless.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:38.021 line:85.83%,end
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:40.815 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no.

00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:44.569 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:47.822 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.908 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.683 line:85.83%,end
The guy they hid

00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:18.853 line:85.83%,end
isn't a spy but a student protester.

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:24.067 line:85.83%,end
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:29.364 line:85.83%,end
Fine. Let's say he is.

00:32:30.698 --> 00:32:33.952 line:85.83%,end
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:38.957 line:85.83%,end
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.794 line:85.83%,end
I'm not doing this for money.

00:32:42.877 --> 00:32:45.254 line:85.83%,end
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.923 line:85.83%,end
That's our duty.

00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:49.550 line:85.83%,end
Duty? So what if you do?

00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:53.513 line:85.83%,end
You think they won't question you?

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:59.185 line:85.83%,end
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.648 line:85.83%,end
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.609 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.238 line:85.83%,end
you're a communist's sister.

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.662 line:85.83%,end
I am not.

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:20.331 line:85.83%,end
My sister is not a Northern spy!

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:24.377 line:85.83%,end
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.838 line:85.83%,end
50 million won?

00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:31.509 line:85.83%,end
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.053 line:85.83%,end
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:37.390 line:85.83%,end
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.442 line:85.83%,end
If it weren't for my old teacher,

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.653 line:85.83%,end
I'd have never hired you.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.370 line:85.83%,end
If you understood,

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.499 line:85.83%,end
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:48.252 line:85.83%,end
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:52.965 line:85.83%,end
It's all my fault.

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:55.384 line:85.83%,end
I begged them to hide him.

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:57.553 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:59.472 line:85.83%,end
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:02.433 line:85.83%,end
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.852 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't ignore him.

00:35:06.062 --> 00:35:08.397 line:85.83%,end
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.733 line:85.83%,end
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:13.861 line:85.83%,end
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:16.781 line:85.83%,end
They can easily make you guys spies.

00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:18.783 line:85.83%,end
No, they can easily make

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:21.410 line:85.83%,end
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:32.797 line:85.83%,end
Room 207.

00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:37.093 line:85.83%,end
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:41.681 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:45.101 line:85.83%,end
They all told me we should call the cops,

00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:48.312 line:85.83%,end
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:51.858 line:85.83%,end
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:53.192 line:85.83%,end
Please let me be punished.

00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:55.778 line:85.83%,end
Please let me be solely responsible!

00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.119 line:85.83%,end
Fine, if you say so.

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:06.330 line:85.83%,end
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.
