00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:19.535 line:85.83%,end
Comrade.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.670 line:85.83%,end
Where's Geum-cheol?

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.549 line:85.83%,end
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.636 line:85.83%,end
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.888 line:85.83%,end
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.477 line:85.83%,end
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.898 line:85.83%,end
I should report first.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.037 line:85.83%,end
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.414 line:85.83%,end
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:08.542 line:85.83%,end
don't hesitate…

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.129 line:85.83%,end
to kill him.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.679 line:85.83%,end
What happened?

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.766 line:85.83%,end
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.768 line:85.83%,end
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:28.020 line:85.83%,end
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.652 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.739 line:85.83%,end
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.866 line:85.83%,end
It's not likely to succeed.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.495 line:85.83%,end
Your face is well known now,

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:48.249 line:85.83%,end
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.635 line:85.83%,end
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.381 line:85.83%,end
EUN YEONG-U

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.969 line:85.83%,end
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.513 line:85.83%,end
They're my brother's.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.849 line:85.83%,end
I wonder if they fit you.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.062 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you try them on?

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:04.325 line:85.83%,end
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:06.786 line:85.83%,end
He was so hot!

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.038 line:85.83%,end
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.499 line:85.83%,end
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.542 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.504 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.088 line:85.83%,end
He was so manly.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.381 line:85.83%,end
What's he majoring in?

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.300 line:85.83%,end
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:24.470 line:85.83%,end
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.889 line:85.83%,end
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.391 line:85.83%,end
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.993 line:85.83%,end
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:53.207 line:85.83%,end
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.629 line:14.17%,start
EUN YEONG-RO'S

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:04.885 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:08.514 line:85.83%,end
We need to talk.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.415 line:85.83%,end
How long has it been?

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:38.085 line:85.83%,end
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.344 line:85.83%,end
You must've been mocking me.

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:50.848 line:85.83%,end
I don't follow you.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.187 line:85.83%,end
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.065 line:85.83%,end
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.610 line:85.83%,end
and told me to come because he missed me,

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:06.655 line:85.83%,end
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.199 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.119 line:85.83%,end
You must've looked down on me so much

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.832 line:85.83%,end
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.669 line:85.83%,end
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!
