00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.484 line:85.83%,end
I should pay attention to.

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:25.449 line:85.83%,end
How could you say that?

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:28.202 line:85.83%,end
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:35.250 line:85.83%,end
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:37.252 line:85.83%,end
Unless war breaks out,

00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.505 line:85.83%,end
you can't kill 13 virgins.

00:46:39.588 --> 00:46:41.507 line:85.83%,end
Besides, this is your second marriage.

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:44.092 line:85.83%,end
So if your husband dies,

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.346 line:85.83%,end
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:59.817 line:85.83%,end
Your future is whatever you make it.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.945 line:85.83%,end
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:04.655 line:85.83%,end
to become king

00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:08.408 line:85.83%,end
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:13.539 line:85.83%,end
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:16.083 line:85.83%,end
Your future is whatever you make it.

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:21.338 line:85.83%,end
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:47:33.892 --> 00:47:35.853 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.146 line:85.83%,end
that you have to leave while we stay.

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:42.442 line:85.83%,end
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:45.487 line:85.83%,end
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:49.032 line:85.83%,end
Have you decided where to go?

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:54.204 line:85.83%,end
Your cousin's house?

00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:57.875 line:85.83%,end
My father's house.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:47:59.751 line:85.83%,end
Your father?

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:01.587 line:85.83%,end
Your father lives in Seoul?

00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:07.885 line:85.83%,end
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:12.806 line:85.83%,end
he married this really annoying woman.

00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:18.270 line:85.83%,end
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:22.524 line:85.83%,end
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:28.113 line:85.83%,end
Come on. I'm all right.

00:48:28.196 --> 00:48:30.949 line:85.83%,end
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:33.118 line:85.83%,end
Cheers.

00:48:34.286 --> 00:48:35.704 line:85.83%,end
Goodness.

00:48:36.496 --> 00:48:38.332 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro…

00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.126 line:85.83%,end
Stop crying.

00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:43.503 line:85.83%,end
Stop.

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:58.018 line:85.83%,end
Since I moved into the dorm,

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:02.022 line:85.83%,end
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.941 line:85.83%,end
big sisters to me.

00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:10.364 line:85.83%,end
I have been really happy
living here with you.

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:19.915 line:85.83%,end
Thank you guys so much for everything.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.793 line:85.83%,end
I mean it.

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:36.181 line:85.83%,end
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:39.434 line:85.83%,end
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.561 line:85.83%,end
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:48.110 line:85.83%,end

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.927 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.516 line:85.83%,end
