It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:33.817 line:85.83%,end
It's been a while.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.196 line:85.83%,end
Professor Han I-seop.

00:52:55.255 --> 00:52:59.634 line:85.83%,end
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.929 line:85.83%,end
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:06.433 line:85.83%,end
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.977 line:85.83%,end
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.606 line:85.83%,end
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:19.279 line:85.83%,end
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:21.907 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure you looked into it.

00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:25.911 line:85.83%,end
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:28.371 line:85.83%,end
from Austria myself.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.598 line:85.83%,end
I can show you a letter your son sent.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.896 line:85.83%,end
Min-jae sent a letter?

00:53:52.979 --> 00:53:55.232 line:85.83%,end
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:58.276 line:85.83%,end
that your son is in Pyongyang.

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:02.614 line:85.83%,end
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.532 line:85.83%,end
And once they do,

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:08.078 line:85.83%,end
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:16.086 line:85.83%,end
As I told you many times,

00:54:17.337 --> 00:54:19.547 line:85.83%,end
your son willingly went to the North.

00:54:21.716 --> 00:54:25.804 line:85.83%,end
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:28.890 line:85.83%,end
for your sake, Professor.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.773 line:85.83%,end
Your sonâ€¦

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.528 line:85.83%,end
misses his father so much,

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:43.488 line:85.83%,end
Professor Han.

00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:54.749 line:85.83%,end
TAXI

00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:57.627 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:36.124 line:85.83%,end
What? Why are you taking this route?

00:55:36.207 --> 00:55:37.792 line:85.83%,end
Hey, driver!

00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:39.419 line:85.83%,end
Hey, driver!

00:55:51.056 --> 00:55:52.057 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:06.112 line:85.83%,end
Damn it!

00:56:06.738 --> 00:56:08.782 line:85.83%,end
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.325 line:85.83%,end
-What the hell?
-Move!

00:56:10.408 --> 00:56:11.451 line:85.83%,end
"Move"?

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:15.705 line:85.83%,end
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.668 line:85.83%,end
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?
