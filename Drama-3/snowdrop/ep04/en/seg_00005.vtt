There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:31.506 line:85.83%,end
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.010 line:85.83%,end
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.224 line:85.83%,end
Take it.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.935 line:85.83%,end
What's all that?

00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:46.187 line:85.83%,end
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:49.149 line:85.83%,end
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:52.068 line:85.83%,end
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:53.987 line:85.83%,end
What's with the orchid?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.286 line:85.83%,end
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.331 line:85.83%,end
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.171 line:85.83%,end
I thought you were out of my team.

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:25.060 line:85.83%,end
I joined the ANSP

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:26.936 line:85.83%,end
for only one reason.

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:36.404 line:85.83%,end
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:40.784 line:85.83%,end
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:46.331 line:85.83%,end
I only joined to ask him why.

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:51.586 line:85.83%,end
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:55.965 line:85.83%,end
waiting for him for six years.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:59.803 line:85.83%,end
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:05.141 line:85.83%,end
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.103 line:85.83%,end
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:11.940 line:85.83%,end
Why…

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:15.610 line:85.83%,end
Why on earth…

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.084 line:85.83%,end
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.422 line:85.83%,end
I had our agents tail him closely.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.382 line:85.83%,end
So stay out of it.

00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:38.800 line:85.83%,end
Our agents?

00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:42.137 line:85.83%,end
You think they're loyal to you?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.681 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:06.202 line:85.83%,end
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:14.544 line:85.83%,end
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:19.507 line:85.83%,end
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.969 line:85.83%,end
She's so generous, isn't she?

00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:39.110 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:42.739 line:85.83%,end
I called to ask you something.

00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.160 line:85.83%,end
You said

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:50.455 line:85.83%,end
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:53.833 line:85.83%,end
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.752 line:85.83%,end
how much will I get?

00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:59.547 line:85.83%,end
The same amount?

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.762 line:85.83%,end
Why are you curious about that?

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.223 line:85.83%,end
Pardon?

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.433 line:85.83%,end
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.560 line:85.83%,end
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:16.147 line:85.83%,end
Gye Bun-ok.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.738 line:85.83%,end
Because I'll turn someone in.

00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:25.907 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:27.450 line:85.83%,end
Turn in?

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:31.371 line:85.83%,end
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.499 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:37.460 line:85.83%,end
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.215 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.008 line:85.83%,end
Why are you going through that?

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.054 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:53.226 line:85.83%,end
That's…

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.484 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.
