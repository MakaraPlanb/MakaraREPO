You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:06.822 line:85.83%,end
And what's that look, you jerk?

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.200 line:85.83%,end
Where are you going?

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.704 line:85.83%,end
You bastard. Come here.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.333 line:85.83%,end
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:22.504 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:26.550 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:27.926 line:85.83%,end
Are they after me?

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:31.638 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.728 line:85.83%,end
I can't get caught.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:47.946 line:85.83%,end
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:53.869 line:85.83%,end
That hurt. Damn it.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.373 line:85.83%,end
Okay. I must get in here.

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:09.510 line:85.83%,end
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.220 line:85.83%,end
Darn it!

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:13.722 line:85.83%,end
God, my hips.

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:24.900 line:85.83%,end
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:28.821 line:85.83%,end
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:17.035 line:85.83%,end
They must be near here.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.872 line:85.83%,end
So call for backup and stand by here.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.415 line:85.83%,end
Everyone stand by.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.752 line:85.83%,end
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:28.005 line:85.83%,end
Are they really here for my organs?

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.550 line:85.83%,end
Those bastards. There's some time left.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.802 line:85.83%,end
Those cold-hearted bastards.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.139 line:85.83%,end
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:39.475 line:85.83%,end
Maybe they're after this pervert.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.518 line:85.83%,end
Hey, what's your deal?

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:44.271 line:85.83%,end
Wait a minute.

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:47.566 line:85.83%,end
How dare you follow me in here?

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.652 line:85.83%,end
Did you just hit me?

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:55.324 line:85.83%,end
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.075 line:85.83%,end
Come here.

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:00.496 line:85.83%,end
I'll teach you a lesson.

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:05.334 line:85.83%,end
My God.

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:45.374 line:85.83%,end
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.417 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.420 line:85.83%,end
I didn't tell them anything.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.465 line:85.83%,end
To protect you, Seol-hui,

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.968 line:85.83%,end
I endured all sorts of torturing

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:57.469 line:85.83%,end
andâ€¦

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.017 line:85.83%,end
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.646 line:85.83%,end
Don't cry.

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:34.464 line:85.83%,end
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:36.758 line:85.83%,end
Dad.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.845 line:85.83%,end
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.807 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.518 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.855 line:85.83%,end
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:56.737 line:85.83%,end
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.573 line:85.83%,end
Hey, pal.
