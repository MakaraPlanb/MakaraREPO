"Hosu Women's University… Dormitory…"

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:32.749 line:85.83%,end
"I've been searched.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.543 line:85.83%,end
A high risk of exposure.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.296 line:85.83%,end
Hoping to go to the North

01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:40.965 line:85.83%,end
as soon as possible."

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.801 line:85.83%,end
So it was the dorm.

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:46.387 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.204 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:57.250 line:85.83%,end
What? On the phone?

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.044 line:85.83%,end
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:03.506 line:85.83%,end
Oh, that? It was my friend.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.467 line:85.83%,end
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:10.179 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:15.393 line:85.83%,end
By the way, how will she move all this?

01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:16.978 line:85.83%,end
I called Byeong-tae.

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:20.231 line:85.83%,end
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:23.568 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:27.029 line:85.83%,end
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.543 line:85.83%,end
What's that? Where did you get it?

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.753 line:85.83%,end
It's nothing.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.589 line:85.83%,end
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:49.343 line:85.83%,end
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.057 line:85.83%,end
How could he? He's being chased.

<i>Room 207.</i>

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.568 line:85.83%,end
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.188 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:44.523 line:85.83%,end
I heard it from the hall director.

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.901 line:85.83%,end
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:50.071 line:85.83%,end
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.409 line:85.83%,end
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.703 line:85.83%,end
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.
