00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.511 line:85.83%,end
Did you call him first?

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.016 line:85.83%,end
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:40.481 line:85.83%,end
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.441 line:85.83%,end
I ran into him.

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.735 line:85.83%,end
At a record shop?

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.946 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:50.991 line:85.83%,end
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.039 line:85.83%,end
That bastard…

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.208 line:85.83%,end
He told me he had other plans.

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.504 line:85.83%,end
You told him I wasn't a college student,

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.173 line:85.83%,end
didn't you?

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.883 line:85.83%,end
No. I never did.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.551 line:85.83%,end
Why would I tell him that?

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.522 line:85.83%,end
Right. You did nothing wrong.

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:25.275 line:85.83%,end
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:29.530 line:85.83%,end
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.748 line:85.83%,end
I'll know my place from now on.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.959 line:85.83%,end
Thanks.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.857 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.028 line:85.83%,end
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM
OPEN HOUSE

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:12.072 line:85.83%,end
NO ONE WILL BE
ALLOWED IN WITHOUT INVITATION

00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:19.997 line:85.83%,end
OPEN HOUSE
GUEST LIST

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.417 line:85.83%,end
Room 207…

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.836 line:85.83%,end
Room 207…

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:30.215 line:85.83%,end
ROOM 207, EUN YEONG-RO

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.639 line:85.83%,end
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:42.394 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.730 line:85.83%,end
Maybe…

00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:48.150 line:85.83%,end
the spy is hiding in there.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.235 line:85.83%,end
Come on. I doubt that.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.445 line:85.83%,end
DO NOT ENTER

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:55.491 line:85.83%,end
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.242 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:01.205 line:85.83%,end
That means that guy is…

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:05.793 line:85.83%,end
the spy?

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.133 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:16.095 line:85.83%,end
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:18.138 line:85.83%,end
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.265 line:85.83%,end
She must be so mad.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.309 line:85.83%,end
The way Gizzard sees it,

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:25.020 line:85.83%,end
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.316 line:85.83%,end
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.693 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.446 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.366 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

00:18:38.325 --> 00:18:40.369 line:85.83%,end
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:41.995 line:85.83%,end
She'll find it suspicious.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.416 line:85.83%,end
What if she finds it out?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.419 line:85.83%,end
She'll never let it slide.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.421 line:85.83%,end
This is driving me crazy.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.299 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.968 line:85.83%,end
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.428 line:85.83%,end
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.097 line:85.83%,end
That guy's gone.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.182 line:85.83%,end
And there's no proof that we hid him.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.769 line:85.83%,end
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.104 line:85.83%,end
Say good night.

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.772 line:85.83%,end
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:34.298 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:35.674 line:85.83%,end
Yes?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.801 line:85.83%,end
Why are you so startled?

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.098 line:85.83%,end
Did you do something wrong?

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.477 line:85.83%,end
No, ma'am.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.021 line:85.83%,end
I didn't.

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.524 line:85.83%,end
Pull yourself together.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:57.362 line:85.83%,end
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:01.116 line:85.83%,end
The open house is over.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.910 line:85.83%,end
Get it together,

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.162 line:85.83%,end
or you might mess up your exam.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.079 line:85.83%,end
Understood?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.706 line:85.83%,end
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:09.333 line:85.83%,end
That'll be all.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.417 line:85.83%,end
Say good night.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.170 line:85.83%,end
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:25.682 line:85.83%,end
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:28.268 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure she found out.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.646 line:85.83%,end
And she's not the type to let it slide.
