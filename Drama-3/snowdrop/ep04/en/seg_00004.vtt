I'm sure she's up to something.

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.235 line:85.83%,end
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.819 line:85.83%,end
Oh, that.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.573 line:85.83%,end
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.866 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.661 line:85.83%,end
Where do you think is safest?

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.163 line:85.83%,end
It's me, son. How did it go?

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.457 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do you think?</i>

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.543 line:85.83%,end
I put my organs as collateral.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.920 line:85.83%,end
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

00:21:37.212 --> 00:21:40.674 line:85.83%,end
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.844 line:85.83%,end
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.179 line:85.83%,end
How could you say that to your father?

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:49.975 line:85.83%,end
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:51.852 line:85.83%,end
You and your nagging again!

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.021 line:85.83%,end
I'll go see you in two days,

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.647 line:85.83%,end
so get the money ready.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:05.240 line:85.83%,end
All right. I'm back with money.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.711 line:85.83%,end
Go back in. I'll be okay.

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:37.189 line:85.83%,end

00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:25.153 line:85.83%,end
Hey, you.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.239 line:85.83%,end
No running.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.085 line:85.83%,end
God, I was so startled.

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.379 line:85.83%,end
What's up?

00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:47.676 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. So they are

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.345 line:85.83%,end
the clothes that guy left behind?

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:53.014 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.684 line:85.83%,end
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:58.603 line:85.83%,end
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.230 line:85.83%,end
Sure, let's do that.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:04.359 line:85.83%,end
The hall director never comes down here,

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:06.528 line:85.83%,end
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:11.867 line:85.83%,end
Thank you so much.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.827 line:85.83%,end
What's that now?

00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:15.954 line:85.83%,end
It's sweet potato!

00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:18.331 line:85.83%,end
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.376 line:85.83%,end
I'll put it here, so have it later.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.211 line:85.83%,end
Okay. Thank you.

00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.839 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:31.011 line:85.83%,end
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:32.637 line:85.83%,end
He managed to get out safely,

00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.557 line:85.83%,end
and it's all thanks to you.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.058 line:85.83%,end
I mean it.

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.810 line:85.83%,end
Come on. I didn't do much.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:41.188 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry, and go back now.

00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:42.105 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:28.109 line:85.83%,end
NO NAME
