00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:18.217 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.927 line:85.83%,end
I'll leave instead.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.220 line:85.83%,end
I helped him too--

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:22.597 line:85.83%,end
Of course,

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.808 line:85.83%,end
she couldn't have done it by herself.

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:32.899 line:85.83%,end
Butâ€¦

00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:36.152 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:40.531 line:85.83%,end
He was

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:43.284 line:85.83%,end
your partner, right?

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.543 line:85.83%,end
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:56.130 line:85.83%,end
Your father will be disappointed.

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:04.680 line:85.83%,end
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:08.142 line:85.83%,end
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:10.770 line:85.83%,end
From this moment on,

00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:14.190 line:85.83%,end
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:15.858 line:85.83%,end
Pardon?

00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:17.777 line:85.83%,end
Even a phone call?

00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:21.072 line:85.83%,end
Get out!

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.133 line:85.83%,end
It was you, wasn't it?

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:45.638 line:85.83%,end
Did you see it?

00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:46.973 line:85.83%,end
Did you?

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.642 line:85.83%,end
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:51.310 line:85.83%,end
Who do you think you are?

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:54.897 line:85.83%,end
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:56.774 line:85.83%,end
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

00:37:57.858 --> 00:38:01.529 line:85.83%,end
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:11.330 line:85.83%,end
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:14.250 line:85.83%,end
who pretends to be a college girl.

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:20.965 line:85.83%,end
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:24.677 line:85.83%,end
Stop.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.845 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:27.638 line:85.83%,end
What's her problem?

00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:29.432 line:85.83%,end
You crazy b****!

00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:30.766 line:85.83%,end
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.186 line:85.83%,end
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.188 line:85.83%,end
Do you have a death wish?

00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.899 line:85.83%,end
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:05.343 line:85.83%,end
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.472 line:85.83%,end
But I feel so bad for her.

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.102 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:20.608 line:85.83%,end
This is Hosu University dorm.

00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:24.153 line:85.83%,end
My wound's been healed.

00:39:24.987 --> 00:39:27.239 line:85.83%,end
I'm ready for the operation.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.617 line:85.83%,end
I'm relieved.

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:34.038 line:85.83%,end
Do you know how worried I was?

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.708 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.960 line:85.83%,end
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:43.798 line:85.83%,end
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:46.801 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.469 line:85.83%,end
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:51.180 line:85.83%,end
You must accomplish this mission

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:53.432 line:85.83%,end
at all costs, okay?

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:55.434 line:85.83%,end
I'll remember that.

00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:58.604 line:85.83%,end
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.273 line:85.83%,end
have their guns pointed at me.

00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:06.445 line:85.83%,end
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:08.072 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget that.

00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:10.074 line:85.83%,end
I've never forgotten that.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.286 line:85.83%,end
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.261 line:85.83%,end
What did I tell you?

00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:33.722 line:85.83%,end
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:35.474 line:85.83%,end
In any case,

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.102 line:85.83%,end
I'm glad that he's alive.

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:45.317 line:85.83%,end
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

00:40:46.026 --> 00:40:47.236 line:85.83%,end
But Comrade,

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.613 line:85.83%,end
we decided to send in a new team.

00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:55.161 line:85.83%,end
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:09.425 line:85.83%,end
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.
