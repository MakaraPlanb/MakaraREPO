I'll be okay. So go.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.231 line:85.83%,end
Go now.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.535 line:85.83%,end
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.704 line:85.83%,end
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.044 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.807 line:85.83%,end
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.643 line:85.83%,end
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.188 line:85.83%,end
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.522 line:85.83%,end
Don't you dare to lie.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.901 line:85.83%,end
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:00.902 line:85.83%,end
Since what time?

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.072 line:85.83%,end
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:07.033 line:85.83%,end
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:26.302 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. This punk.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.762 line:85.83%,end
Maybe he saw wrong.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.807 line:85.83%,end
Let's question him first.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.104 line:85.83%,end
I think

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.898 line:85.83%,end
since the last time I was here,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.401 line:85.83%,end
I've been traumatized.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.655 line:85.83%,end
I admired investigators like you so much

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:50.326 line:85.83%,end
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:52.703 line:85.83%,end
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.080 line:85.83%,end
So you thought a guy

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.166 line:85.83%,end
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:59.919 line:85.83%,end
but you were wrong?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.259 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:09.137 line:85.83%,end
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.515 line:85.83%,end
for the communists' dead drop…

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.147 line:85.83%,end
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.941 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.445 line:85.83%,end
I didn't know you were so busy.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.670 line:85.83%,end
I'm suddenly

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.090 line:85.83%,end
not sure which side you're on.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.926 line:85.83%,end
You might be on our side,

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.971 line:85.83%,end
on Soo-ho's side,

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.645 line:85.83%,end
or on the side of someone protecting him.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.856 line:85.83%,end
Which side are you on?

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.945 line:85.83%,end
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.534 line:85.83%,end
That hurts!

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.412 line:85.83%,end
My ribs!

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.125 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.628 line:85.83%,end
Please don't kill me.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.005 line:85.83%,end
What did you do wrong?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.052 line:85.83%,end
Actually…

Actually what?

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:53.324 line:85.83%,end
What, you idiot?

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:55.409 line:85.83%,end
I'll be discreet.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.538 line:85.83%,end
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:04.752 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.630 line:85.83%,end
