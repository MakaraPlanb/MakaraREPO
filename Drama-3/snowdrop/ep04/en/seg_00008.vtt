BEIJING, CHINA

00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:37.745 line:85.83%,end
Now we're on the same page.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:41.540 line:85.83%,end
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:45.252 line:85.83%,end
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:47.338 line:85.83%,end
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:49.590 line:85.83%,end
Our nationalities may be different,

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.759 line:85.83%,end
what matters is

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.928 line:85.83%,end
that our hearts are one.

00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:57.598 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't agree more.

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.767 line:85.83%,end
All right. I think it's time

00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:02.353 line:85.83%,end
to clink our glasses.

00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:12.488 line:85.83%,end
Not just this time

00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:17.409 line:85.83%,end
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:20.913 line:85.83%,end
In that sense, I want to say something.

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:23.249 line:85.83%,end
-What?
-You can say it.

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:29.922 line:85.83%,end
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:34.593 line:85.83%,end
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:42.351 line:85.83%,end
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

00:42:42.434 --> 00:42:44.353 line:85.83%,end
You worry too much for your own good.

00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:47.982 line:85.83%,end
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:48.941 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.367 line:85.83%,end
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:07.960 line:85.83%,end
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:24.893 line:85.83%,end
Why the hell

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.438 line:85.83%,end
are you ruining what's almost done?

00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:31.483 line:85.83%,end
What he demands is four times as much.

00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:33.611 line:85.83%,end
What's the use of winning the war

00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:36.488 line:85.83%,end
when we're going to be left with no money?

00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:38.490 line:85.83%,end
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.494 line:85.83%,end
What is wrong with you?

00:43:43.495 --> 00:43:47.291 line:85.83%,end
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:51.545 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:43:57.092 --> 00:43:58.469 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:00.846 line:85.83%,end
I get what you mean.

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:05.934 line:85.83%,end
If we lose this election,

00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.936 line:85.83%,end
Code 1, Code 2,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.314 line:85.83%,end
and you and I are all done for.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:15.778 line:85.83%,end
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:18.280 line:85.83%,end
This is just an insurance.

00:44:18.864 --> 00:44:22.117 line:85.83%,end
No one knows until the election's over.

00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:24.703 line:85.83%,end
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.372 line:85.83%,end
All of us.

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:36.173 line:85.83%,end
We'll rob the vault.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.344 line:85.83%,end
The vault?

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.642 line:85.83%,end
Lost money that even Code 1

00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:50.270 line:85.83%,end
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:57.403 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:13.585 line:85.83%,end
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:18.006 line:85.83%,end
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:18.966 line:85.83%,end
<i>Pong!</i>

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.885 line:85.83%,end
Let me join you often.

00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:24.471 line:85.83%,end
I'll come whenever you call me.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.182 line:85.83%,end
I'll drop out after this one.

00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:34.356 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:39.611 line:85.83%,end
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:41.029 line:85.83%,end
No?

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.491 line:85.83%,end
Right. I guess you're right.

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:48.996 line:85.83%,end
Unless 13 young virgins dieâ€¦

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.289 line:85.83%,end
Stop it.

00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:54.543 line:85.83%,end
You should watch what you say.

00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:58.088 line:85.83%,end
What is that about?

00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.472 line:85.83%,end
Unless 13 young virgins die,

00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:09.808 line:85.83%,end
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:12.102 line:85.83%,end
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.607 line:85.83%,end
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something
