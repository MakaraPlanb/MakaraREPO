EPISODE 4

3
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,720
But this is…

4
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,307
Your sister gave it to you.

5
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,019
I think I can only leave…

6
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,607
without worrying about you

7
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,860
when I know you're wearing it.

8
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,376
But you need to wear it to stay safe.

9
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,629
I'm not the one being chased.

10
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,094
Just keep it.

11
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,724
It's the only thing I can give you.

12
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,026
Lim Soo-ho…

13
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,486
What's taking them so long?

14
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,405
They're going to miss him.

15
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,657
Damn it.

16
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:12,751
Gwang-tae, don't tell me
you called the cops.

17
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,753
If you know who he really is--

18
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,048
If he gets caught, I'll be arrested too!

19
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,805
Why will you be arrested?
You have nothing to do with him.

20
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:28,725
My roommates

21
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,728
have been hiding him.

22
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,773
He came into our room,

23
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,900
so we've been hiding him.

24
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,196
Darn it.

25
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,656
You traitor!

26
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,418
Yeong-ro!

27
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,297
Gwang-tae saw him!

28
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,967
Hurry up. Go now!

29
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,685
Will you be okay?

30
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,771
I'll be okay. So go.

31
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,231
Go now.

32
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,535
-How did that happen?
-Let's go.

33
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,704
I'll explain on the way. Hurry!

THE 53RD
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORM OPEN HOUSE

35
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,044
Hey!

36
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,807
Have you seen a guy on a bicycle here?

37
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,643
-No, I haven't.
-A guy in a suit on a bicycle.

38
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,188
-I haven't.
-Are you sure?

39
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,522
Don't you dare to lie.

40
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,901
We've been here for a while
but haven't seen such a guy.

41
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:01,902
Since what time?

42
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:05,072
-About 20 minutes ago, right?
-Yes.

43
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,033
We ate <i>tteokbokki</i> near here. Why?

44
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,302
Damn it. This punk.

45
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,762
Maybe he saw wrong.

46
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,807
Let's question him first.

47
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,104
I think

48
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,898
since the last time I was here,

49
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,401
I've been traumatized.

50
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,655
I admired investigators like you so much

51
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:51,326
that I was determined to catch
that bastard for our country and people.

52
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,703
So everyone must've looked like him to me.

53
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,080
So you thought a guy

54
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,166
in a suit riding a bicycle was Lim Soo-ho,

55
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,919
but you were wrong?

56
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,259
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:10,137
We happened to be searching Mount Ogong

58
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,515
for the communists' dead drop…

59
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,147
when you called to tell us you saw Soo-ho.

60
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,941
I'm so sorry.

61
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,445
I didn't know you were so busy.

62
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,670
I'm suddenly

63
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:47,090
not sure which side you're on.

64
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,926
You might be on our side,

65
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,971
on Soo-ho's side,

66
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:00,645
or on the side of someone protecting him.

67
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,856
Which side are you on?

68
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:08,945
-Make him talk.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,534
That hurts!

70
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:17,412
My ribs!

71
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,125
I'm so sorry.

72
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,628
Please don't kill me.

73
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,005
What did you do wrong?

74
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,052
Actually…

75
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,849
BAEKHA BREWERY

76
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,519
<i>Seol-hui's Baekha Brewery's
president's daughter.</i>

77
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,188
<i>It's the perfect chance to win her heart.</i>

78
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,398
Gwang-tae.

79
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,028
Actually?

80
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,364
Actually what?

81
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,324
What, you idiot?

82
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,409
I'll be discreet.

83
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:59,538
I won't call you
unless I'm completely sure.

84
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:05,752
I'm so sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,630
I'm so sorry.

86
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,521
<i>To actualize the ideals
of the Seoul Olympics…</i>

87
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,439
Why are you so late?

88
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,526
-I'm sorry.
<i>-The Seoul Olympics</i>

89
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,403
<i>-will be a global festival…</i>
-Go in.

90
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:35,949
<i>…for the whole world to enjoy,
and not a mere sports competition.</i>

91
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:41,288
<i>So for the first time ever,
Korea will be holding the largest…</i>

92
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,535
Comrade.

93
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,670
Where's Geum-cheol?

94
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,549
We got intel that he took
his own life by taking cyanide.

95
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,636
I'll take responsibility.
I should've kept a closer watch--

96
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,888
I'm the team leader. It's all on me.

97
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,477
And I'll report so, so you keep quiet.

98
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,898
I should report first.

99
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:04,037
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

100
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,414
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

101
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,542
don't hesitate…

102
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,129
to kill him.

103
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,679
What happened?

104
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,766
I was injured while being chased.
I couldn't do anything.

105
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,768
I'm back,
so we should resume the operation.

106
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,020
The team our party sent will arrive soon.

107
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,652
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,739
I'll have Han I-seop
defect to the North myself.

109
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,866
It's not likely to succeed.

110
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,495
Your face is well known now,

111
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:49,249
ANSP will keep guard over Han,
so how will you…

112
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:00,635
Just look into Han's whereabouts. Now.

113
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,381
EUN YEONG-U

114
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,969
<i>They're the suit and shoes
you'll wear tomorrow.</i>

115
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,513
They're my brother's.

116
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,849
I wonder if they fit you.

117
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,062
Why don't you try them on?

118
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:05,325
My, Yeong-ro.
Your partner was so handsome.

119
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,786
He was so hot!

120
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,038
You think so? He looked a bit dense to me.

121
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,499
He let that partner of Hye-ryeong
walk all over him.

122
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,542
What are you talking about?

123
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:17,504
Didn't you see him shooting the pistol?
He looked so cool.

124
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,088
He was so manly.

125
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,381
What's he majoring in?

126
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,300
-Which college?
-How did you meet him?

127
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:25,470
What's the point of being good at shooting
when he's terrible at dancing?

128
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,889
-Stop that.
-Who cares?

129
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,391
-Just move your body, then it's dancing.
-Right.

130
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,993
<i>I think I can only leave…</i>

131
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:54,207
<i>without worrying about you
when I know you're wearing it.</i>

132
00:13:58,461 --> 00:13:59,629
EUN YEONG-RO'S

133
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,885
Bun-ok.

134
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:09,514
We need to talk.

135
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:35,415
How long has it been?

136
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,085
-Sorry?
-When did you two start…

137
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,344
You must've been mocking me.

138
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,848
I don't follow you.

139
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,187
I'm such an idiot.
How did I not know he was with you?

140
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,065
Hearing me say he was in Berlin

141
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,610
and told me to come because he missed me,

142
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:07,655
you must've found it ridiculous
and mocked me.

143
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,199
I'm so sorry.

144
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:13,119
You must've looked down on me so much

145
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,832
that you invited him here
when I was working in the dorm,

146
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,669
and walked around with him
having a good time in front of me!

147
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,511
Did you call him first?

148
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,016
-Did you hit on him first?
-No.

149
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:41,481
On the day of the blind date,
at a record shop,

150
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,441
I ran into him.

151
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,735
At a record shop?

152
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,946
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

153
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,991
I have other plans,
so I'm afraid I can't go to the concert.

154
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,039
That bastard…

155
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,208
He told me he had other plans.

156
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:04,504
You told him I wasn't a college student,

157
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,173
didn't you?

158
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:08,883
No. I never did.

159
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,551
Why would I tell him that?

160
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,522
Right. You did nothing wrong.

161
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:26,275
A girl like me, who isn't even
a college student, dared to join you guys

162
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:30,530
and dream about a guy from Berlin
who is way out of her league.

163
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:40,748
I'll know my place from now on.

164
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:42,959
Thanks.

165
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,857
Damn it.

172
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,639
He didn't come in through ticket checking.

173
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,394
That's right.

174
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,730
Maybe…

175
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:49,150
the spy is hiding in there.

176
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,235
Come on. I doubt that.

177
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,445
DO NOT ENTER

178
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,491
He must've hidden on the fourth floor.
That's right.

179
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,242
Hold on.

180
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,205
That means that guy is…

181
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,793
the spy?

182
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,133
Hold on.

183
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:17,095
Then the guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

184
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,138
The guy hiding
on the fourth floor was the spy.

185
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,265
She must be so mad.

186
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,309
The way Gizzard sees it,

187
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,020
you look like you're seeing him
behind her back.

188
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:30,316
She must be thinking
she should teach such a b**** a lesson.

189
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,693
Darn it.

190
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:35,446
Wait.

191
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,366
Bun-ok checked the invitation tickets.

192
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:41,369
She saw a guy that she'd never let in.

193
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,995
She'll find it suspicious.

194
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,416
What if she finds it out?

195
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,419
She'll never let it slide.

196
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,421
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,299
I'm sure she'll tell Ms. Pi.

198
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:56,968
I feel bad for Bun-ok,
but there's no other way.

199
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,428
We must play dumb. We must, okay?

200
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:01,097
That guy's gone.

201
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,182
And there's no proof that we hid him.

202
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,769
-Jeong-min, where did you put his clothes?
-Yes?

203
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,104
Say good night.

204
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,772
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

205
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,298
Yeong-ro.

206
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:36,674
Yes?

207
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,801
Why are you so startled?

208
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,098
Did you do something wrong?

209
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,477
No, ma'am.

210
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,021
I didn't.

211
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:53,524
Pull yourself together.

212
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,362
A single wrong choice can ruin your life.

213
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:02,116
The open house is over.

214
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,910
Get it together,

215
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,162
or you might mess up your exam.

216
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,079
Understood?

217
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,706
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:10,333
That'll be all.

219
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,417
Say good night.

220
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,170
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, ma'am.

221
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,682
It seems Bun-ok didn't tell her.

222
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,268
I'm sure she found out.

223
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,646
And she's not the type to let it slide.

224
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,190
I'm sure she's up to something.

225
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,235
I almost forgot.
Where are Soo-ho's clothes?

226
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,819
Oh, that.

227
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,573
It's too dangerous to leave it in here.

228
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:43,866
Right?

229
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,661
Where do you think is safest?

230
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:31,163
It's me, son. How did it go?

231
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:33,457
<i>What do you think?</i>

232
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,543
I put my organs as collateral.

233
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,920
I'll give them one of my kidneys.

234
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:41,674
And if it's not enough, I'll give them
all of my organs and drop dead.

235
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,844
<i>How could you say that, you brat?</i>

236
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,179
How could you say that to your father?

237
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:50,975
So why did you have to
get addicted to gambling?

238
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:52,852
You and your nagging again!

239
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,021
I'll go see you in two days,

240
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:56,647
so get the money ready.

241
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,240
All right. I'm back with money.

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,711
Go back in. I'll be okay.

243
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,189
Constitution Article 32…

244
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:52,370
…optimum wages
through social and economic means.

245
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,915
All citizens shall have the right to work.

246
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,002
The State shall endeavor to promote
the employment of workers

247
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,754
and to guarantee optimum…

248
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,094
All citizens shall have the right to work.

249
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:10,262
You should sleep in your room.

250
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,641
The State shall endeavor to promote

251
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:18,854
the employment of workers
and to guarantee optimum wages

252
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:22,191
through social and economic means…

253
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:26,153
Hey, you.

254
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,239
No running.

255
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,085
God, I was so startled.

256
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,379
What's up?

257
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,676
My goodness. So they are

258
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,345
the clothes that guy left behind?

259
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,014
I couldn't just keep them in my room.

260
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,684
I'll take them to the dry cleaner,

261
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,603
so just keep them for the night.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

262
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:01,230
Sure, let's do that.

263
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:05,359
The hall director never comes down here,

264
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,528
so don't worry, and go back to your room.

265
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:12,867
Thank you so much.

266
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,827
What's that now?

267
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:16,954
It's sweet potato!

268
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:19,331
Gosh, you really didn't have to.

269
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,376
I'll put it here, so have it later.

270
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,211
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,839
All right.

272
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:32,011
Oh, and Soo-ho told me
to tell you thank-you for him.

273
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:33,637
He managed to get out safely,

274
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,557
and it's all thanks to you.

275
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,058
I mean it.

276
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:39,810
Come on. I didn't do much.

277
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:42,188
Don't worry, and go back now.

278
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,105
Okay.

279
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:29,109
NO NAME

280
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,940
<i>Geum-cheol.</i>

281
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,527
<i>Our country will
never forget what you did.</i>

282
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,001
ANTI-COMMUNIST INVESTIGATIONS 1
TEAM LEADER

283
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,670
There must be a reason
they fled to Mount Ogong.

284
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:32,506
But we went through every grave
that looked suspicious.

285
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,010
If we find the dead drop, it'll only
be a matter of time before we catch him.

286
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,224
Take it.

287
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,935
What's all that?

288
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:47,187
You haven't eaten yet, right?

289
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,149
<i>Tteokbokki</i>, kimbap, and fish cakes…

290
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:53,068
No one will appreciate it
even if we skip our meals.

291
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:54,987
What's with the orchid?

292
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,286
I went to the market
and it caught my eyes.

293
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,331
-Go bring Seung-jun.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,171
I thought you were out of my team.

295
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,060
I joined the ANSP

296
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,936
for only one reason.

297
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:37,404
The guy who left me all of a sudden…

298
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:41,784
The guy who vanished into thin air
after promising to marry me…

299
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:47,331
I only joined to ask him why.

300
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:52,586
I even followed him to Germany twice
but never saw him. And I've been…

301
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:56,965
waiting for him for six years.

302
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,803
-Why would I leave the team?
-It's regrettable

303
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:06,141
that you joined the agency
for such a personal reason.

304
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,103
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

305
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:12,940
Why…

306
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,610
Why on earth…

307
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:32,084
are they asking us
to stay out of Han's case?

308
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:36,422
I had our agents tail him closely.

309
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,382
So stay out of it.

310
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:39,800
Our agents?

311
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,137
You think they're loyal to you?

312
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,681
You think they'll do
what the high-ups told us not to?

313
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:07,202
I will keep an eye on Han myself.

314
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,544
Are you leaving already?
Aren't you eating?

315
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:20,507
I'm telling you,
she bought a lot for us. Look.

316
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,969
She's so generous, isn't she?

317
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,110
Hello?

318
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,739
I called to ask you something.

319
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,160
You said

320
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:51,455
you'd give me 50 million
if I gave you information on a spy.

321
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:54,833
If I give you information
on someone who harbored a spy,

322
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,752
how much will I get?

323
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:00,547
The same amount?

324
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:06,762
Why are you curious about that?

325
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,223
Pardon?

326
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,433
Why do you want to know
how much you'll get

327
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,560
for information
on someone who harbored a spy?

328
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,147
Gye Bun-ok.

329
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,738
Because I'll turn someone in.

330
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:26,907
What?

331
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:28,450
Turn in?

332
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:32,371
Guys in room 207 hid a spy.

333
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:35,499
What are you talking about?

334
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:38,460
I knew this would happen,
so I kept the proof.

335
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:43,215
Come on.

336
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,008
Why are you going through that?

337
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,054
What's going on?

338
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,226
That's…

339
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,484
I'm sorry.

340
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:09,324
Well, this is…

341
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,620
I mean,

342
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:17,082
what happened is that…

343
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

344
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,005
Thank you for everything.

345
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:26,717
Pardon? I don't understand what you mean.

346
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,012
I'll hire your successor in a few days,
so make sure to train him well.

347
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:34,141
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

348
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:36,810
I was so thoughtless.

349
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,021
-Forgive me this once.
-Follow me with it.

350
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:41,815
Oh, no.

351
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:45,569
Ma'am. Ms. Pi?

352
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:48,822
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me this once.

353
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:50,908
My goodness.

354
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,683
The guy they hid

355
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,853
isn't a spy but a student protester.

356
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:25,067
But everyone from the ANSP
says he's a spy from the North.

357
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,364
Fine. Let's say he is.

358
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:34,952
You think providing a roof and food
qualifies as harboring?

359
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:39,957
If the court doesn't decide it's
harboring a spy, you won't get the reward.

360
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,794
I'm not doing this for money.

361
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:46,254
You must report anyone harboring a spy.

362
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,923
That's our duty.

363
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:50,550
Duty? So what if you do?

364
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,513
You think they won't question you?

365
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:00,185
They don't hesitate to make
someone innocent a spy to produce results.

366
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,648
Don't you think you're such easy prey?

367
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,609
I mean,

368
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,238
you're a communist's sister.

369
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:18,662
I am not.

370
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,331
My sister is not a Northern spy!

371
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:25,377
Because of her, a perfectly fine family
was ruined. You want to see that again?

372
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:27,838
50 million won?

373
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:32,509
You'll be lucky if you're not tortured
or don't go to jail!

374
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:35,053
Don't do anything stupid, and stay quiet.

375
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:38,390
Did you forget
even factories won't hire you?

376
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,442
If it weren't for my old teacher,

377
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,653
I'd have never hired you.

378
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,370
If you understood,

379
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,499
tell everyone in room 207
to come to my office.

380
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:49,252
Did you hide him on the fourth floor?

381
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:53,965
It's all my fault.

382
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:56,384
I begged them to hide him.

383
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,553
Seol-hui and the rest
didn't do anything wrong.

384
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,472
Jeong-min, you should've stopped it.

385
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:03,433
He was a protester
being chased by the cops.

386
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,852
I couldn't ignore him.

387
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:09,397
What if he's not a protester but a spy?

388
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,733
No, he isn't. He can't be a spy.

389
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:14,861
-I met him on a blind date--
-They came to catch a spy here.

390
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:17,781
They can easily make you guys spies.

391
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,783
No, they can easily make

392
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:22,410
everyone in this dorm
spies from the North.

393
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:33,797
Room 207.

394
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:38,093
You know one more mistake meant
getting kicked out, right?

395
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:42,681
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

396
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:46,101
They all told me we should call the cops,

397
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:49,312
but I insisted
on hiding him just for one night.

398
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,858
And they didn't know
I hid him on the fourth floor.

399
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:54,192
Please let me be punished.

400
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:56,778
Please let me be solely responsible!

401
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:04,119
Fine, if you say so.

402
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,330
You pack up and leave the dorm tomorrow,
Eun Yeong-ro.

403
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:19,217
Ma'am, Yeong-ro's just a freshman.

404
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:20,927
I'll leave instead.

405
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,220
I helped him too--

406
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,597
Of course,

407
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:26,808
she couldn't have done it by herself.

408
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,899
But…

409
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:37,152
I'm sure she's the one who led it.

410
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,531
He was

411
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:44,284
your partner, right?

412
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,543
You know you shouldn't do
this kind of thing.

413
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,130
Your father will be disappointed.

414
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:05,680
The rest of you. Yeo Jeong-min,
Ko Hye-ryeong, and Yoon Seol-hui.

415
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:09,142
One more violation,
and you'll all get kicked out.

416
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:11,770
From this moment on,

417
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:15,190
the three of you won't be allowed
to receive calls from the outside.

418
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,858
Pardon?

419
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:18,777
Even a phone call?

420
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,072
Get out!

421
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,133
It was you, wasn't it?

422
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,638
Did you see it?

423
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,973
Did you?

424
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:50,642
Do you look down on me
because I'm an operator?

425
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:52,310
Who do you think you are?

426
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:55,897
You're nothing better than me
except being born into a rich family!

427
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,774
-Are you crazy?
-Hye-ryeong.

428
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,529
So is that why you pretended to be
a college girl and went on a blind date?

429
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:12,330
You must be so upset that you won't get
any calls because of a stupid girl

430
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:15,250
who pretends to be a college girl.

431
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,965
Well, thanks to that, I'll have less work.

432
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:25,677
Stop.

433
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,845
Let's go.

434
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:28,638
What's her problem?

435
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,432
You crazy b****!

436
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:31,766
-Hey.
-Hye-ryeong.

437
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,186
I know what you did.
Stop lying, you wench!

438
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,188
Do you have a death wish?

439
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:39,899
-You crazy b****!
-Stop!

440
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,343
What happened? I knew it'd happen.

441
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,472
But I feel so bad for her.

442
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,102
Let's go.

443
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:21,608
This is Hosu University dorm.

444
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:25,153
My wound's been healed.

445
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,239
I'm ready for the operation.

446
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,617
I'm relieved.

447
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:35,038
Do you know how worried I was?

448
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,708
I couldn't sleep worrying about you.

449
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,960
<i>I need to go back to Pyongyang,</i>

450
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:44,798
but I've been waiting in Beijing
for you to call.

451
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:47,801
I'm sorry for worrying you, Father.

452
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:49,469
<i>Soo-hyeok.</i>

453
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:52,180
You must accomplish this mission

454
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,432
at all costs, okay?

455
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,434
I'll remember that.

456
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:59,604
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

457
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:02,273
have their guns pointed at me.

458
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:07,445
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

459
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,072
Don't forget that.

460
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,074
I've never forgotten that.

461
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:15,286
I'll return
after accomplishing the mission.

462
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,261
What did I tell you?

463
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:34,722
Didn't I tell you
that my son was definitely alive?

464
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:36,474
In any case,

465
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,102
I'm glad that he's alive.

466
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:46,317
My son will complete the mission
as planned.

467
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:48,236
But Comrade,

468
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,613
we decided to send in a new team.

469
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:56,161
The team you sent will help
my son accomplish the mission.

470
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:10,425
From now on, stay out
of our negotiation with the South.

471
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,766
BEIJING, CHINA

472
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:38,745
Now we're on the same page.

473
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:42,540
Now I feel that we're actually all Korean.

474
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:46,252
Of course we are.
You're hurting my feelings.

475
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:48,338
<i>400 million dollars?</i>

476
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:50,590
Our nationalities may be different,

477
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,759
what matters is

478
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:54,928
that our hearts are one.

479
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:58,598
I couldn't agree more.

480
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,767
All right. I think it's time

481
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,353
to clink our glasses.

482
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:13,488
Not just this time

483
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:18,409
but for the next elections to come,
we should work together like this.

484
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:21,913
In that sense, I want to say something.

485
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,249
-What?
-You can say it.

486
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:30,922
As you know, it's the election season,
so we don't have much spare money.

487
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:35,593
So it'll be hard to prepare
four times what we originally promised.

488
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,351
Gosh, Mr. Eun.

489
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:45,353
You worry too much for your own good.

490
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:48,982
We're about to win the war, so why worry
about how much we can come up with?

491
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:49,941
Right?

492
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,367
I'll go to the restroom for a bit.

493
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:08,960
It's not easy to establish
a new administration, is it?

494
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,893
Why the hell

495
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:28,438
are you ruining what's almost done?

496
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:32,483
What he demands is four times as much.

497
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,611
What's the use of winning the war

498
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:37,488
when we're going to be left with no money?

499
00:43:37,572 --> 00:43:39,490
Do you think Code 1 will like it?

500
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,494
What is wrong with you?

501
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:48,291
Are you stupid? Or have you gone senile?

502
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:52,545
What?

503
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,469
I understand.

504
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:01,846
I get what you mean.

505
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,934
If we lose this election,

506
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:08,936
Code 1, Code 2,

507
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,314
and you and I are all done for.

508
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:16,778
Everyone is predicting
that we're going to win.

509
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:19,280
This is just an insurance.

510
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:23,117
No one knows until the election's over.

511
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,703
If we lose, we'll all be dead. Literally.

512
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:27,372
All of us.

513
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,173
We'll rob the vault.

514
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:41,344
The vault?

515
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,642
Lost money that even Code 1

516
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:51,270
and the Assembly don't know
how much it is.

517
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:58,403
The ANSP's secret fund
that requires no receipts.

518
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,585
I'm so glad that you joined us, Dr. Kang.

519
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:19,006
The most difficult part of Mahjong
is to gather four people to play.

520
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:19,966
<i>Pong!</i>

521
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,885
Let me join you often.

522
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:25,471
I'll come whenever you call me.

523
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,182
I'll drop out after this one.

524
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:35,356
Oh, my. I guess you're not feeling
very well today.

525
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:40,611
Is it because what he said
about 13 virgins is bothering you?

526
00:45:40,695 --> 00:45:42,029
No?

527
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,491
Right. I guess you're right.

528
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:49,996
Unless 13 young virgins die…

529
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,289
Stop it.

530
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:55,543
You should watch what you say.

531
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:59,088
What is that about?

532
00:46:05,678 --> 00:46:07,472
Unless 13 young virgins die,

533
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,808
something bad will happen
to her husband, apparently.

534
00:46:10,892 --> 00:46:13,102
I'm grateful for worrying about me,

535
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,607
but to be honest,
I don't think it's something

536
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,484
I should pay attention to.

537
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:26,449
How could you say that?

538
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:29,202
You know how good the fortuneteller is.

539
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:36,250
Whether you believe him or not
is up to you.

540
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,252
Unless war breaks out,

541
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:40,505
you can't kill 13 virgins.

542
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:42,507
Besides, this is your second marriage.

543
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:45,092
So if your husband dies,

544
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,346
you'll be in a pitiful situation,
Ms. Hong.

545
00:46:57,939 --> 00:47:00,817
Your future is whatever you make it.

546
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,945
Even Yi Seong-gye slit his palm
to change the lines

547
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:05,655
to become king

548
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:09,408
when he was withdrawing
his army from Wihwa Island.

549
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:14,539
Exactly.
"Everything depends on your mind."

550
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:17,083
Your future is whatever you make it.

551
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:22,338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

552
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:36,853
I'm sorry, Yeong-ro,

553
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:39,146
that you have to leave while we stay.

554
00:47:40,189 --> 00:47:43,442
Don't be, Hye-ryeong.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

555
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:46,487
Because of me,
you can't even get phone calls.

556
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:50,032
Have you decided where to go?

557
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,204
Your cousin's house?

558
00:47:57,582 --> 00:47:58,875
My father's house.

559
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:00,751
Your father?

560
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:02,587
Your father lives in Seoul?

561
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:08,885
After my mom passed away ten years ago,

562
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:13,806
he married this really annoying woman.

563
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:19,270
Since then, I lived with my grandma
in the countryside.

564
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:23,524
I feel so bad for you, Yeong-ro.

565
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:29,113
Come on. I'm all right.

566
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,949
I'll be glad if I lose weight
from walking on eggshells.

567
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:34,118
Cheers.

568
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:36,704
Goodness.

569
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:39,332
Yeong-ro…

570
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,126
Stop crying.

571
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:44,503
Stop.

572
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,018
Since I moved into the dorm,

573
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:03,022
I've made new friends,
and you two are like

574
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,941
big sisters to me.

575
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:11,364
I have been really happy
living here with you.

576
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:20,915
Thank you guys so much for everything.

577
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,793
I mean it.

578
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:37,181
-Yeong-ro…
-Hye-ryeong.

579
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,434
-Yeong-ro…
-Yeong-ro…

580
00:49:40,518 --> 00:49:42,561
-Yeong-ro…
-Hey, stop crying.

581
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,110
I'll come visit you often.

584
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,927
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm.</i>

<i>Before I leave,</i>

586
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,437

It's been over a month
since my last confession, Father.

604
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:34,817
It's been a while.

605
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:39,196
Professor Han I-seop.

606
00:52:56,255 --> 00:53:00,634
Have you checked where your son's been
since he went missing six months ago?

607
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,929
No! My son can't be in Pyongyang.

608
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:07,433
As you know, the woman he was seeing
while studying in the US was

609
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,977
a Korean-American
doing business with the North.

610
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,606
And of course,
we had already won her over to our side.

611
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:20,279
Six months ago, your son went
from the US to Austria with her.

612
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:22,907
I'm sure you looked into it.

613
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,911
And I guided the two to Pyongyang

614
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:29,371
from Austria myself.

615
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:47,598
I can show you a letter your son sent.

616
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,896
Min-jae sent a letter?

617
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:56,232
Even the CIA doesn't know yet

618
00:53:56,899 --> 00:53:59,276
that your son is in Pyongyang.

619
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,614
But I'm sure it won't take long
for them to find it out.

620
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:05,532
And once they do,

621
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:09,078
it'll be just a matter of time
until the ANSP does too.

622
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:17,086
As I told you many times,

623
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:20,547
your son willingly went to the North.

624
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:26,804
It's just that
my country hasn't announced it yet

625
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,890
for your sake, Professor.

626
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,773
Your son…

627
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,528
misses his father so much,

628
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:44,488
Professor Han.

629
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:55,749
TAXI

630
00:54:57,501 --> 00:54:58,627
Let's go.

631
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:37,124
What? Why are you taking this route?

632
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:38,792
Hey, driver!

633
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,419
Hey, driver!

634
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:53,057
Hey!

635
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,112
Damn it!

636
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,782
-Damn it!
-This is crazy.

637
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:11,325
-What the hell?
-Move!

638
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:12,451
"Move"?

639
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,705
Look. You just ruined all of my fruit.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

640
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,668
You can't go anywhere
before compensating me for them. Okay?

641
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:24,004
Are you listening? You can't leave!

642
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:25,464
I lost them.

643
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,257
Kill me first if you want to leave.

644
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,926
How will you compensate?

645
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:31,428
-How?
-My goodness.

646
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,681
<i>-Galaxy.</i>
-I'm talking to you.

647
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:36,975
My God, she doesn't seem to care at all.

648
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,685
This is Galaxy.

649
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,146
<i>We got something from the bug.</i>

650
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:55,452
It won't be good once it's cold.
If you don't want it, I'll--

651
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:09,466
He eats and repeats the same words
over and over.

652
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,845
-So I--
-I told you to question him, not beat him.

653
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:18,016
I'm telling the truth.
I just mistook someone for him.

654
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:21,019
I grew up with a single mom.

655
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:24,565
For the sake of my mother in the
countryside who's counting on me,

656
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,900
I must succeed.

657
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,987
So why would I help a communist?

658
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,912
-Don't you do anything stupid.
-Of course not.

659
00:57:42,082 --> 00:57:43,542
I'll be discreet

660
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:46,628
and make sure to get the job done.

661
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:48,464
Let him go.

662
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:50,007
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:54,720
I'll return your kindness one day!

664
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,765
Sir!

665
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:02,686
The wiretapping team told me
they got something from the bug.

666
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:05,856
If we can decipher--

667
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:33,050
He moved to some quiet suburb.

668
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:35,427
What does it mean?

669
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:38,847
"The scenery is so beautiful

670
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:43,185
that I miss you so much, Dad."
What does this mean?

671
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:44,853
What are you doing?

672
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:02,246
Professor.

673
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,876
For someone who's lived in New York,
it's not easy to live there.

674
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:10,629
Since your son went over to Pyongyang,

675
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,923
he's been trying to escape.

676
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:16,009
What do I have to do
to get him out of there?

677
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:17,553
Go to the North

678
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:20,722
and get out of there with him.

679
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:28,230
What?

680
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:30,524
We'll help you get out with him

681
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:33,318
safely and in secret

682
00:59:35,112 --> 00:59:36,905
before the CIA finds it out.

683
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:52,838
What do I have to do in return?

684
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,758
That I don't know of.
But what I do know is

685
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:01,138
that if you do what the North wants,

686
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:04,433
you'll be able to get out safely
with your son.

687
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:08,895
I'll give you my word.

688
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:12,774
Get some rest here.

689
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:35,839
You guys go first with Professor Han.

690
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:38,425
Are you not coming with us?

691
01:00:38,508 --> 01:00:42,095
The party ordered me to pick up
weapons and money from Mount Ogong.

692
01:00:42,763 --> 01:00:44,598
Tonight at 22:00,

693
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,018
we're supposed to make
contact with our boat here.

694
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:49,645
So I'll be there before then.

695
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,274
<i>Watch him closely all the time,</i>

696
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:57,027
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

697
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:00,322
<i>don't hesitate…</i>

698
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:04,326
to kill him.

699
01:01:13,543 --> 01:01:15,337
If we don't get this done,

700
01:01:17,297 --> 01:01:19,591
then the late Geum-cheol died for nothing.

701
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,470
We must accomplish the mission.

702
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,097
Understood?

703
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:28,809
-For our country and people!
-For our country and people!

01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:36,775
COSMOS TOYS

Hoping to go to the North

01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:41,965
as soon as possible."

710
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,801
So it was the dorm.

711
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:47,387
Let's go.

712
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:54,204
Oh, right.
Who were you talking to on the phone?

713
01:03:54,788 --> 01:03:58,250
What? On the phone?

714
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,044
You called someone
from the pay phone near the dorm.

715
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:04,506
Oh, that? It was my friend.

716
01:04:04,923 --> 01:04:07,467
She wanted to visit me during a break, so…

717
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:11,179
Yeong-ro, do you need help?

718
01:04:13,473 --> 01:04:16,393
By the way, how will she move all this?

719
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:17,978
I called Byeong-tae.

720
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,231
He has a car,
so he'll move all this with it.

721
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:24,568
Thank you.
It'll be an easy trip thanks to you.

722
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:28,029
I didn't know
your boyfriend would be this useful.

723
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:41,543
What's that? Where did you get it?

724
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,753
It's nothing.

725
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:45,589
Didn't Soo-ho buy it for you?

726
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:50,343
You're getting kicked out because of him.
How come he hasn't called you yet?

727
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,057
How could he? He's being chased.

728
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:04,190
<i>Room 207.</i>

729
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:06,568
<i>Student Eun Yeong-ro,
there's a call for you.</i>

730
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,188
Hello?

731
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,523
I heard it from the hall director.

732
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:47,901
<i>What's with you and your brother?</i>

733
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:51,071
Your father is the director of the ANSP.
How could you hide a protester?

734
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,409
I'll send a car, so come straight home.

735
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:58,703
Don't be a troublemaker like your brother.

736
01:06:58,096 --> 01:06:59,764
<i>I told you to call me.</i>

737
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:02,434
<i>But you didn't give me an answer.</i>

738
01:07:06,396 --> 01:07:09,107
<i>I'm getting kicked out of the dorm today.</i>

739
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:13,987
<i>It's not that</i>

740
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,281
<i>I miss you.</i>

741
01:09:00,677 --> 01:09:02,554
<i>In case he runs towards Mount Ogong,</i>

742
01:09:02,637 --> 01:09:03,930
you and Dong-jae

743
01:09:04,013 --> 01:09:06,141
should head toward the dorm.

744
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:07,308
Yes, sir.

745
01:09:07,392 --> 01:09:08,726
We need to capture him.

746
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,937
<i>But if you're about to lose him,</i>

747
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:13,773
you're allowed to kill him. Over.

748
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:53,521
-Have you all filled your glasses?
-Yes!

749
01:09:53,605 --> 01:09:56,065
To our Yeong-ro's future!

750
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:58,276
-To her future!
-To her future!

751
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:01,571
My goodness, Yeong-ro.

752
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:04,157
You won't have a curfew anymore.
I'm jealous.

753
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,743
-I'm jealous too.
-You're free now.

754
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:07,911
Bye, Yeong-ro.

755
01:10:07,994 --> 01:10:09,662
Why don't we leave here too?

756
01:10:09,746 --> 01:10:11,998
-I can't believe you said that.
-What?

757
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:14,542
By the way,
has anyone been to Munhwa Coffee Shop?

758
01:10:14,626 --> 01:10:17,503
-Munhwa Coffee Shop?
-I went there!

759
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:19,964
For a blind date. And the guys there

760
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:21,424
looked so handsome.

761
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:24,469
And he asked me out!

762
01:10:38,942 --> 01:10:42,153
Yeong-ro!

763
01:10:44,197 --> 01:10:45,782
Yeong-ro…

764
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,495
She's not actually going anywhere.

765
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:52,622
Don't cry.

766
01:11:31,661 --> 01:11:33,997
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER

767
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,915
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE DORM TODAY

768
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:38,626
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

769
01:11:48,636 --> 01:11:49,971
Hey!

770
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:52,849
What a pervert.

771
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,685
Where do you think you're peeping?

772
01:11:55,768 --> 01:11:57,270
That punk.

773
01:11:57,353 --> 01:12:00,189
Are you a pervert?
Peeping into a women's university?

774
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:05,111
You bastard. I asked you questions.
How come you don't answer?

775
01:12:05,194 --> 01:12:07,822
And what's that look, you jerk?

776
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,200
Where are you going?

777
01:12:11,284 --> 01:12:14,704
You bastard. Come here.

778
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,333
Are you scared? Come here. It's all right.

779
01:12:22,086 --> 01:12:23,504
God damn it!

780
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:27,550
Damn it. What are the police doing here?

781
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:28,926
Are they after me?

782
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:32,638
What's going on?

783
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:38,728
I can't get caught.

784
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:48,946
God, I really need to exercise.
Why are they so fast?

785
01:12:52,825 --> 01:12:54,869
That hurt. Damn it.

786
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:58,373
Okay. I must get in here.

787
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:10,510
<i>We're approaching
the dorm from Mount Ogong.</i>

788
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,220
Darn it!

789
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:14,722
God, my hips.

790
01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:25,900
<i>We found a hut
in the middle of the mountain.</i>

791
01:13:26,943 --> 01:13:29,821
<i>We're heading there for backup.</i>

792
01:14:16,742 --> 01:14:18,035
They must be near here.

793
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,872
So call for backup and stand by here.

794
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:22,415
Everyone stand by.

795
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,752
Who are those guys? Who are they after?

796
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:29,005
Are they really here for my organs?

797
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:32,550
Those bastards. There's some time left.

798
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:34,802
Those cold-hearted bastards.

799
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:38,139
Wait. Why did so many come to get me?

800
01:14:38,931 --> 01:14:40,475
Maybe they're after this pervert.

801
01:14:40,558 --> 01:14:42,518
Hey, what's your deal?

802
01:14:43,102 --> 01:14:45,271
Wait a minute.

803
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:48,566
How dare you follow me in here?

804
01:14:49,692 --> 01:14:51,652
Did you just hit me?

805
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:56,324
Now even a pervert looks down on me?

806
01:14:56,991 --> 01:14:58,075
Come here.

807
01:14:58,784 --> 01:15:01,496
I'll teach you a lesson.

808
01:15:04,874 --> 01:15:06,334
My God.

809
01:15:44,622 --> 01:15:46,374
Gwang-tae, are you okay?

810
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,417
Seol-hui.

811
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:51,420
I didn't tell them anything.

812
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:54,465
To protect you, Seol-hui,

813
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:56,968
I endured all sorts of torturing

814
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,469
and…

815
01:16:02,098 --> 01:16:05,017
I, Oh Gwang-tae, am not a traitor.

816
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:08,646
Don't cry.

817
01:16:31,294 --> 01:16:35,464
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Stop right there! Hey!

818
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:37,758
Dad.

819
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:40,845
Don't try to sit down. Stand up.

820
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:44,807
What's going on?

821
01:16:45,725 --> 01:16:47,518
What's going on?

822
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:50,855
What if Hye-ryeong sees us?

823
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:57,737
-What's going on?
-Hye-ryeong?

824
01:16:58,696 --> 01:17:00,573
Hey, pal.

825
01:17:04,994 --> 01:17:06,203
Are you Oh Gwang-tae?

826
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:14,128
-Yes, what's your problem?
-What?

827
01:17:35,024 --> 01:17:38,194
-Hey, give me back my hat.
-Just a minute.

828
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:41,572
Hey.

829
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,742
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:46,494
Check upstairs.

831
01:20:04,507 --> 01:20:05,883
Lim Soo-ho!

832
01:20:11,597 --> 01:20:13,140
Drop the gun!

833
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:17,520
Stay away.

834
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:22,274
Drop the gun in three seconds,
or she's dead.

835
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:27,571
One.

836
01:20:29,532 --> 01:20:30,699
Two.

837
01:20:45,798 --> 01:20:47,299
Three.

838
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,976
<i>Are you saying they're
holding people hostage in the dorm?</i>

839
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,732
<i>In the middle of Seoul?</i>

840
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,235
<i>Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?</i>

841
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:09,405
Just crush him without anyone knowing.

842
01:21:09,488 --> 01:21:12,992
<i>The priority of this operation is
to rescue the chairman's daughter.</i>

843
01:21:13,075 --> 01:21:15,536
<i>All of us might end up dying.</i>

844
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:17,329
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

845
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:19,206
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

846
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,542
Plan B is the only option now.

847
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:22,835
<i>Kill them all if need be.</i>

848
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,843
<i>So you're really</i>

849
01:21:31,427 --> 01:21:34,179
<i>a spy from the North? Did I really</i>

850
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,640
save a spy?

851
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:38,893
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

852
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,275
BONUS

853
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:13,302
Yeong-ro.

854
01:22:14,053 --> 01:22:15,220
Everyone's ready.

855
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:24,229
-Hurry, Yeong-ro!
-Come on, Yeong-ro!

856
01:22:25,856 --> 01:22:28,317
All right. Turn your shoulders.

857
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,152
And make sure you show your faces.

858
01:22:31,403 --> 01:22:33,572
-Closer.
-Okay.

859
01:22:33,656 --> 01:22:36,241
-Hurry up.
-Smile.

860
01:22:36,325 --> 01:22:39,912
All right. There we go. One, two, three!
