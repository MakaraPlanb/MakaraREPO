SNOWDROP

EPISODE 5

5
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,729
<i>We're covering
the dorm's front door. Over.</i>

6
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,699
<i>We're approaching too as I speak. Over.</i>

7
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,489
Lim Soo-ho!

8
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,619
Drop the guns!

9
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,789
Lim Soo-ho.

10
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,209
You're surrounded.

11
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:01,789
Stay away.

12
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,839
I'll shoot her.

13
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,749
Come down.

14
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,339
Stay away!

15
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,469
Stay away!

16
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,679
The students will get hurt.

17
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,269
Hey, it's all right.

18
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:22,689
Don't be scared.

19
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,069
It's all right.

20
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,119
Drop the guns.

21
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,629
Do it in three seconds, or she's dead.

22
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,009
One.

23
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,089
Two.

24
00:02:58,769 --> 00:02:59,769
Lim Soo-ho.

25
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:14,369
Three.

26
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,289
Comrade!

27
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:53,949
<i>Detective Jang.</i>

28
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,949
Who shoots during a civil defense drill?

29
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,529
Don't tell me

30
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,489
war's broken out.

31
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,049
Hang in there, Mr. Lee.

32
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:28,399
Mr. Lee, just hang in there.

33
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,689
You'll be okay.

34
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,609
Damn it.

35
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,999
God damn bastards…

36
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,139
Stop it!

37
00:05:58,739 --> 00:05:59,859
I've run out of ammo.

38
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,189
-Hold fire!
-Hold fire!

39
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,399
Hold fire, you idiots!

40
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,579
Those bastards.

41
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,009
<i>Ballistic shields, go!</i>

42
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,029
Damn it.

43
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,129
-Aim guns!
-Aim guns!

44
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,249
<i>We need backup inside the dorm.
We need backup.</i>

45
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,129
<i>The fourth unit, ETA one minute.</i>

46
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,709
<i>Shield unit, advance.</i>

47
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:35,809
Watch out!

48
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,979
Mr. Lee!

49
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,939
He has grenades!

50
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:37,553
Drop the guns.

51
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,063
Lower your guns.

52
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,113
Lim Soo-ho.

53
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,613
She's just a student.

54
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,793
Get out.

55
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:01,583
All of you!

56
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:12,883
Get out.

57
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,133
All units, withdraw.

58
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,183
Wait.

59
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,523
You're in charge, right?

60
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,283
You stay.

61
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,403
He's been shot,

62
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,323
but you'll hold him hostage?

63
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,493
Listen carefully.

64
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,543
If you attack us,

65
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,673
I'll kill him first.

66
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,303
All right.

67
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,473
I'll stay here,

68
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,103
but let the students go.

69
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:02,723
Are you crazy? You've been shot!

70
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,433
You hypocritical bastards.

71
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:06,233
Get out.

72
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,353
I'll never leave without you.

73
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:11,443
He'll never be able to escape anyway.

74
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:14,033
-Capture him if you can.
-Sir.

75
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:14,993
Go now.

76
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,493
Get out.

77
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,953
No…

78
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:26,583
No, I can't! Let go of me!

79
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:28,293
-All units, withdraw!
-No!

80
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,043
Let go of me, you bastards!

81
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,633
-No!
-Call for medics now!

82
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,973
-Many are injured.
-Let go!

83
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,223
I have to go back!

84
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:43,103
-Let go of me!
-Get the transportation ready!

85
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:54,823
Come with me.

86
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,303
What about Professor Han?

87
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:20,843
The other members will take him safely.

88
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,013
What do we do now?

89
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,853
We must get
to the rendezvous point by 22:00.

90
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,233
We'll get out of here
and join the other agents at all costs.

91
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,853
I'll block all of the doors.

92
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:35,153
Gather all the hostages
in the cafeteria on the second floor.

93
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:37,783
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,473
Come out.

95
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:01,633
Now!

96
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:03,513
Come out here!

97
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:06,393
Move it!

98
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:07,813
Move faster.

99
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:08,853
Faster.

100
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:10,853
Hey, you there.

101
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,313
Move it.

102
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,943
I'm coming.

103
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:20,613
Hey.

104
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:22,283
Come out here.

105
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,783
Move it!

106
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,703
You too, idiot. Now!

107
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:51,273
This is crazy. God damn it.

108
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,983
There are men injured. We need medics.

109
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,573
Black Tiger's been shot.

110
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,493
And he's taken hostage with students.

111
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,283
<i>We need more backup right now. Over.</i>

112
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,163
What do you mean?

113
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,083
Are you saying

114
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:15,793
they're holding people hostage
in the dorm? Over.

115
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,503
Taedong River 1 threatened
with grenades, so we couldn't help it.

116
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,253
<i>But there are just three of them.</i>

117
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,513
It won't be hard to take them down. Over.

118
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,263
Stand by.

119
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,473
Stay put until I give you orders.

120
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,933
<i>-Over and out.</i>
-There are men injured.

121
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,063
We need medics.

122
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:40,363
Hold people hostage
in the middle of Seoul?

123
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,693
What, do these bastards have a death wish?

124
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:46,493
Wait a minute.

125
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:49,413
If the chairman finds out
that I've sent the forces…

126
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,833
Damn it.

127
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,383
Ms. Choi.

128
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:01,843
Ms. Choi.

129
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,713
Don't you know I'm fitting Ms. Hong?

130
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,683
It's your husband. I told him,
but he still wanted to speak to you.

131
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:11,763
It must be something urgent. Go ahead.

132
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:13,353
Excuse me, then.

133
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,853
What is it this time?

134
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,363
What? Spies?

135
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:36,713
<i>Slow down. What's going on?</i>

136
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,043
<i>In the Hosu Women's University dorm,</i>

137
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:42,793
Northern spies are holding people hostage!

138
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:44,803
Holding people hostage?

139
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:47,133
<i>In the Hosu University dorm?</i>

140
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,763
Wait. Hold on.

141
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,313
Whether he'll ascend into the sky
with a magical bead

142
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:57,063
or die from falling off a horse,

143
00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:00,813
<i>it all depends on 13 young virgins.</i>

144
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,193
Oh, my God.

145
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,863
Then Eun Chang-su
is destined to become king?

146
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:08,993
<i>What the hell are you talking about?</i>

147
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:13,123
If our chairman finds out
that I sent the forces, I'll catch hell!

148
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,543
Honey.

149
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:18,293
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

150
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:22,543
Eun Chang-su might be able
to become a future presidential candidate

151
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,753
instead of Nam Tae-il.

152
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:24,923
<i>What?</i>

153
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,133
The chairman might?

154
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:28,423
How do you know that?

155
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:30,013
This fortuneteller said…

156
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,353
Never mind. It's a long story.

157
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:37,273
Anyway, you mustn't get
on Eun Chang-su's bad side from now on.

158
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:38,813
Then.

159
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:42,653
What happened is that Gang-mu
went to catch him against my orders.

160
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,823
Of course. It's true
that bastard never listens to you.

161
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,113
Yes, it is! Wait and see.

162
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:50,743
Gang-mu, that bastard…

163
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,823
<i>I'll teach him a proper lesson this time.</i>

164
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,423
I'm going to Nam Mountain.

165
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:07,923
Get the car ready.

166
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:15,393
You can't pull that out.
If you do, we'll all die.

167
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:21,983
Hold on.

168
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,203
If you move, it'll explode.

169
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:41,373
Don't move.

170
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,843
Oh, no.

171
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:48,423
Stay still.

172
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,303
Don't move.

173
00:18:24,663 --> 00:18:25,503
Move!

174
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,043
Keep your heads down!

175
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:30,883
Keep your heads down!

176
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:32,303
Stay in line.

177
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,343
-Move faster.
-Stay in line!

178
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:38,643
What? There's more?

179
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,183
Move faster!

180
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,273
Keep up!

181
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,163
Go in a single line.

182
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,543
Eyes on the head
of the person in front of you.

183
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,253
Move faster. Keep up.

184
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:08,713
Move it.

185
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:11,883
In a single line.

186
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:13,763
Keep your heads down.

187
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,393
Walk.

188
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:23,683
Hey, you!

189
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,063
Keep up.

190
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:26,943
Keep your heads down!

191
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:28,903
Keep your heads down.

192
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,443
Move it, you bastard.

193
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:38,703
Put your head on the wall.

194
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,323
Now, you bastard.

195
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,703
Stay quiet with your head down.

196
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,433
I can't find Ms. Pi.

197
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,273
Has anyone seen the hall director?

198
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:12,313
Maybe she ran alone to save her skin.

199
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,943
-Seriously? No way.
-She abandoned us?

200
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,863
What do we do?

201
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:18,363
Quiet!

202
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,453
Lim Soo-ho!

203
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,253
Drop the guns in three seconds,
or she's dead.

204
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:37,673
Ms. Pi.

205
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,683
Hey!

206
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:46,723
Who are you?

207
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,393
What's this?

208
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,353
Are you sure you searched thoroughly?

209
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,823
Yes, I searched every floor.

210
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:58,443
Where have you been?

211
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,153
I'm the hall director here.

212
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:04,623
Do you think you guys know
about this building better than I do?

213
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,163
Shut up!

214
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,583
You little…

215
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,883
Ms. Pi.

216
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:21,303
Ms. Pi.

217
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,053
Hush. Stop crying
and pull yourselves together.

218
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:28,103
Even spider webs can become
really strong when put together.

219
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,563
Keep in line!

220
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,193
You.

221
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:34,943
And you.

222
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:38,403
-Move!
-You.

223
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,903
Keep your heads down!

224
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:42,953
Stand by the windows.

225
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,743
Why? Why do they
have to stand by the windows?

226
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,703
Shut your mouth.

227
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,163
Don't be scared.

228
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:54,673
They're making you stand by the windows
so that they won't be attacked.

229
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:56,713
Hey.

230
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:58,923
You think that'll keep you safe?

231
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,093
You obviously stand no chance.

232
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:05,133
Since it's a counterespionage op,
military forces will be sent here.

233
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,183
It will be hundreds of
special forces soldiers…

234
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:11,563
and just three of you.

235
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:15,023
On top of that, you're injured.

236
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,943
Are you sure you can even hold out?

237
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,823
Wouldn't it be better to just surrender?

238
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:42,343
You're the one who shot me, aren't you?

239
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,893
If anything goes wrong,
I'll kill you first.

240
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,693
Stand by the windows!

241
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,563
You three! Move!

242
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,113
Move!

243
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:06,743
You stand over there!

244
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:09,453
Don't look back.

245
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,493
From now on,
I'll kill anyone who annoys me.

246
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:16,543
Understood?

247
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,143
<i>Hostages?</i>

248
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:31,353
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

249
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,313
In the Hosu University dorm?

250
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:35,483
<i>Yes.</i>

251
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:40,153
I thought it'd be impossible for
13 people to die unless war broke out.

252
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:44,233
<i>What if 13 young virgins really die?</i>

253
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:46,573
Watch what you say!

254
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,953
<i>They're holding students hostage.</i>

255
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:50,783
Shouldn't you be more worried about them?

256
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,283
How could someone in your position
say that?

257
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:55,873
I…

258
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,623
I apologize, ma'am.

259
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:01,963
I just thought
someone charismatic and noble like you

260
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:05,383
should be the future First Lady.

261
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:09,013
I was just worried, Ms. Cho.

262
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:11,473
<i>No, you got it wrong. Just wrong!</i>

263
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:13,933
It's not important for me
to become the First Lady.

264
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:17,853
What's important is
for my husband to become president.

265
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,813
<i>You better stop being so thoughtless,</i>

266
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:22,563
or I'll switch shops!

267
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:27,903
Wait a minute.

268
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:34,833
What the…

269
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:38,873
Both of them must take me for a pushover.

270
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,333
This is so annoying.

271
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:54,013
PATIENT TRANSPORT

272
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:55,223
Close it.

273
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,223
MILITARY OPERATION
DO NOT CROSS

274
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,523
-Step back.
-What's going on?

275
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:02,403
Are my roommates okay?

276
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:03,863
Then we can't go into the form?

277
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:05,573
No, a military op is being carried out.

278
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,443
So please just go home

279
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:09,743
and wait until further notice.

280
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,953
Hey, wait! Tell us what's going on?

281
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:17,873
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:19,123
Did you meet Yeong-ro?

283
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:20,663
Are you with her now?

284
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,623
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

285
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:23,333
I see.

286
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:26,543
Then she must be still in the dorm, right?

287
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:29,963
I'm aware of that.

288
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,593
Don't worry, and just come back here.

289
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:39,563
<i>How dare they attack the university dorm?</i>

290
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:41,733
<i>Hosu Women's University</i>

291
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:43,903
is where our chairman's daughter--

292
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:54,323
This is Mr. Kim. Are you there, Galaxy?

293
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:55,913
Galaxy standing by.

294
00:25:56,323 --> 00:26:00,123
<i>Among the hostages, there's a freshman
English Literature major named Eun…</i>

295
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:02,873
Eun… Yes, Yeong-ro.

296
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,583
Check if Eun Yeong-ro is in there.

297
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:09,503
We're still putting together a list.
We must take out the takers first!

298
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:11,633
She's Mr. Eun's daughter.

299
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,133
<i>Let me know once confirmed.</i>

300
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,183
And stand by for now. Over.

301
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:34,153
Hang in there, Mr. Lee.

302
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:39,373
What are we waiting for?
We must rescue Mr. Lee.

303
00:26:40,873 --> 00:26:43,873
Go check if there's an Eun Yeong-ro
among the hostages.

304
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:46,083
Eun Yeong-ro?

305
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:47,463
Who is that?

306
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:50,543
Number one's daughter. Mr. Eun's daughter.

307
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,923
God, this is crazy.

308
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,673
If they find out, we'll be in trouble.

309
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,553
We should extract her before they do.

310
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,843
First, keep it confidential
over the radio.

311
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,853
And get a secure line to the dorm.
A line directly from HQ too.

312
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:03,143
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,023
And wiretap the whole building.

314
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:13,283
Ammunitions go over there.

315
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,073
Hurry up!

316
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,963
<i>Three hostages by the windows.</i>

317
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:35,263
There are booby traps everywhere,
so it won't be easy to penetrate.

318
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:39,763
<i>All units, stand by. There are explosives.</i>

319
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:43,103
So the Northern team Taedong River 1 leads

320
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:46,563
just left the Port of Incheon
with Professor Han?

321
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,103
Finally!

322
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,313
As soon as he arrives in the North,

323
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,983
our ship carrying 100 million dollars

324
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,323
will head for Whiskey, November,

325
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:59,613
<i>two, zero, two, three,
one, four, eight, one.</i>

326
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,873
It'll rendezvous with your men.

327
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:05,453
As soon as we receive the money,

328
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:08,833
we'll make Professor Han
officially disclose

329
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:11,583
that the opposition party
is running for president

330
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,713
with our great Supreme Leader's funding.

331
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:17,263
You demanded four times
the original price for Operation Phoenix.

332
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,093
You already got 100 million dollars.

333
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:23,933
And you'll get 100 million more
once the ship gets there. As for the rest,

334
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,523
we'll send it to you
once you hold the press conference.

335
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:32,233
After the election is over,
feel free to come visit me.

336
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:37,403
If you want to hold the position for long,
you should visit here at least once.

337
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:40,243
If I visit there myself, it'll look bad.

338
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:43,163
Anyway, we'll be waiting for good news.

339
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:50,293
It wouldn't hurt to be in close touch with
them. Why did you have to

340
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,253
turn it down so coldly?

341
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,503
It's almost done.

342
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:58,343
Once Han appears on Korean Central TV,
the game's over.

343
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:01,053
We've jumped through hoops for this,

344
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,723
so let's have nice dinner tonight.

345
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:05,433
We'll pop the champagne a bit early.

346
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,143
-Let's go.
-Sure.

347
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:08,853
Mr. Eun.

348
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:11,103
Mr. An wants to talk to you.

349
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:12,523
Chief An?

350
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:17,483
Let him in.

351
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:21,703
I wonder why that dung fly
came to see you.

352
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:33,213
Sir.

353
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:35,133
What is it?

354
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:37,253
In the Hosu University dorm,

355
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,343
Northern spies are holding people hostage.

356
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,303
A hostage situation?

357
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:45,183
Lee Gang-mu disobeyed your direct orders

358
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,973
and raided the dorm with military forces.

359
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:50,023
Wait. Are you sure they're spies?

360
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:53,523
According to intercepted radio messages,
he must've been sure of it.

361
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:56,483
How dare those communists make a mess
here in this day and age?

362
00:29:56,563 --> 00:30:00,193
Call CFC right now and
mobilize all the Capital Defense forces!

363
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:03,243
Tell them to squash them without trace!

364
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,743
But I don't think
Gang-mu went there without a good reason.

365
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:12,003
Well, he went there
to catch Taedong River 1.

366
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,713
But Taedong River 1 just left Incheon…

367
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,303
So the students are being held hostage?

368
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:25,133
What do you keep asking him for?

369
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,513
What if articles are released

370
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,053
that say Northern spies are
holding students hostage?

371
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,103
People will be shocked.

372
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:34,773
We've put all this together, but if this
gets out, it'll all be for nothing.

373
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,813
We must be in the spotlight!

374
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:39,323
What if we suppress them by force
and the students get hurt?

375
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,363
Will you take responsibility?

376
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,703
Why are you so slow?

377
00:30:45,783 --> 00:30:49,203
What I'm saying is
Han's press conference must happen first!

378
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,953
Anyway, it's under my jurisdiction,

379
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:53,123
so go pop the champagne by yourself.

380
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,963
This is exactly your problem!

381
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,713
You always dilly-dally,
and that's a liability to us!

382
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:04,473
If our plan goes wrong,

383
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:06,343
it's all on you.

384
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,723
I understand.

385
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:21,943
It's me.

386
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,483
Is Yeong-ro there?

387
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,993
I sent Mr. Kim to pick her up at the dorm,

388
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:31,243
<i>but he couldn't even go near the dorm,
so he's coming back without her.</i>

389
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,793
What if something happens to Yeong-ro?

390
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:36,543
She'll be okay, right?

391
00:31:36,623 --> 00:31:38,873
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

392
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:40,923
Okay.

393
00:31:58,443 --> 00:31:59,563
Sir,

394
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,903
it's been confirmed

395
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:04,613
that your daughter is
being held hostage too.

396
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,193
Are you sure?

397
00:32:07,243 --> 00:32:11,573
We've been keeping an eye on her
since she started college as Choi asked.

398
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,583
And upon hearing about the hostage
situation, we checked it first.

399
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:27,213
I swear on my life
that I'll rescue your daughter first.

400
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:30,723
Once the Capital Defense forces mobilize,
the press will find out.

401
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:33,013
Rescue all of the students

402
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,513
and kill

403
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:37,523
the spies if necessary.

404
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,313
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,483
We'll be discreet

406
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,483
and take care of it
without anyone knowing.

407
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,403
Also, sir…

408
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:54,533
On top of

409
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:58,413
disobeying your orders and
acting rashly to catch Taedong River 1,

410
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:02,213
Gang-mu's been shot
and is now being held hostage.

411
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:05,923
The way I see it,
Gang-mu is solely responsible for this--

412
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:06,883
Hurry.

413
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:09,303
It's not the time to decide
who's responsible.

414
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:10,973
You're right. Right away, sir.

415
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,473
-I will save your daughter!
-Get out!

416
00:33:58,853 --> 00:33:59,813
Keep your eyes shut!

417
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,933
Keep them shut!

418
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,903
Don't come out of the curtain.

419
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:24,083
It's all your fault. This wouldn't be
happening if you hadn't hidden that spy!

420
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:28,503
That spy was Yeong-ro's partner, right?

421
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:31,763
Then has she known he was a spy all along?

422
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:33,553
Of course, she has.

423
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:36,303
They're dating after all.

424
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:39,763
Shut your mouth and stop talking nonsense.

425
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:41,523
Why is it nonsense?

426
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:43,523
I was right all along.

427
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,693
You should've let me call the cops.

428
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:47,563
It's not the time
to decide who's to blame.

429
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,523
Just think about how to get out safely.

430
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:51,863
Safely?

431
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:55,613
We might all end up dying in here!

432
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:57,533
Who is it?

433
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:00,123
Who's crying?

434
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:02,203
Be quiet.

435
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:08,043
Excuse me.

436
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,503
I need to go to the bathroom.

437
00:35:10,593 --> 00:35:11,673
Me too.

438
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,513
Excuse me.

439
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:23,143
What is it?

440
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,563
Could I go to the bathroom?

441
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:29,523
I need to, too.

442
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:31,193
Don't.

443
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:43,373
Shouldn't we

444
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,163
let them go to the bathroom at least?

445
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:51,843
Close your eyes unless you want to die!

446
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:54,883
Close your eyes!

447
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,843
Look. It's a natural process.

448
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,643
How are we supposed to hold it?

449
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,853
I told you to shut it!

450
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,613
Do it. Do it here!

451
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,663
It's all your fault.

452
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,533
What on earth is going on?

453
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:09,753
Don't tell me you're the Northern spy.

454
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:11,543
A Northern spy?

455
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,303
Goodness, they say
you can't judge a book by its cover.

456
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:22,433
Are you really
a spy from the North? Tell me.

457
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,473
Then Yeong-ro's been fooled too?

458
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,143
How do you know this spy?

459
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:36,193
What kind of trouble
did you get yourself into?

460
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:38,363
You're the one
getting in trouble all the time!

461
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:41,403
-Goodness.
-Hey.

462
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,453
I don't know what happened
between you two,

463
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,833
but I have nothing to do with it.

464
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:51,373
So please let me go. Then I'll go back

465
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,963
the way I came very quietly.

466
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:04,133
Okay.

467
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,563
So if you'd just sent me the money,
I wouldn't have had to come here!

468
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:18,823
Close your eyes.

469
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:21,403
Breathe quietly.

470
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:33,793
Excuse me.

471
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:38,503
What?

472
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:40,753
He's bleeding.

473
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:44,223
Can I just stop the bleeding?

474
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:51,563
Are you crazy?

475
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:02,323
Lie back down.

476
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:07,243
Lie down!

477
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,493
He's bleeding. Let me stop it.

478
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,003
Shut up and lie down.

479
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,373
Eun Yeong-ro.

480
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:24,513
My God, what's going on?

481
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:27,723
Oh, my. What's happening?

482
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:30,643
My goodness.

483
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:37,733
Comrade.

484
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:45,693
What are you doing?

485
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:48,913
She wouldn't listen to me.

486
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,453
He's hurt.

487
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,123
Can't you see him bleeding?

488
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:55,953
We should give him first aid at least.

489
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,303
Let me go get the first aid kit.

490
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:06,923
-Are you crazy? Sit down!
-Wait.

491
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:13,603
You're hurt too.

492
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:20,773
Lead the way.

493
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:45,693
Are you really a spy

494
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:48,283
from the North?

495
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:54,743
Did I really

496
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,413
save a spy's life?

497
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:17,603
I'm warning you.

498
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,063
Stop being so nosy.

499
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:28,943
Or you'll get yourself killed.

500
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:01,973
Mr. Eun,

501
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,603
the man leading the hostage situation
in the dorm

502
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,353
is Taedong River 1.

503
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:08,733
Are you sure it's him?

504
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,023
What's the status?

505
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:13,823
Okay.

506
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:26,713
Put me through to Mr. Nam…

507
00:43:27,753 --> 00:43:30,173
No, never mind.

508
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:34,803
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

509
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:54,443
<i>This is Pyongyang.</i>

510
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:55,863
Go ahead.

511
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:57,573
Mr. Lim.

512
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:02,203
I hear Taedong River 1 is holding people
hostage in the middle of Seoul.

513
00:44:02,783 --> 00:44:04,663
<i>Are you sure he's with Professor Han</i>

514
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,503
right now?

515
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,043
What is this?

516
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,963
<i>Why does this kind of thing
happen every time?</i>

517
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:14,053
He was supposed to join the others
after retrieving our weapons.

518
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,963
<i>Your men must've chased him!</i>

519
00:44:16,463 --> 00:44:18,343
Can't you do your job properly?

520
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:21,183
You are one to talk!

521
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:24,563
This is the Republic of Korea.

522
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:27,183
Did you think our agents
would just get out of the way?

523
00:44:27,273 --> 00:44:29,893
He should've been good enough
to give our agents the slip.

524
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:31,603
Look, Eun!

525
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:34,983
<i>Don't try to turn this around on me!
How dare you!</i>

526
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:38,493
If you even lay a finger on our agents,

527
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:41,033
the deal is off!
Forget about the election!

528
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:45,793
Do everything in your power to get Taedong
River 1 out and send him to the North.

529
00:44:45,873 --> 00:44:49,753
<i>To us, he's more important
than the president of South Korea!</i>

530
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,173
Understood?

531
00:45:14,063 --> 00:45:16,443
<i>So Soo-hyeok's been captured?</i>

532
00:45:29,503 --> 00:45:30,373
Did you call for me?

533
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:32,713
We'll head for Hosu University
in a minute.

534
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:34,003
With a full security detail.

535
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,673
<i>Eun Chang-su himself?</i>

536
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:39,963
But why? They're just small-fry spies.

537
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:42,973
His daughter is in the dorm?

538
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:44,593
After falling for his new wife,

539
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:47,223
he sent his son to the army
and daughter to the dorm.

540
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:49,603
What a funny guy he is.

541
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:52,483
But still,

542
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,983
he's the director of ANSP.

543
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:56,903
How could he go to the scene himself?

544
00:45:57,403 --> 00:46:01,153
He should be pushing his agents to rescue
the others first. What the hell is he…

545
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:07,333
What?

546
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,623
Are you sure it's Taedong River 1?

547
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:18,883
Okay.

548
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:23,173
Keep me posted on Eun's every move.
All right.

549
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:26,853
I need a shirt.

550
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:28,473
Where's my shirt?

551
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:30,273
Darn it.

552
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,353
He didn't even report to me on it.

553
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:39,363
God damn it! Those damn communists
can't do anything right!

554
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:40,573
Damn it.

555
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,443
Do you have to go too?

556
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:46,323
Well, I don't have to…

557
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:49,083
No! Get it together!
I have to go! Where's my jacket?

558
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:50,293
My jacket!

559
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:02,923
You're the one who hid him, aren't you?

560
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:14,273
I'm sorry. I swear I didn't know then.

561
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:20,363
Don't be. It's all right.

562
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:26,453
You didn't know.

563
00:47:26,783 --> 00:47:30,073
Helping without knowing
doesn't count as harboring a spy.

564
00:47:56,683 --> 00:47:58,143
Oh, no.

565
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:05,243
Does it hurt a lot?

566
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:07,783
Oh, no.

567
00:48:43,313 --> 00:48:44,653
Close your eyes!

568
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:51,363
Hey.

569
00:48:52,373 --> 00:48:53,623
Taedong River 1.

570
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:58,663
So this is how we finally meet.

571
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:05,043
To catch you,
I've been to Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt,

572
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,553
and Warsaw.

573
00:49:08,763 --> 00:49:11,183
In Warsaw,
I almost died while chasing you.

574
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:18,563
Hey, stop right there!

575
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:20,483
Stop!

576
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:29,033
Stop right there!

577
00:50:09,283 --> 00:50:10,743
You're a veteran.

578
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,743
Isn't losing Park Geum-cheol enough?

579
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:17,703
Do you want to lose the rest
while fighting a losing battle?

580
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:21,833
You must've only fought winning battles.

581
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:28,343
You see, I have so many things
I want to hear from you.

582
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,843
I have to avenge Jin-seong's death too.

583
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:36,433
But I'm so worried
that the military forces

584
00:50:37,053 --> 00:50:38,683
might kill you

585
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:41,933
before I could do any of that.

586
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,963
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED

587
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:12,133
<i>Not to break in?</i>

588
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:16,383
Yes, sir. We won't break in rashly.

589
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,593
It might take quite long,
but we must kill--

590
00:51:18,683 --> 00:51:21,813
You can't kill them.
All three of them must be unscathed.

591
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,103
Capture them no matter what.

592
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:26,813
I see. I understand, sir.

593
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:30,403
What's going on?

594
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:33,693
Why must the spies be unscathed?

595
00:51:36,823 --> 00:51:40,873
We need to rescue his daughter
and the spies too? I mean, capture them.

596
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,953
Looks like we're the only ones suffering.

597
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:49,923
-Hello, sir.
-Open it!

598
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:52,303
We'll break in from these three points.

599
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:53,423
Hello, sir.

600
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:05,813
It's been 3 hours and 18 minutes
since he was shot. 3 hours and 18 minutes!

601
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,023
You think I've been slacking off?

602
00:52:08,103 --> 00:52:10,613
I ran over here
as soon as I reported to Mr. Eun.

603
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,073
Let's break in right away.

604
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:15,743
There are just three of them,
and one is injured--

605
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:16,653
That's enough!

606
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:19,203
Attention.

607
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:21,783
From now on,

608
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,583
I'll lead

609
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:25,953
the operation.

610
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:30,373
Anything about this operation
can't get out of here.

611
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,543
So make sure not to let the press

612
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:34,423
release any articles about gunfire

613
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:36,843
or a women's university dormitory.

614
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:38,473
Yes, sir.

615
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:40,303
This operation's

616
00:52:41,643 --> 00:52:43,013
top priority

617
00:52:43,603 --> 00:52:45,683
is to rescue our director's daughter.

618
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:46,933
So right now,

619
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:50,813
set up a field phone in front of
the dorm and get me a megaphone.

620
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:52,863
Get me a bulletproof vest.

621
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:03,663
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

622
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,453
<i>Lim Soo-ho. Can you hear me?</i>

623
00:53:16,003 --> 00:53:19,763
<i>I'm the person in charge of this scene.</i>

624
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:23,473
<i>We just put a field phone
in front of the front door of the dorm.</i>

625
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:29,433
<i>From now on, I'm the only person</i>

626
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:31,443
<i>you can talk to.</i>

627
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:34,863
<i>Lim Soo-ho. I know you're listening.</i>

628
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:38,073
He's like a scared street dog.

629
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:40,613
<i>I am a man of my word.</i>

630
00:53:41,203 --> 00:53:42,283
<i>If you guarantee</i>

631
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:44,493
<i>the hostages' safety,</i>

632
00:53:45,163 --> 00:53:46,993
<i>we'll guarantee your safety</i>

633
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,743
<i>at all costs.</i>

634
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,253
We must negotiate with them
to get out of here.

635
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,543
<i>I repeat.</i>

636
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:55,543
<i>Right now,</i>

637
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:56,923
I need you to cover me.

638
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:59,133
<i>come pick up the field phone</i>

639
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:02,013
<i>and talk with me to negotiate.</i>

640
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:07,473
Is there any response?

641
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:09,933
Not yet.

642
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:12,693
I don't think I can hold it anymore.

643
00:54:15,403 --> 00:54:17,523
You have to. Hang in there.

644
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:20,483
I need to pee. My goodness.

645
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:23,823
Hey, how about
you pee in your pants little by little?

646
00:54:23,903 --> 00:54:25,493
Or just wet your pants.

647
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:26,703
It's all right.

648
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,123
-It's not embarrassing.
-Should I?

649
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:30,913
The grenade.

650
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:33,663
There's a grenade.

651
00:54:35,293 --> 00:54:37,003
No… No!

652
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:38,463
-I shouldn't move! No!
-Wait!

653
00:54:39,383 --> 00:54:40,503
No!

654
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:52,773
Oh, my.

655
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:01,613
You bastard! Why did you pee on me?

656
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:12,793
You.

657
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:16,713
Go to the front door.

658
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:29,853
Go with him.

659
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,103
Stay here.

660
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:39,273
Yes, sir.

661
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:53,793
God damn it! That prick!

662
00:55:54,373 --> 00:55:55,583
<i>Right now,</i>

663
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,713
<i>come pick up the field phone.</i>

664
00:55:58,213 --> 00:55:59,383
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

665
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:01,633
<i>I am warning you again…</i>

666
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:12,723
You'll see a phone outside.

667
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:14,183
Go fetch it.

668
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:18,063
Pardon?

669
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:20,733
You mean, me?

670
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:25,993
Do anything stupid,
and your girlfriend dies.

671
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:32,783
Gwang-tae.

672
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:37,873
I love you.

673
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:41,173
You're the only one for me.

674
00:56:41,753 --> 00:56:42,843
You know that, right?

675
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:44,753
It won't be that hard.

676
00:56:44,843 --> 00:56:47,383
Just walk slowly there and bring it here.

677
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:48,513
Okay?

678
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:50,973
Go fetch it now!

679
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,263
Now.

680
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:06,823
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED

681
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:13,573
Someone's coming out.

682
00:57:14,283 --> 00:57:15,833
Raise your shields.

683
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,263
That's not Lim Soo-ho.

684
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:36,263
I think he's a student.

685
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:39,643
<i>All right.</i>

686
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:41,893
<i>Don't worry.</i>

687
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:45,823
<i>We will not shoot you.</i>

688
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:48,033
<i>Slowly,</i>

689
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:50,363
<i>take the phone and go back inside.</i>

690
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:03,253
Gwang-tae, come on!

691
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,973
Lim Soo-ho's behind the door.

692
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:19,893
Really?

693
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:09,109
Who fired the gun? Who was it?

694
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:23,669
Hold fire!

695
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:34,089
We shouldn't shoot them.
Order them not to fire back.

696
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:40,889
Raise it! And get down. Lower your body!

697
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,349
Raise the shields!

698
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:43,689
Don't shoot.

699
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:44,899
Tell them not to fire back.

700
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:47,149
We shouldn't fire back. Hold fire!

701
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,029
Pick it up now.

702
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,569
Raise the shields!

703
00:59:57,779 --> 00:59:59,949
All right. Pull back!

704
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,749
-Pull back!
-Pull back!

705
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:04,959
Protect me! God damn it.
Keep the shields close!

706
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,169
-Pull back! Hurry up!
-Block me!

707
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:23,019
-Sir, you should wear the vest.
-Out of my way!

708
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:33,939
Do you have a death wish or something?

709
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:36,819
Look. I know you're desperate,

710
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:37,819
but are you crazy?

711
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:40,529
I know you don't care
about Mr. Lee at all.

712
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,659
It was the perfect chance to get him.

713
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:45,789
Once we get him, the other two will--

714
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:46,829
What if!

715
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:49,749
What if the other two shoot the hostages?

716
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:53,129
And what if Mr. Eun's daughter dies?
What will you do?

717
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,629
Are you the one who shot at them?

718
01:00:57,299 --> 01:01:01,179
No, I'm not, sir. It was Han-na.
She was trying to save Gang-mu.

719
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:06,599
Don't you know our agents must put

720
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:09,439
our people's lives
before our colleagues' lives?

721
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:17,489
Jang Han-na,
you're banned from this scene.

722
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:21,279
Until ordered otherwise,
go stay in the office.

723
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:22,909
Mr. Eun. Sir!

724
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:24,909
I'll be expelled if I have to.

725
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:26,659
But let me stay at the scene.

726
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,669
Please! Let me stay here!

727
01:01:28,749 --> 01:01:30,129
-Get her out!
-Mr. Eun!

728
01:01:30,209 --> 01:01:31,419
Mr. Eun!

729
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:32,999
Mr. Eun!

730
01:01:36,419 --> 01:01:37,259
Sir.

731
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:41,299
I risked being sniped at

732
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:43,759
to give them a field phone--

733
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:45,139
Everyone, out!

734
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:47,349
Get up, guys.

735
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:53,859
Why? Will you take care of it by yourself?

736
01:01:57,569 --> 01:01:59,569
Were you going to handle it

737
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:01,779
without even telling me?

738
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:05,699
That bastard's supposed
to be on the West Sea now.

739
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:07,659
But why is he in the dorm?

740
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:09,789
Explain.

741
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,309
My stomach…

742
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:32,399
My stomach hurts.

743
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:34,809
Yeong-ro, what's wrong?

744
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:36,269
Yeong-ro.

745
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:40,319
Didn't I say I'd kill you
if you said anything?

746
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,159
Look. She says she's in pain.

747
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:45,659
How could you do that--

748
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:48,119
Didn't you hear the gunfire earlier?

749
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:50,539
Your stomach hurts?

750
01:02:51,459 --> 01:02:53,879
Are you faking pain
even after hearing gunfire?

751
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:57,879
Answer me!

752
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:01,049
Are you seriously faking it?

753
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:10,769
My back! My back hurts too.

754
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:13,769
No, I'm okay. Don't worry.

755
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:15,979
Gosh.

756
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:23,569
I'm fine. It's because
I've been lying down for so long.

757
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:25,279
Come in.

758
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:45,049
Why did they get changed?

759
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:50,469
Aren't they Seol-hui's pajamas?

760
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:55,349
-Look at them.
-What's with them?

761
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:56,599
Don't laugh.

762
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,529
We almost died.

763
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,829
We need to kill one of the hostages now.

764
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:21,499
Just wait.

765
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,599
<i>This is the director of ANSP.</i>

766
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,899
Am I speaking to Lim Soo-ho?

767
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:43,229
You suggested talking then fired a gun?

768
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:45,649
It was a mistake.
We didn't mean to shoot you.

769
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:46,909
A mistake?

770
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,409
Listen very carefully.

771
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,999
<i>One of the hostages will die right now.</i>

772
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:57,999
Because you made a mistake.

773
01:04:58,499 --> 01:05:00,339
<i>Aren't you supposed to rendezvous</i>

774
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:01,919
at Yankee, Mike,

775
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:03,799
six, two, one, four,

776
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,339
<i>seven, one, two, eight?</i>

777
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:09,969
<i>Don't worry.</i>

778
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:12,969
Your agents will accomplish
their mission without a problem.

779
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,689
The person in charge who sent you guys
to Seoul is director Lim Ji-rok, right?

780
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:23,689
<i>If that's true, just trust me.</i>

781
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:24,979
<i>We have no intention</i>

782
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:26,689
of harming you.

783
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:29,489
We want to send
all of you back to the North safely.

784
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:34,239
Exactly 30 minutes from now,

785
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:36,999
come out through an emergency exit
in basement two.

786
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:57,229
What did those bastards say?

787
01:05:59,139 --> 01:06:01,439
To come out through an emergency exit
in 30 minutes.

788
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:04,229
They say they'll send us
back to the North safely.

789
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:08,239
How can we ever trust those bastards?

790
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,949
I'll have to check if it's true first.

791
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,069
Do you really need to check to know?

792
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:13,659
It's obviously a trap.

793
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:27,879
It must be a put-up job, right?

794
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:31,549
"They're supposed
to be on the West Sea now,

795
01:06:31,629 --> 01:06:34,259
but why are they in the dorm?"

796
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,599
And he said
something will all be for nothing.

797
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,689
On top of that, he ordered me to capture
them, saying they must be unscathed.

798
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:42,899
You're right.

799
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:46,899
Eun Chang-su must've arranged something
with the North secretly for the election.

800
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:48,939
<i>What do I do?</i>

801
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:51,649
It's against the National Security Law
not to investigate

802
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:54,319
when I'm aware of the charges.

803
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:58,579
Of course, Code 1 must've ordered them!

804
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:00,329
<i>God, you're so frustrating.</i>

805
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:02,329
Why are you so slow?

806
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:04,169
I mean,

807
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:06,339
how much longer

808
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:08,839
<i>will you stay an errand boy?</i>

809
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:13,089
And how much longer
must I stay a maid for them?

810
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:17,679
I don't know!

811
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:21,059
Whether or not you save Eun's daughter,
I don't care!

812
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:22,099
Charlotte.

813
01:07:22,769 --> 01:07:23,849
Charlotte?

814
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:27,229
What is it, Ms. Kim?

815
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:33,239
"Whether or not you save Eun's daughter"?

816
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:36,529
What does that mean?

817
01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:41,159
I guess you haven't heard yet.

818
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:43,329
Mr. Eun's daughter

819
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:46,999
is being held hostage
in the Hosu University dorm.

820
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:49,249
Oh, my God.

821
01:07:50,669 --> 01:07:51,509
Really?

822
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:57,049
Then he must be desperate
to save his daughter,

823
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,219
forgetting about becoming president.

824
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:00,969
Yes.

825
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:05,349
Ms. Hong must be really anxious right now.

826
01:08:05,439 --> 01:08:07,939
She can neither stop him
nor encourage him.

827
01:08:08,979 --> 01:08:09,819
You're right.

828
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:13,739
I should go comfort her.

829
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:16,529
Cancel today's mahjong game.

830
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:18,279
Pardon?

831
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:25,039
What are you doing? Come with me.

832
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,999
Right. Of course.

833
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:19,279
If this song plays on Pyongyang channel,
it means the instruction has changed.

834
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,859
Remember that and obey the new order.

835
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:45,009
<i>I will read out the 2,204th message.</i>

836
01:10:45,099 --> 01:10:46,349
<i>Assistant Team Six.</i>

837
01:10:46,429 --> 01:10:49,349
<i>This is a message for Assistant Team Six.</i>

838
01:10:49,519 --> 01:10:52,269
<i>76,373.</i>

839
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:57,359
<i>20,100. 36,116.</i>

840
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:00,699
<i>59,789.</i>

841
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:06,079
<i>40,251. 20,073. That'll be all.</i>

842
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:27,639
COOPERATE

843
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:32,389
WITH

844
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:40,109
SOUTH KOREA

845
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:55,499
The potatoes from our hometown
are the best.

846
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:57,379
Those from the South are too soft.

847
01:11:57,879 --> 01:12:00,089
Would you like some potatoes?

848
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:02,209
Have some.

849
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:10,599
<i>I keep having diarrhea.</i>

850
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:14,479
Yeong-u.

851
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:20,269
Yeong-u.

852
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:22,609
Switch shifts for me just this once.

853
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,529
-Oh, my.
-God, you punk.

854
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:30,529
REPUBLIC OF KOREA MARINES

855
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,659
You're an administrative clerk,
but you want to be on a coast patrol boat?

856
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:36,579
Private Kim isn't feeling well.

857
01:12:36,669 --> 01:12:39,039
So I'll fill in for him.

858
01:12:39,419 --> 01:12:40,589
Really?

859
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:42,799
Okay, then. Be safe.

860
01:12:43,379 --> 01:12:45,379
Salute.

861
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,799
Salute.

862
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:59,729
I thought he was just one of those who
have powerful dads, but he's quite nice.

863
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:04,029
His father may be the director of ANSP,
but he's a Marine just like any of us.

864
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,359
<i>It's impossible
the party has given such an order.</i>

865
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:10,159
But it's true that
the Pyongyang channel told us

866
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,489
to cooperate with the South.

867
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:14,619
The broadcasting might've been fabricated.

868
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:17,919
They shot at us after suggesting talking.

869
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:19,999
What if this is another trap?

870
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:25,799
As you say, it might be a trap they set.

871
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:29,969
But what if it is the party's instruction?

872
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:34,809
If we disobey the orders,
it won't stop at our deaths.

873
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:37,689
Our families in our hometown
will suffer too.

874
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:41,439
You still want to
ignore their instructions?

875
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:47,529
The director of ANSP knew
the coordinates of our rendezvous point,

876
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:51,319
as well as the person
in charge of this mission.

877
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,829
But how could he have found out?

878
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:58,119
Our country must've made a deal with him

879
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:00,829
to save our lives.

880
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:08,299
As you know,
our party would never abandon us.

881
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:10,929
Understood, sir.

882
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:13,349
I'll do as you say

883
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:14,599
no matter what.

884
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:31,199
SERVING WINDOW

885
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,739
Exactly 15 minutes from now,
we'll escape through the emergency exit.

886
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:53,969
It's too foggy to see anyone coming.
Will we even be able to meet?

887
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:20,369
Isn't it time?

888
01:15:26,919 --> 01:15:28,669
-They're coming.
-Good.

889
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:34,299
The sound is different.

890
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:43,479
Reporting.

891
01:15:43,559 --> 01:15:44,519
Checking the reception.

892
01:15:44,599 --> 01:15:46,359
Wild Goose 2, this is Stone 1. Over.

893
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,319
Stone 1, this is Wild Goose 2. Clear.

894
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,189
Wild Goose 2,
we'll proceed with reception, over.

895
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,739
We pulled back the SWAT team

896
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:58,909
and only placed your security detail
in front of the exit.

897
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:00,659
As soon as they come out,

898
01:16:00,739 --> 01:16:03,039
we'll get them into the car
and get out of here.

899
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:04,869
-Yes, sir.
-Hey.

900
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:06,669
Do you think they'll come out?

901
01:16:06,749 --> 01:16:09,669
Do you really think so?
I wouldn't trust you if I were them.

902
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:10,629
Don't you think?

903
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:25,019
<i>There must be no one in front of the exit.</i>

904
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:27,399
Pull back all of your guys.

905
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:30,149
We'll come out through the exit
in exactly three minutes.

906
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,359
Good. They'll come out in three minutes.

907
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:38,279
Yes, sir.

908
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:42,999
Gosh, you're so lucky, Eun.

909
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:45,749
We avoided the worst-case scenario.

910
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:49,999
I'm glad we're putting an end
to this case safely.

911
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:52,169
Deepest congratulations, sir.

912
01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:07,689
<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

913
01:17:07,769 --> 01:17:10,559
<i>-Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>
-Damn it!

914
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:13,689
<i>Your ship is in the restricted area.</i>

915
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:16,319

<i>Please go back to the fishery zone now.</i>

922
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:36,919
This is the restricted area!

923
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:41,799
We know that. Our engine
broke down, so we've been drifting here.

924
01:17:42,299 --> 01:17:44,309
Hey, go check if it's working now.

925
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:45,389
Okay.

926
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:48,189
We're almost done, so we'll leave soon.

927
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:49,139
Sorry.

928
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:52,229
-Report that it's a Korean boat.
-Yes, sir.

929
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:54,779
-At ease.
-At ease.

930
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,489
It's done. It's been fixed. We'll go now.

931
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:01,819
Thank you.

932
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:02,739
Do you need help?

933
01:18:02,829 --> 01:18:04,539
No, it's been fixed.

934
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:06,079
-Get ready.
-Okay.

935
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,959
Hey! Come back in here!

936
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:10,749
Damn it.

937
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,549
Help me! Please!

938
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:19,549
Help me! Please!

939
01:18:41,069 --> 01:18:42,409
Signalman!

940
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:44,909
Pull back!

941
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:46,039
Hurry!

942
01:20:25,259 --> 01:20:26,259
<i>What?</i>

943
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:29,139
An engagement near Udo Island?

944
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:34,059
Udo Island?

945
01:20:34,809 --> 01:20:36,229
What's the exact location?

946
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:39,689
What about the damage on our side?

947
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:43,149
Okay. Get back to me
as soon as you find out more.

948
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:45,069
Wait. This can't be…

949
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:46,529
It must not be

950
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,239
the ship for the spies, right?

951
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:52,999
Our ship hit and sank it.

952
01:20:58,459 --> 01:20:59,709
God damn it!

953
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:15,929
Now…

954
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,229
Plan B is the only option now.

955
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:27,529
They're coming.

956
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:33,699
Everyone, retreat.

957
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:19,599
Stop.

958
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:07,439
Eung-cheol!

959
01:24:07,649 --> 01:24:08,729
Are you okay?

960
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:24,579
<i>We must kill them all.</i>

961
01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:26,119
Are you telling me to commit murder?

962
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:29,169
No, no. It's not murder. It's execution.

963
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:31,209
<i>To shoot all the hostages dead</i>

964
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:34,169
<i>and blow ourselves up in a determined way</i>

965
01:24:34,259 --> 01:24:36,389
is the most honorable death for us!

966
01:24:36,469 --> 01:24:39,049
<i>Your life depends on me, your leader.</i>

967
01:24:40,139 --> 01:24:41,139
Don't forget that.

968
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:44,479
<i>Let's just go in and eliminate them all!</i>

969
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:46,229
What if all the hostages are killed?

970
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:49,479
I'll deal with the communist jerks,
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

971
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:51,819
<i>If you feel bad for me just a little bit,</i>

972
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:53,819
<i>let them go. Please.</i>

973
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:56,069
Let them go.

974
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:59,199
<i>And I'm planning to release you.</i>

975
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:02,579
<i>This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?</i>

976
01:25:02,659 --> 01:25:04,159
She can't die and I can?

977
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:05,869
Stop!

978
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:06,999
<i>You leave.</i>

979
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:09,289
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

980
01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:18,259
