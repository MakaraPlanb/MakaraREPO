01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:09.859 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:32.716 line:85.83%,end
Where's the detonator?

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:35.301 line:85.83%,end
Where is it?

01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:47.731 line:85.83%,end
Guys, let's clear the way.

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:49.232 line:85.83%,end
Take it.

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:56.990 line:85.83%,end
Wait!

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:03.997 line:85.83%,end
Everyone.

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.333 line:85.83%,end
The square thing attached to the door.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.335 line:85.83%,end
It's connected to a thread.

01:24:10.086 --> 01:24:11.046 line:85.83%,end
That's a bomb.

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:13.089 line:85.83%,end
-Oh, my God!
-Don't move!

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.592 line:85.83%,end
Be careful!

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:19.304 line:85.83%,end
Come on!

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:21.723 line:85.83%,end
Do something about it!

01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:23.183 line:85.83%,end
-Come on!
-Hurry!

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.602 line:85.83%,end
-Come on!
-Do something!

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.562 line:85.83%,end
Is that really a bomb?

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:30.273 line:85.83%,end
-You're a cadet. Do something!
-I don't know how.

01:24:30.356 --> 01:24:32.233 line:85.83%,end
-Come on! Hurry!
-But I…

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.652 line:85.83%,end
-Please. Do something!
-How can I…

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:37.197 line:85.83%,end
-Do something!
-There's a bomb!

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.323 line:85.83%,end
Cadet!

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:40.033 line:85.83%,end
-Cadet!
-Yes?

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:43.244 line:85.83%,end
What do we do?

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.662 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:57.342 line:85.83%,end
Come down here!

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.357 line:85.83%,end
Don't move.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:17.570 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:24.577 line:85.83%,end
Don't move.

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:29.624 line:85.83%,end
I'll shoot you.

01:25:29.707 --> 01:25:30.917 line:85.83%,end
I'll really shoot you.

01:25:35.588 --> 01:25:36.673 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up.

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:41.094 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry up. Please.
-Hey.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:43.596 line:85.83%,end
Don't move.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.855 line:85.83%,end
-It's open!
-Sir!

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:52.772 line:85.83%,end
-Sir.
-Yes?

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.440 line:85.83%,end
Lead the students and go out first.

01:25:54.524 --> 01:25:55.692 line:85.83%,end
Hurry!

01:25:55.775 --> 01:25:57.777 line:85.83%,end
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.706 line:85.83%,end
Hurry! Go!

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:12.333 line:85.83%,end
Everyone stop!

01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:23.678 line:85.83%,end
Everyone stop.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.347 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:35.607 line:85.83%,end
Don't move.

01:26:37.108 --> 01:26:38.902 line:85.83%,end
If anyone moves…

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:47.952 line:85.83%,end
What is this?

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.581 line:85.83%,end
You want us all to die together?

01:26:57.587 --> 01:26:59.172 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

01:26:59.255 --> 01:27:00.215 line:85.83%,end
What the hell.

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.351 line:85.83%,end
What if the hostages all died?

01:27:11.434 --> 01:27:13.978 line:85.83%,end
Bombs exploded. I don't think

01:27:14.145 --> 01:27:16.481 line:85.83%,end
only 13 people died.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.483 line:85.83%,end
Only 13 must die.

01:27:18.983 --> 01:27:20.109 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 13.

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:21.861 line:85.83%,end
<i>We hear more and more heartbreaking news</i>

01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:25.031 line:85.83%,end
<i>about those who still don't know
if their children are alive.</i>

01:27:25.114 --> 01:27:26.574 line:85.83%,end
You lunatic!

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:29.202 line:85.83%,end
<i>You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?</i>

01:27:29.285 --> 01:27:31.996 line:14.17%,start
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.539 line:14.17%,start
<i>Since when did we</i>

01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:36.417 line:14.17%,start
<i>only do as agreed with the South?</i>

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:39.087 line:14.17%,start
Besides, the South's goal is

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:40.588 line:14.17%,start
to win the election,

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:42.924 line:14.17%,start
not to save the hostages' lives.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.802 line:14.17%,start
There's no way my father would…

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:50.765 line:14.17%,start
<i>Dead or alive…</i>

01:27:52.892 --> 01:27:54.477 line:14.17%,start
<i>We're in the same boat now.</i>

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:05.238 line:85.83%,end
BONUS
