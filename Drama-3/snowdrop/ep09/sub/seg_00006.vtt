00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:35.375 line:85.83%,end
Stop.

00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:37.293 line:85.83%,end
I yield!

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:40.129 line:85.83%,end
Don't kill me. Please. I'm sorry.

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.090 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:56.437 line:85.83%,end
I'll get back after washing up a little.

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:24.382 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.932 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.367 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP agent, who went in with the food

00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:54.370 line:85.83%,end
-and medical supplies… is coming out!
-She's out!

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:55.747 line:85.83%,end
-There she is!
-She's coming out!

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.789 line:85.83%,end
The students are coming!

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:00.043 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:02.045 line:85.83%,end
Move faster!

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.339 line:85.83%,end
<i>Unlike the ANSP's predictions,</i>

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:07.300 line:85.83%,end
The Northern spies are
releasing some hostages…

00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:09.093 line:85.83%,end
Those damn communists!

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:11.471 line:85.83%,end
What do we do, sir? What if they say

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:13.514 line:85.83%,end
there are only three spies in the dorm?

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:14.974 line:85.83%,end
What do you think?

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:16.851 line:85.83%,end
Take them to our interrogation room!

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:19.354 line:85.83%,end
Stop the reporters
and get them into the car!

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.648 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:24.108 line:85.83%,end
-You take care of the reporters.
-Don't worry, sir.

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.361 line:85.83%,end
-Let's go, Seung-jun.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:36.579 --> 00:32:38.414 line:85.83%,end
-Get them in the car!
-Yes, sir!

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:47.757 line:85.83%,end
Hurry!

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:19.706 line:85.83%,end
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:24.293 line:85.83%,end
Without giving in
to these evil communists,

00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.754 line:85.83%,end
we sent in a negotiation expert

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.090 line:85.83%,end
and tenaciously convinced them.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.383 line:85.83%,end
As a result,

00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:33.761 line:85.83%,end
we accomplished
the release of tens of hostages today.

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:35.805 line:85.83%,end
As we speak,

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:40.351 line:85.83%,end
the released students are being taken
to the nearby hospital for check-ups.

00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:44.605 line:85.83%,end
We'll do our best
for them to go back to their families.

00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:46.649 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.652 line:85.83%,end
-Thanks.
-Thanks to you, I got a scoop.

00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:53.740 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:33:54.782 --> 00:33:55.825 line:85.83%,end
What's that?

00:33:57.994 --> 00:34:00.121 line:85.83%,end
What… What's going on?

00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:03.750 line:85.83%,end
-Hey, just a while.
-What?

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:06.544 line:85.83%,end
-I'm borrowing this for just a while.
-No, you can't!

00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:09.172 line:85.83%,end
I'll pay you double later!

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:12.133 line:85.83%,end
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, sir!

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:13.676 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.094 line:85.83%,end
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:17.597 line:85.83%,end
Didn't I make myself clear?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.931 line:85.83%,end
I told you not to do anything!

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:21.809 line:85.83%,end
Didn't I tell you
not to do anything stupid?

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.772 line:85.83%,end
All I did was go in and come out quietly.

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:32.320 line:85.83%,end
But you came out with the hostages!
Not just one but a lot of them!

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:36.240 line:85.83%,end
They told me to do it.
What, should I have said no?

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.117 line:85.83%,end
Wait a minute.

00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:41.496 line:85.83%,end
As many as 30 hostages have been released.

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.165 line:85.83%,end
Aren't you happy?

00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:48.836 line:85.83%,end
Of course I am!

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.046 line:85.83%,end
I'm happy!

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:52.215 line:85.83%,end
I am! That's why I'm like this! Damn it.

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:54.759 line:85.83%,end
What are you looking at? Work!

00:34:56.302 --> 00:34:58.513 line:85.83%,end
Get back to work, you idiots!

00:35:01.057 --> 00:35:02.809 line:85.83%,end
You get out! Now!

00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:05.353 line:85.83%,end
I don't want to see you.
Get out of my sight.

00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:08.481 line:85.83%,end
Just go. Don't even say bye.
Just leave. Go!

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:11.776 line:85.83%,end
<i>I, An Gyeong-hui, and the ANSP</i>

00:35:12.568 --> 00:35:14.320 line:85.83%,end
<i>will do our best.</i>

00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:17.615 line:85.83%,end
<i>I solemnly swear it to the citizens.</i>

00:35:17.698 --> 00:35:19.909 line:85.83%,end
When I was in elementary school, I drew

00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:22.120 line:85.83%,end
a devil-looking Northern spy
and won an award.

00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:26.332 line:85.83%,end
But I guess they're human after all,
seeing how they released 30 hostages.
