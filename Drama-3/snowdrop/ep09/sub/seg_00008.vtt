there's something you need to know.

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:44.275 line:85.83%,end
I know it's hard to believe,

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.778 line:85.83%,end
but the doctor is also a Northern spy.

00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:51.615 line:85.83%,end
The doctor?

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:55.369 line:85.83%,end
-Dr. Kang is?
-Doctor.

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.872 line:85.83%,end
-She's in pain.
-Let me see.

00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.375 line:85.83%,end
Where does it hurt?

00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:30.779 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir. It's me.

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:34.408 line:85.83%,end
I hope you and I will watch

00:41:34.783 --> 00:41:39.872 line:85.83%,end
the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games
next year side by side.

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:44.877 line:85.83%,end
Why were the hostages already released?

00:41:45.544 --> 00:41:46.545 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:41:46.629 --> 00:41:50.341 line:85.83%,end
I swear those 30 hostages
were released under my orders.

00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:52.760 line:85.83%,end
I'm keeping them under control.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.261 line:85.83%,end
So don't worry, sir.

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.389 line:85.83%,end
I swear on my life I will get my job done
so that I'll be able

00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:00.267 line:85.83%,end
to watch the opening ceremony
with you next year, sir.

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:35.427 line:85.83%,end
<i>You bastard!
I told you not to release the hostages!</i>

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:36.929 line:85.83%,end
<i>And you released 30 of them?</i>

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.390 line:85.83%,end
I never said I'd follow your orders.

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.811 line:85.83%,end
You ignorant, fearless fool.

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:45.771 line:85.83%,end
Do you know who I am?

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.233 line:85.83%,end
I don't care, but what's your plan?

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:53.070 line:85.83%,end
You guaranteed
our safe return to the North.

00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:57.074 line:85.83%,end
Tell me how you will do that in detail.

00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.368 line:85.83%,end
When I, Nam Tae-il, say

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.538 line:85.83%,end
I'll send you back,
I'll make it happen no matter what!

00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:04.290 line:85.83%,end
I don't believe you

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.585 line:85.83%,end
and what you said
about sending us back to the North.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.921 line:85.83%,end
Look. The day before the election,

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:12.881 line:85.83%,end
after we rescue all the hostages,

00:43:12.965 --> 00:43:16.468 line:85.83%,end
we'll announce that we've killed
all of you. That's the plan!

00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:17.636 line:85.83%,end
Kill all of us?

00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:20.055 line:85.83%,end
You're going to kill us?

00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:23.434 line:85.83%,end
No, we'll fake it.

00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:24.935 line:85.83%,end
<i>You agreed to it.</i>

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:26.937 line:85.83%,end
We're just three,

00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:29.440 line:85.83%,end
but you'll announce you killed seven?

00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:30.983 line:85.83%,end
We'll bring some bodies,

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:33.402 line:85.83%,end
display them with your clothes,

00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:36.739 line:85.83%,end
<i>and hide you guys away. No one will know.</i>

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.117 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you want to go back alive,</i>

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.660 line:85.83%,end
just do as I say.

00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:44.747 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.</i>

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:50.210 line:85.83%,end
We have an astronomical amount
of money in our hands.

00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:55.424 line:85.83%,end
<i>So much money that the North won't
complain even if we end up killing you!</i>

00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:23.369 line:85.83%,end
Your lives are nothing
in front of that money.

00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:25.079 line:85.83%,end
Maybe I'll just go in and kill you.

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.623 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun. Why are you backâ€¦

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.459 line:85.83%,end
Did you have them shoot at Gang-mu?

00:44:31.377 --> 00:44:34.171 line:85.83%,end
How will you explain
once the situation is over?

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.926 line:85.83%,end
Explain?

00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:41.470 line:85.83%,end
Do I have to?

00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:45.766 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know what he's like?

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.685 line:85.83%,end
You know he won't just let it go.

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:49.603 line:85.83%,end
His colleagues shot at him, so I'm sure

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.814 line:85.83%,end
he found out it's a scheme
for the election.

00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:54.775 line:85.83%,end
You think he'll sit back
and do nothing in there?

00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:57.444 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun's right. He will never let it go.

00:44:58.404 --> 00:45:00.239 line:85.83%,end
We'll make him do nothing.

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.743 line:85.83%,end
We can just make him stay there forever.

00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:07.246 line:85.83%,end
Stay there forever?

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.833 line:85.83%,end
Are you saying you'll kill him?

00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:14.336 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:18.173 line:85.83%,end
He's a troublemaker.
We'll be better off with him dead.

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.591 line:85.83%,end
<i>If we say he died</i>

00:45:19.675 --> 00:45:20.968 line:85.83%,end
trying to save the students,

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.053 line:85.83%,end
it'll improve our agency's image too.

00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:24.221 line:85.83%,end
What the hell?

00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:25.681 line:85.83%,end
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.267 line:85.83%,end
Are you willing to kill the students too?

00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:33.939 line:85.83%,end
We need to make our boss
win the election for him to attend

00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:37.359 line:85.83%,end
the opening ceremony
of the Olympic Games as he wishes.

00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:39.194 line:85.83%,end
We're at such a crucial crossroads.
