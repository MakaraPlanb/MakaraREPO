01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.440 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.694 line:85.83%,end
For them to keep fit,

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.904 line:85.83%,end
they should do this at least.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.572 line:85.83%,end
Everyone sit.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.241 line:85.83%,end
We're not livestock!

01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.743 line:85.83%,end
You keep us here
without letting us wash up.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.286 line:85.83%,end
This is a human rights abuse!

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:41.414 line:85.83%,end
For days,

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.666 line:85.83%,end
we haven't even brushed our teeth.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.128 line:85.83%,end
It's hard to sleep here,

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.963 line:85.83%,end
but what's worse is the smell.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:50.965 line:85.83%,end
Can we wash up?

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:54.510 line:85.83%,end
I've never spent four days
without brushing my teeth.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.971 line:85.83%,end
-Please.
-Seriously.

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:58.931 line:85.83%,end
-Just this once.
-Please.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.267 line:85.83%,end
-I feel so itchy.
-I can't take it anymore.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.269 line:85.83%,end
-Please.
-I'll be obedient.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.604 line:85.83%,end
-Please.
-Let us wash up.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.648 line:85.83%,end
-I feel so itchy.
-Please.

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.317 line:85.83%,end
We'll feel better
if you let us wash our faces.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.404 line:85.83%,end
You can let us do that much, right?

01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:15.156 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind, you brats?

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:22.955 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.458 line:85.83%,end
Ten people at a time.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.419 line:85.83%,end
Do anything funny,
and the rest will get hurt.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.755 line:85.83%,end
Our basins are in our rooms.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.757 line:85.83%,end
Can we stop by our rooms?

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.009 line:85.83%,end
But don't go above the second floor.

01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:37.636 line:85.83%,end
First group of ten.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.138 line:85.83%,end
-Me!
-Me!

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.723 line:85.83%,end
-Me first!
-Me first!

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:42.183 line:85.83%,end
-Me first!
-Me first!

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:44.310 line:85.83%,end
-Me!
-Me!

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.520 line:85.83%,end
-Me first!
-Me first!

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:47.855 line:85.83%,end
Stand in a line in front of me.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:51.734 line:85.83%,end
-Move.
-Number!

01:07:52.985 --> 01:07:54.487 line:85.83%,end
Call out numbers!

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.030 line:85.83%,end
One.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:58.074 line:85.83%,end
-Two.
-Three.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.909 line:85.83%,end
-Four.
-Five.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:07.583 line:85.83%,end
-Why are we running?
-Ko Hye-ryeong!

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.212 line:85.83%,end
-Let's go to our room on the 3rd floor.
-What? Butâ€¦

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:12.963 line:85.83%,end
I forgot where I put my toothbrush.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:16.258 line:85.83%,end
It's okay. I have a new one,
so don't worry. Let's go.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.107 line:85.83%,end
Well,

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:35.820 line:85.83%,end
my room's next to the washing room.
Can I stop by for a second?

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:38.864 line:85.83%,end
You must stay on the second floor.

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.246 line:85.83%,end
I'm not a student here,

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.290 line:85.83%,end
so I have no one to borrow anything from.

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:54.964 line:85.83%,end
Where's your room?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.175 line:85.83%,end
On basement one.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:01.554 line:85.83%,end
Just kill me.

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:03.305 line:85.83%,end
I won't get out.

01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.266 line:85.83%,end
I didn't know my bed felt this nice.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.520 line:85.83%,end
Should we tell them
to let us sleep in our rooms from now on?

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.856 line:85.83%,end
That's just what you would say.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.274 line:85.83%,end
You think we're camping?

01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:14.775 line:85.83%,end
I was just joking, you wench.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.986 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, are you looking for something?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.905 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui, have you seen my electric watch?

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:21.699 line:85.83%,end
Your watch?

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:23.409 line:85.83%,end
Right! The bag.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.202 line:85.83%,end
It must be in the red bag.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.785 line:85.83%,end
Don't run!

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.995 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.830 line:85.83%,end
You can't stop me!

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:14.668 line:85.83%,end
Thankâ€¦

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.547 line:85.83%,end
Thank you for last time.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:28.057 line:85.83%,end
No one's ever taken my side before.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.311 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.855 line:85.83%,end
I mean it.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.281 line:85.83%,end
My room is over there.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:48.327 line:85.83%,end
Go.
