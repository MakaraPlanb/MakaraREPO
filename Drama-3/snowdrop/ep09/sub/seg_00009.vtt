00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:41.113 line:85.83%,end
The girls' lives are not important.

00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:44.074 line:85.83%,end
If there comes a situation
where we have to kill them,

00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:45.868 line:85.83%,end
we'll just rescue your daughter--

00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:50.080 line:85.83%,end
Rescuing only my daughter
while all of the press is here?

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.417 line:85.83%,end
Letting all the people watch it?

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:55.586 line:85.83%,end
Did you forget about the agreement?

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:00.090 line:85.83%,end
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.885 line:85.83%,end
and saving the hostages. Right?

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.220 line:85.83%,end
What I'm saying is,
depending on the situation--

00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.972 line:85.83%,end
Even still!

00:46:07.055 --> 00:46:10.559 line:85.83%,end
We must save all of the students.

00:46:11.477 --> 00:46:13.145 line:85.83%,end
Including my daughter.

00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:23.697 line:85.83%,end
Take care, sir.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.703 line:85.83%,end
That hypocritical bastard.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.413 line:85.83%,end
Isn't he?

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:34.082 line:85.83%,end
He even sent his son to the front lines

00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:36.752 line:85.83%,end
to remain in his position as director.

00:46:37.002 --> 00:46:40.631 line:85.83%,end
If you think about it,
it's his fault his son died!

00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:42.174 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:45.010 line:85.83%,end
If the election goes wrong,

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:48.388 line:85.83%,end
he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!

00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:51.975 line:85.83%,end
Then,

00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:53.769 line:85.83%,end
depending on the situation,

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.897 line:85.83%,end
might we end up killing the students?

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.820 line:85.83%,end
You are right, sir.

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.324 line:85.83%,end
"You are right, sir"?

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.869 line:85.83%,end
These goddamn bastards.

00:47:27.761 --> 00:47:29.012 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.357 line:85.83%,end
Hey, take them inside.

00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:43.235 line:85.83%,end
Keep in line.

00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:45.279 line:85.83%,end
<i>Just like those released earlier,</i>

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.614 line:85.83%,end
have all of them sign the NDA
saying they'll stay quiet.

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:51.159 line:85.83%,end
Scare them a little bit

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.911 line:85.83%,end
and send them to our hospital.

00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:57.374 line:85.83%,end
And make sure
no reporters are on your tail.

00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:02.296 line:85.83%,end
They arrived with no problem.

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.714 line:85.83%,end
So don't worry, sir.

00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:06.091 line:85.83%,end
-A cigarette.
-Pardon?

00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:07.175 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:12.306 line:85.83%,end
Why are you carrying a bug detector?

00:48:12.806 --> 00:48:14.683 line:85.83%,end
What? What's going on?

00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:28.196 line:85.83%,end
Me?

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:36.955 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam. A bug!

00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.460 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell planted this?

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:47.007 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:48.717 line:85.83%,end
The delivery guy.

00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:51.887 line:85.83%,end
Why can't we go in there?

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.847 line:85.83%,end
-We can't!
-My kid's in there!

00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:56.642 line:85.83%,end
-We need to go in!
-What's going on?

00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:58.393 line:85.83%,end
-What's this?
-What's going on?

00:48:58.477 --> 00:48:59.937 line:85.83%,end
-What's this?
-Coming through.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.772 line:85.83%,end
Make way, please.

00:49:01.855 --> 00:49:03.732 line:85.83%,end
What? What's going on?

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:06.234 line:85.83%,end
I came to pick up the bowls.

00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:08.612 line:85.83%,end
-Let him pass.
-Let him pass!

00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:11.156 line:85.83%,end
<i>What, are you going to kill him?</i>

00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:13.325 line:85.83%,end
<i>Of course.</i>

00:49:13.408 --> 00:49:15.410 line:85.83%,end
<i>Are you willing to kill the students too?</i>

00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:16.995 line:85.83%,end
<i>The girls' lives are not important.</i>

00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:19.748 line:85.83%,end
<i>If the election goes wrong,</i>

00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:22.918 line:85.83%,end
<i>he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!</i>

00:49:24.002 --> 00:49:25.963 line:85.83%,end
We need to send this into the dorm.

00:49:26.546 --> 00:49:27.714 line:85.83%,end
And if it's revealed--

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:30.425 line:85.83%,end
Wait. You'll give it to the spies?

00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.272 line:85.83%,end
What's the emergency frequency
you and your fiancÃ©e use?

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.152 line:85.83%,end
What's the rush?
You gave her until tomorrow morning.

00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:31.445 line:85.83%,end
We're running out of time.

00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:35.115 line:85.83%,end
I need to see
if it's possible to get the proof.

00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:37.826 line:85.83%,end
What's the frequency?
