Comrade Joo. It's time to patrol.

<i>It was "Bimok,"
so beautiful that it makes you sad.</i>

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:20.259 line:85.83%,end
<i>On a sunny and weedy corner
of a mountain foot,</i>

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:23.805 line:85.83%,end
<i>there was a wooden cross
on a nameless soldier's grave.</i>

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.765 line:85.83%,end
<i>And the song was inspired--</i>

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:32.855 line:85.83%,end
Polka Dot.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.571 line:85.83%,end
You're quite a good singer. Sing it again.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:43.157 line:85.83%,end
Look.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.827 line:85.83%,end
My name is Ko Hye-ryeong, not Polka Dot.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.205 line:85.83%,end
Besides, I don't sing
without any accompaniment.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.916 line:85.83%,end
-I'm Hosu's Maria Callas.
-Maria Callas!

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.460 line:85.83%,end
Is anyone willing

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.587 line:85.83%,end
to play piano for Hye-ryeong?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.716 line:85.83%,end
You're good at it.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.176 line:85.83%,end
I'll play it for you.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.856 line:85.83%,end
<i>The cannon and gun smoke
swept the deep vale</i>

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:18.109 line:85.83%,end
<i>At the sunny placeâ€¦</i>

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.069 line:85.83%,end
I don't think it'll work.

01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:24.323 line:85.83%,end
But that's the safest place to hide.

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:28.286 line:85.83%,end
I doubt Yeong-ro will tell them easily.

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:31.247 line:85.83%,end
She's even hiding that
she's the ANSP director's daughter.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.126 line:85.83%,end
This is a scheme for the election!

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.129 line:85.83%,end
How long will you dance
to the ANSP's tune?

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:46.846 line:85.83%,end
How on earth will you lose Kang Cheong-ya?

01:02:53.394 --> 01:02:55.772 line:85.83%,end
<i>-There has been
-There has been</i>

<i>-Moss at every joint and frown
-Moss at every joint and frown</i>

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.240 line:85.83%,end
Quiet!

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.501 line:85.83%,end
Well, what about the second verse?

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.780 line:14.17%,start
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.412 line:85.83%,end
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:55.373 line:85.83%,end
but can I go to the restroom?

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.041 line:85.83%,end
I can't hold it.

01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:58.459 line:85.83%,end
Lie down.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.641 line:85.83%,end
I need to go to the restroom.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:23.734 line:85.83%,end
Those who need to go, come all at once.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.528 line:85.83%,end
This is the last time.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.403 line:85.83%,end
Hey, cadet.

01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:12.909 line:85.83%,end
We'll escape tomorrow.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.119 line:85.83%,end
The hall director knows it.

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:18.706 line:85.83%,end
Joo, the one who took them
to the restroom. You take care of him.

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:20.666 line:85.83%,end
Us?

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.626 line:85.83%,end
Got it?

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:24.253 line:85.83%,end
Go.
