ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:07.901 line:14.17%,start
EPISODE 9

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.366 line:14.17%,start
How did the ANSP team leader
escape through the prayer room?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.328 line:14.17%,start
There was a secret passage
to the exit on basement two.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.498 line:14.17%,start
A secret passage?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.249 line:14.17%,start
No wonder

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.503 line:14.17%,start
the old man and hall director
exchanged looks suspiciously.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.755 line:14.17%,start
We should go.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.215 line:14.17%,start
Follow me.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.009 line:85.83%,end
If this button is pushed,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.513 line:85.83%,end
the dorm will explode.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:20.890 line:85.83%,end
Right?

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.814 line:85.83%,end
You say you don't

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.235 line:85.83%,end
want to hurt anyone when you have this?

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.532 line:85.83%,end
I understand why you don't trust me.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.912 line:85.83%,end
But that's for defending ourselves,
not for killing you.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:46.291 line:85.83%,end
Hundreds of soldiers are
surrounding this place.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.461 line:85.83%,end
I needed to do something to protect
my team members as their leader.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.801 line:85.83%,end
Stay away!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.514 line:85.83%,end
-No!
-What if the soldiers break in?

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.145 line:85.83%,end
Will you still not use it then
since it's not for killing?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.813 line:85.83%,end
I told you.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.108 line:85.83%,end
I don't want to hurt anyone in this dorm.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.735 line:85.83%,end
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.655 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.534 line:85.83%,end
After the cruel things I did to you,

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.413 line:85.83%,end
why would I lie to you
about getting out in nine days?

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.500 line:85.83%,end
Everything I've done to you,
that's already too hard for me to bear.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.589 line:85.83%,end
We're really going
to get out of here in nine days.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.425 line:85.83%,end
So please

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.595 line:85.83%,end
-give that back to me.
-Don't come near.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.305 line:85.83%,end
Stay away.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.228 line:85.83%,end
Why? Why in nine days?

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.773 line:85.83%,end
Why not get out right now?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.025 line:85.83%,end
Why wait until nine days later?

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.827 line:85.83%,end
You're lying again, aren't you?

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.248 line:85.83%,end
You're lying again.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:13.127 line:85.83%,end
Everything you've told me was a lie.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.467 line:85.83%,end
That's not true.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.220 line:85.83%,end
Give that to me. It's dangerous.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.485 line:85.83%,end
Don't--

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.790 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.334 line:85.83%,end
Please believe me.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.588 line:85.83%,end
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.
