00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:34.574 line:85.83%,end
it's 57, right?

00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.787 line:85.83%,end
But they say the hostages are
unlikely to be released,

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.581 line:85.83%,end
so don't worry about it, ma'am.

00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:43.208 line:85.83%,end
Really?

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.253 line:85.83%,end
The hostages won't be released?

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.714 line:85.83%,end
But still,

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.299 line:85.83%,end
you shouldn't be clapping.

00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:57.180 line:85.83%,end
From now on,
30 of you who are to be released

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:59.808 line:85.83%,end
will get out of the dorm
with the ANSP agent.

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:05.730 line:85.83%,end
Go out one by one in order.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.114 line:85.83%,end
Follow me in order. Be careful.

00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:29.629 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down.

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:50.775 line:85.83%,end
I need to go to the restroom!

00:27:48.249 --> 00:27:49.793 line:85.83%,end
You have it easy, you bastard.

00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:53.546 line:85.83%,end
Cleaned up with new clothes.

00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:56.091 line:85.83%,end
Hey, you wear this.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:57.884 line:85.83%,end
-No, give that to me.
-No.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.844 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:20.782 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:24.911 line:85.83%,end
They say they'll leave here in nine days.

00:28:26.162 --> 00:28:28.456 line:85.83%,end
Is that true?

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:31.042 line:85.83%,end
Soo-ho said that?

00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:34.963 line:85.83%,end
Did he tell you that?

00:28:36.297 --> 00:28:37.298 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.552 line:85.83%,end
He said they'll leave quietly.

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.638 line:85.83%,end
But why nine days later?

00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:50.895 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell anyone

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:53.857 line:85.83%,end
what I'm about to tell you.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.192 line:85.83%,end
I told you!

00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.030 line:85.83%,end
Where's the money bag?

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:03.116 line:85.83%,end
You think I'm crazy? Why would I tell you?

00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:06.161 line:85.83%,end
I'll take that money with me
no matter what

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.956 line:85.83%,end
and give you your share. Just count on me.

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.960 line:85.83%,end
Don't touch me.

00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.378 line:85.83%,end
What's your problem?

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.548 line:85.83%,end
We both were born to wrong parents.

00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:20.508 line:85.83%,end
We should help each other!

00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:23.553 line:85.83%,end
Stop!

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.473 line:85.83%,end
Damn it!

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.986 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I'm uneducated and poor.

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:42.238 line:85.83%,end
I received nothing from my parents,

00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:44.616 line:85.83%,end
except this body!

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.410 line:85.83%,end
But do you know how hard

00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:49.704 line:85.83%,end
I'm trying to save my ill father?

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.292 line:85.83%,end
You think I'm like you,
a leech living off his old father?

00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:57.712 line:85.83%,end
You b****.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.048 line:85.83%,end
What do you know about me?

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:03.843 line:85.83%,end
Who are you to judge me?

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:08.306 line:85.83%,end
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Kim Man-dong is?

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:19.359 line:85.83%,end
You communist bastard!

00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.449 line:85.83%,end
You're dead meat.
