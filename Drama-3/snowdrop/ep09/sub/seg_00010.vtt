00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.043 line:85.83%,end
It's 44.

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.182 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:02.184 line:85.83%,end
<i>Han-na, do you hear me?</i>

00:51:05.353 --> 00:51:07.397 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee? What's going on?

00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:08.940 line:85.83%,end
Did you get the proof?

00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:10.776 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I got it.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.114 line:85.83%,end
We found the delivery bike.

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.576 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:26.374 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.425 line:85.83%,end
I filmed Tae-il
and the released hostages being taken.

00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:38.053 line:85.83%,end
-Give me a gun.
-Here, sir.

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:53.985 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****.

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.656 line:85.83%,end
<i>I went easy on you for old times' sake,</i>

00:51:57.864 --> 00:51:59.449 line:85.83%,end
and you betrayed me?

00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:04.996 line:85.83%,end
Come on. What's wrong, sir?

00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:06.581 line:85.83%,end
What's this about?

00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:08.583 line:85.83%,end
Why are you with this bastard?

00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:10.335 line:85.83%,end
<i>Are you working with him?</i>

00:52:10.418 --> 00:52:12.546 line:85.83%,end
<i>-What are you talking about?
-Hey!</i>

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.841 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Take her too.
-Yes, sir.</i>

00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:18.635 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? Let go of me!

00:52:18.718 --> 00:52:21.012 line:85.83%,end
We found a bug in the camp.

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:24.015 line:85.83%,end
-Let go!
-What are you waiting for? Get out.

00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:25.183 line:85.83%,end
Stay still.

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:27.686 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Get out!
-If you take me,</i>

00:52:27.769 --> 00:52:32.190 line:85.83%,end
<i>my company won't just sit still.
This is suppressing free speech!</i>

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.027 line:85.83%,end
Han-na must've been caught.

00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:39.739 line:85.83%,end
She's in danger because of you!

00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.701 line:85.83%,end
Sit.

00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:45.912 line:85.83%,end
Proof? What's the use of goddamn proof?

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:49.082 line:85.83%,end
You know that they'll kill us all
nine days later.

00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.500 line:85.83%,end
You know they will.

00:52:55.088 --> 00:52:56.214 line:85.83%,end
Shut up.

00:52:56.298 --> 00:52:59.718 line:85.83%,end
The party guaranteed the safe return
to the North of all three of us.

00:53:02.053 --> 00:53:03.555 line:85.83%,end
Do you still not get it?

00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:06.141 line:85.83%,end
Are you that stupid?

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.978 line:85.83%,end
Right. I heard
you told Yeong-ro you'll leave

00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:11.605 line:85.83%,end
nine days later.

00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.566 line:85.83%,end
She asked why nine days later,

00:53:15.066 --> 00:53:17.694 line:85.83%,end
so I told her all this is
a scheme for the election.

00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:21.198 line:85.83%,end
That her dad might kill all the hostages.

00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:23.491 line:85.83%,end
-You told her?
-What?

00:53:24.075 --> 00:53:25.327 line:85.83%,end
You feel bad for her?

00:53:25.744 --> 00:53:27.454 line:85.83%,end
On top of her brother's death,

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:31.875 line:85.83%,end
she found out that her dad might kill
all her friends. She must be going crazy.

00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:35.420 line:85.83%,end
She was already blaming herself for this.

00:53:36.087 --> 00:53:37.672 line:85.83%,end
She must just want to die.

00:53:38.798 --> 00:53:39.966 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:46.973 line:85.83%,end
It's hard, isn't it?

00:53:48.642 --> 00:53:50.143 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure it's hard for you too.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.647 line:85.83%,end
Because you love Yeong-ro.

00:53:59.819 --> 00:54:00.946 line:85.83%,end
Shut up.

00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.697 line:85.83%,end
You think I'm a turncoat?

00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:04.658 line:85.83%,end
Does loving the girl who saved you
make you a turncoat?

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:09.454 line:85.83%,end
Your party traded
their loyal agents for money.

00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:12.791 line:85.83%,end
What about them?

00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:35.605 line:85.83%,end
You're the ANSP team leader.

00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:45.282 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP frames and kills those who
fight against the tyranny of the regime.

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:50.954 line:85.83%,end
You're the regime's hounds

00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:54.499 line:85.83%,end
that trample on innocent people's lives
to make the security state.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.044 line:85.83%,end
That's what the ANSP is.

00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:02.132 line:85.83%,end
And you're their agent.
You have no right to blame me.

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.975 line:85.83%,end
In the end, they're all the same.

00:55:12.767 --> 00:55:14.477 line:85.83%,end
On the pretext of repatriation,

00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:17.063 line:85.83%,end
the North deceived
countless Korean-Japanese

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.316 line:85.83%,end
and trampled on their lives.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:23.653 line:85.83%,end
The South made the security state.

00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:37.751 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho.

00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:44.007 line:85.83%,end
You must wake up now.
