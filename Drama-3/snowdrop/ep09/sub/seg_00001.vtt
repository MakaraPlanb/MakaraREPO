00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:20.069 line:85.83%,end
There's nothing
I can do for you but watch.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.991 line:85.83%,end
And that's driving me crazy.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:25.968 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang Cheong-ya.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.430 line:85.83%,end
It's this way.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.062 line:85.83%,end
Hey, student.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.610 line:85.83%,end
Tell the hall director

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:44.612 line:85.83%,end
to bring me some water.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:46.656 line:85.83%,end
Tell her.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.533 line:85.83%,end
Now.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:51.494 line:85.83%,end
Gosh.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.038 line:85.83%,end
I'm parched.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.498 line:85.83%,end
Give me some water.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.668 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.254 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:03.047 line:85.83%,end
Shut your trap, will you?

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.340 line:85.83%,end
I'm thirsty.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.883 line:85.83%,end
I'm so thirsty.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:06.801 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.887 line:85.83%,end
I'm so thirsty. Come on.

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:11.431 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.225 line:85.83%,end
Give me some water.

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:15.601 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.271 line:85.83%,end
Just a cup of water.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.398 line:85.83%,end
But you had some not long ago!

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.941 line:85.83%,end
I didn't get any.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.235 line:85.83%,end
And I'm all tied up.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.362 line:85.83%,end
I feel so stifled.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.781 line:85.83%,end
Come on. Just give me some water.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.200 line:85.83%,end
Anyone wants to bring him water?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.757 line:85.83%,end
What did you want to tell me?

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:50.052 line:85.83%,end
We have no time,
so I'll ask you straightforward.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.681 line:85.83%,end
Did you really not know
Lim Soo-ho was hiding in the dorm?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:55.850 line:85.83%,end
When you even bugged the dorm?

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.520 line:85.83%,end
Did you help him hide

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.939 line:85.83%,end
since you're on the same side?

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.114 line:85.83%,end
On the same side?

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.160 line:85.83%,end
Shut it before I rip you to shreds.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.828 line:85.83%,end
I'm sick and tired

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.414 line:85.83%,end
of you people.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.036 line:85.83%,end
I warned you not to do anything stupid

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.206 line:85.83%,end
and that I'd not let it slide again.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.624 line:85.83%,end
What did I do?

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.462 line:85.83%,end
How else did Eun Yeong-ro
find out about the detonator I had?

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:12.009 line:85.83%,end
I just tried to stop her
from trying to escape.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:19.475 line:85.83%,end
I told her about the detonator in your
pocket to stop her from acting rashly!

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.646 line:85.83%,end
Shouldn't you ask me why
before hitting me?

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:31.988 line:85.83%,end
Sit.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:10.026 line:85.83%,end
You say they'll kill everyone here
including you and me in nine days?

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.740 line:85.83%,end
If you're trying to make me surrender,
you should stop here.

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:16.657 line:85.83%,end
Surrender?
