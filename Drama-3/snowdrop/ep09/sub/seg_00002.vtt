00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.203 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll accept your surrender?

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:26.250 line:85.83%,end
They even play with the citizens' lives
to maintain their power.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:30.379 line:85.83%,end
I can't let those bastards have their way.
Is that so hard to understand?

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.722 line:85.83%,end
The party considers the people
as its children.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:42.224 line:85.83%,end
They'd never abandon you?
You really think so?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.936 line:85.83%,end
A huge sum of money
must be at stake in this joint scheme.

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:50.608 line:85.83%,end
You think your party will give up
the money to save three spies?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.526 line:85.83%,end
You really believe that?

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.746 line:85.83%,end
You think you're safe since you have…

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.666 line:85.83%,end
the ANSP director's daughter?

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.250 line:85.83%,end
Wake up.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:11.921 line:85.83%,end
I bet they'll try everything they can to
get her out of here before the election.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.101 line:85.83%,end
Bring me proof that what you say is true.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.395 line:85.83%,end
Proof?

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:29.689 line:85.83%,end
Tied up like this?

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.108 line:85.83%,end
Your subordinate will come back in later.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.736 line:85.83%,end
Tell her to bring me proof
that I can trust.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.659 line:85.83%,end
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.747 line:85.83%,end
But if she brings it,

00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.791 line:85.83%,end
will you destroy that detonator

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:51.544 line:85.83%,end
and work with me?

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:57.258 line:85.83%,end
Are you willing to work with us
to get out of here alive?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:06.600 line:85.83%,end
How could you be so stupid
to hide a gun in Dr. Kang's bag?

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:10.521 line:85.83%,end
They say those bastards won't
release her because of you!

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:11.897 line:85.83%,end
Apologize. Now.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:15.401 line:85.83%,end
Don't do anything stupid again.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.779 line:85.83%,end
And just come out
as soon as you deliver the supplies. Okay?

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.365 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.659 line:85.83%,end
By the way, sir,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.245 line:85.83%,end
seeing how he specifically asked for her,

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:29.498 line:85.83%,end
he must like her very much.

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.751 line:85.83%,end
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.420 line:85.83%,end
Are you serious right now?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.632 line:85.83%,end
I stabbed them in the back
to let the SWAT team break in

00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.801 line:85.83%,end
without knowing it was a lie.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.846 line:85.83%,end
He might be asking for me
in order to get back at me.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:44.764 line:85.83%,end
Hey, look.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.016 line:85.83%,end
You make it sound like we fooled you.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.059 line:85.83%,end
They're threatening to blow up the dorm!

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.145 line:85.83%,end
How can we send the SWAT team in?

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.230 line:85.83%,end
We must save the students!

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.447 line:85.83%,end
Go

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.576 line:85.83%,end
tell Dr. Kang
that we'll save her at all costs

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.330 line:85.83%,end
and to have faith in me and hang in there.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.249 line:85.83%,end
Only Dr. Kang?

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:18.380 line:85.83%,end
-God damn it. Seriously…
-You understood, Jang, right?

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.965 line:85.83%,end
Get out. You don't have much time.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.593 line:85.83%,end
-Now.
-You get out too.

00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:23.636 line:85.83%,end
Wait for me.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.348 line:85.83%,end
God, my blood pressure again.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.521 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP has gotten
the food and medical supplies

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:36.982 line:85.83%,end
the spies demanded
ready in front of their camp.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.484 line:85.83%,end
The supplies include

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.736 line:85.83%,end
ten boxes of cup noodles,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.281 line:85.83%,end
drugs for diabetes and blood pressure,
and some men's clothes.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.199 line:85.83%,end
He's coming out!

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.451 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:48.661 line:85.83%,end
Gyeong-hui!

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.873 line:85.83%,end
Can't you do your job right?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.584 line:85.83%,end
How could you let
a stray dog waltz in here?

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:56.502 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.295 line:85.83%,end
Are you mad at me?

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:00.923 line:85.83%,end
Because a stray dog like me is so polite?

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.300 line:85.83%,end
Come on, Gyeong-hui. Be understanding.

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.386 line:85.83%,end
For old times' sake!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.221 line:85.83%,end
She's going in!

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.649 line:85.83%,end
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.442 line:85.83%,end
Who's in there other than the students?

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:25.197 line:85.83%,end
In return for providing the food
and medical supplies the spies demanded,

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.366 line:85.83%,end
we, the ANSP,

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.661 line:85.83%,end
strongly urged them
to release the hostages safely.

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:33.289 line:85.83%,end
Do you have any contingency plans?

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.333 line:85.83%,end
<i>If the spies don't release
the hostages this time,</i>

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.462 line:85.83%,end
<i>unfortunately, it might prolong
the hostage situation.</i>

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.549 line:85.83%,end
<i>That's how we're looking at it. However--</i>

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.844 line:85.83%,end
It might prolong it?

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.556 line:85.83%,end
They've already started putting on an act.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.532 line:85.83%,end
You're watching the news, right?
Listen carefully.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.118 line:85.83%,end
In the people's eyes,

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.996 line:85.83%,end
<i>it must look like
you're making this drag on</i>

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.791 line:85.83%,end
<i>and we're trying to break in
to take you down at any chance we get.</i>

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.461 line:85.83%,end
And it must look like we're not able to
