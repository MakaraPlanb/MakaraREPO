00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:22.880 line:85.83%,end
because you might blow yourselves up!

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:24.340 line:85.83%,end
Killing all the hostages!

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.301 line:85.83%,end
<i>So,</i>

00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:30.429 line:85.83%,end
you can't release any of your hostages.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.264 line:85.83%,end
Okay?

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.350 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.435 line:85.83%,end
And don't touch Dr. Kang.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.522 line:85.83%,end
<i>Don't even step on her shadow. Okay?</i>

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:47.571 line:85.83%,end
I should get back down.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.074 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.791 line:85.83%,end
Hand the detonator over to me.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:06.048 line:85.83%,end
-Pardon?
-You let a girl take it away from you.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.759 line:85.83%,end
How can I trust you with it?

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.433 line:85.83%,end
If you don't bring back
your revolutionary spirit now,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.561 line:85.83%,end
I will kill you myself.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.376 line:85.83%,end
Release the hostages.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:47.798 line:85.83%,end
He thinks our revolutionary warriors are
his minions. We should teach him a lesson.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.800 line:85.83%,end
Don't you agree?

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.986 line:85.83%,end
You bestowed men's clothes on us.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.529 line:85.83%,end
I'm forever grateful.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.032 line:85.83%,end
I'm so excited.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.618 line:85.83%,end
Could I get changed right away?

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.497 line:85.83%,end
I told you to check for explosives first.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:23.584 line:85.83%,end
I will, sir.

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.883 line:85.83%,end
Gosh, it's heavy.

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.137 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.514 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in! Now!

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.767 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in!

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:51.737 line:85.83%,end
Didn't I tell you it's most important

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.114 line:85.83%,end
to maintain mutual trust?

00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:59.119 line:85.83%,end
I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.288 line:85.83%,end
I had no other choice.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.376 line:85.83%,end
But the SWAT team
didn't break in after all, did they?

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.213 line:85.83%,end
Leave this woman to me.

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:11.924 line:85.83%,end
Go upstairs with the supplies.

00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:14.009 line:85.83%,end
Follow me with them.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.177 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:17.513 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:19.556 line:85.83%,end
Here we go.

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:23.268 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.397 line:85.83%,end
You should tell me
before you make a deal with them.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.733 line:85.83%,end
You're releasing 30 hostages, and what?

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.819 line:85.83%,end
Just ten boxes of cup noodles?

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:34.404 line:85.83%,end
-You're on the losing end.
-Gwang-tae.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.617 line:85.83%,end
Just lie low.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.169 line:85.83%,end
Follow me.

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:01.890 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:04.685 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.812 line:85.83%,end
Are you all right?

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.314 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no. What happened to your face?

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:12.776 line:85.83%,end
We don't have much time.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.570 line:85.83%,end
I'm fine.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.239 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry, and just sit.

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:20.200 line:85.83%,end
Now.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.343 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.930 line:85.83%,end
Sir, It's a scoop.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.308 line:85.83%,end
I smell something fishy.

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:46.810 line:85.83%,end
That's not what I mean.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:50.147 line:85.83%,end
Something doesn't feel right here. Yes!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.443 line:85.83%,end
I got to go! I'll call you later!

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.861 line:85.83%,end
PAY PHONE

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.030 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness!

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:02.451 line:85.83%,end
Food delivery!

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.454 line:85.83%,end
-Here!
-What took you so long?

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.497 line:85.83%,end
-What's with you?
-I'm sorry.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.374 line:85.83%,end
Here's the <i>jjamppong.</i>

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.919 line:85.83%,end
-Here are the <i>tangsuyuk</i> and <i>dumplings.</i>
-All right.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.129 line:85.83%,end
Don't be late next time!

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.174 line:85.83%,end
-Where should I put them?
-There.

00:20:17.257 --> 00:20:18.842 line:85.83%,end
-Here.
-Thank you.
