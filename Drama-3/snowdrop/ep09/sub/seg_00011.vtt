00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.469 line:85.83%,end
Lives of mere pawns like us…

00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.220 line:85.83%,end
-We must--
-No.

00:55:51.639 --> 00:55:52.682 line:85.83%,end
"We"?

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.354 line:85.83%,end
You and I are enemies.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.751 line:85.83%,end
Would you like some?

00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:21.836 line:85.83%,end
I'm not hungry.

00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:26.174 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you say you'll rip me to shreds?

00:56:29.969 --> 00:56:33.306 line:85.83%,end
I said some harsh words… I admit it.

00:56:36.601 --> 00:56:37.811 line:85.83%,end
How did you find out?

00:56:38.853 --> 00:56:40.438 line:85.83%,end
The room inside your office.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:45.568 line:85.83%,end
It's quite impressive.

00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:52.325 line:85.83%,end
Please keep it

00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:54.536 line:85.83%,end
from the students.

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.121 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:59.541 line:85.83%,end
You work for my agency after all.

00:57:01.292 --> 00:57:03.628 line:85.83%,end
How could a mere agent like me

00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:05.588 line:85.83%,end
blow your cover?

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.675 line:85.83%,end
We're on the same side.

00:57:11.177 --> 00:57:12.345 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:15.140 line:85.83%,end
Since both of our lives
are in their hands,

00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:16.724 line:85.83%,end
let me tell you something.

00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:20.603 line:85.83%,end
Though I yielded to their power
since I'm weak,

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:24.983 line:85.83%,end
I still think they're evil people who
frame the innocent to climb the ladder.

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:26.693 line:85.83%,end
I've never…

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.363 line:85.83%,end
sold my students out to them.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.661 line:85.83%,end
Then,

00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:39.789 line:85.83%,end
Let's save the students…

00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:42.834 line:85.83%,end
together.

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.343 line:85.83%,end
Save?

00:57:58.516 --> 00:57:59.350 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:01.352 line:85.83%,end
Go back to where you were.

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.453 line:85.83%,end
<i>I didn't plant the bug!</i>

00:58:19.037 --> 00:58:21.706 line:85.83%,end
So how can I have any tape to give you?

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.000 line:85.83%,end
When you

00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.211 line:85.83%,end
disguised yourself as a delivery guy

00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:30.423 line:85.83%,end
and came in to film Mr. Nam with this,

00:58:31.216 --> 00:58:33.426 line:85.83%,end
you planted the bug, you bastard!

00:58:36.095 --> 00:58:38.056 line:85.83%,end
Damn.

00:58:39.474 --> 00:58:43.520 line:85.83%,end
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've just planted my bug.

00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.480 line:85.83%,end
COSMOS TOYS

00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:47.440 line:85.83%,end
Let's get to work.

00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:54.155 line:85.83%,end
Dong-jae. Oh Dong-jae!

00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:56.699 line:85.83%,end
Open this! Come on!

00:58:56.783 --> 00:58:58.493 line:85.83%,end
Open up!

00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:01.704 line:85.83%,end
Open it!
