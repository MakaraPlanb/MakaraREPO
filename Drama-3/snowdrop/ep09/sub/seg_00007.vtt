00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.845 line:85.83%,end
What? The release of the hostages
was unlikely?

00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:42.807 line:85.83%,end
So how many are left?

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.017 line:85.83%,end
How many? Tell me!

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:48.104 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, you can't sit down.

00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:50.314 line:85.83%,end
The pins will hurt you.

00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:55.862 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:57.989 line:85.83%,end
How can I not worry right now?

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.740 line:85.83%,end
What if

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.368 line:85.83%,end
exactly 13 students are left?

00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:03.452 line:85.83%,end
Then what?

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.165 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am.

00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:13.421 line:85.83%,end
This is really

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.632 line:85.83%,end
confidential information.

00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:24.015 line:85.83%,end
According to my husband,
this hostage situation is

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.187 line:85.83%,end
a scheme that the North and South
planned together.

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.064 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:36:34.483 --> 00:36:35.318 line:85.83%,end
The North and South?

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:38.404 line:85.83%,end
For the election?

00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:40.114 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:44.452 line:85.83%,end
So I doubt they're really going

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:47.455 line:85.83%,end
to kill those college girls. Right?

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:49.999 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.127 line:85.83%,end
-They won't, right?
-No.

00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.051 line:85.83%,end
What about our Yeong-ro?

00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:01.802 line:85.83%,end
Was she released too?

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.513 line:85.83%,end
Was Yeong-ro released too?

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.099 line:85.83%,end
Well, I guess so.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.518 line:85.83%,end
Anything else that's unusual?

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.981 line:85.83%,end
What? They shot at Gang-mu
to make him go back in?

00:37:14.607 --> 00:37:15.608 line:85.83%,end
When?

00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.943 line:85.83%,end
Okay, I'll be there.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.278 line:85.83%,end
I should go to the scene.

00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:21.489 line:85.83%,end
Why? What's going on?

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:32.708 line:85.83%,end
Now that 30 of them have been released,

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:37.463 line:85.83%,end
27 are left in there.

00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:42.718 line:85.83%,end
This is amazing.

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:45.721 line:85.83%,end
It's getting closer to 13.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:55.314 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho is… How should I put it?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.444 line:85.83%,end
I know this since I used to live with him.

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:03.948 line:85.83%,end
I didn't get any killer or spy vibes
from him at all.

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:07.660 line:85.83%,end
-Rather, he was quite sweet.
-Oh, God.

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:10.371 line:85.83%,end
And he was quite thoughtful.

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.707 line:85.83%,end
He released 30, and you're his fan now?

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.583 line:85.83%,end
It's all your fault, Gwang-tae.

00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:16.043 line:85.83%,end
You suggested the blind date.

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.462 line:85.83%,end
Come on, you can't blame him for that.

00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:21.590 line:85.83%,end
I mean, he didn't know Soo-ho was
a spy when he was setting us

00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:23.801 line:85.83%,end
-up on the blind date.
-Jeez.

00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:26.387 line:85.83%,end
Why are you taking his side?
Do you like him?

00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:30.766 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:38.441 line:85.83%,end
Well, I… It's not that.

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:41.694 line:85.83%,end
-I just…
-Hey. Yoon Seol-hui.

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:43.863 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me…

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:46.115 line:85.83%,end
Yes, you're right, Hye-ryeong.

00:38:47.533 --> 00:38:50.077 line:85.83%,end
When I saw Seol-hui at the Open House,

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.413 line:85.83%,end
she struck my heart

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:55.124 line:85.83%,end
like it was destiny.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.544 line:85.83%,end
Struck your heart?
What is she, Cupid's Arrow?

00:38:58.627 --> 00:39:01.589 line:85.83%,end
What a sly bastard. That's not love.
You're just after her money.

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.799 line:85.83%,end
How could you say that?

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:07.720 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui is my muse and sun.
You know nothing.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:10.931 line:85.83%,end
Seol-hui.

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.101 line:85.83%,end
Will you marry me?

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:17.188 line:85.83%,end
I'll protect you

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.940 line:85.83%,end
for the rest of my life.

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:22.651 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:25.571 line:85.83%,end
Having fun?

00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:34.205 line:85.83%,end
Look at her. She's actually happy.

00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:36.540 line:85.83%,end
So why did you two-time him

00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:38.667 line:85.83%,end
when you weren't even interested in him?

00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:43.464 line:85.83%,end
What's a proposal without a ring?

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.633 line:85.83%,end
You're right. What a shame.

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:47.551 line:85.83%,end
It happens only once in your life!

00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.804 line:85.83%,end
By the way, have you even kissed?

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.180 line:85.83%,end
-Stop that!
-Keep it down.

00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:56.394 line:85.83%,end
<i>Are you saying</i>

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.771 line:85.83%,end
the presidential election is in nine days,

00:39:58.854 --> 00:40:00.940 line:85.83%,end
and for my dad to win the election,

00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:04.151 line:85.83%,end
we might all be killed?

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.240 line:85.83%,end
I can't say for sure,
but we can't rule out that possibility.

00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:23.254 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:26.590 line:85.83%,end
How about you use me?

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:29.343 line:85.83%,end
Use you?

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.101 line:85.83%,end
Then before that,
