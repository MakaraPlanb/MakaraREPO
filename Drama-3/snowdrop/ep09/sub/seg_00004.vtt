00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.608 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam. The food is here.

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.651 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.528 line:85.83%,end
<i>The doctor is being held at the moment…</i>

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.364 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.991 line:85.83%,end
It's like I'm locked up in prison.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.576 line:85.83%,end
Hang in there, sir.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.955 line:85.83%,end
If the reporters see you,
they'll make a fuss about it.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.415 line:85.83%,end
"The administration's number two guy
is at the scene.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.376 line:85.83%,end
it must be some political scheme."

00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:53.835 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:55.879 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:00.550 line:85.83%,end
Hey, wait!

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:03.095 line:85.83%,end
<i>…and in this crisis,
the ANSP's wise judgment</i>

00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:06.682 line:85.83%,end
<i>and action is needed
more than ever at the scene.</i>

00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:11.436 line:85.83%,end
Hey, where's the pickled radish?

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.314 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:17.484 line:85.83%,end
Look at this guy. Where's your head at?

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:19.987 line:85.83%,end
Enjoy!

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.824 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is a scheme.</i>

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.493 line:85.83%,end
A joint scheme
for the presidential election.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.996 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:31.540 line:85.83%,end
But still, how could they shoot at you?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.834 line:85.83%,end
Professor Han's case was also part of it.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:36.336 line:85.83%,end
That's why they got us away from him.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.338 line:85.83%,end
But he was killed,

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.341 line:85.83%,end
so this hostage situation
became their plan B.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.885 line:85.83%,end
They're using this…

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.931 line:85.83%,end
for the election?

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:50.809 line:85.83%,end
No way.

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:56.273 line:85.83%,end
They're not planning
to kill the students, are they?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.860 line:85.83%,end
Will you just pray they won't?

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.660 line:85.83%,end
What do I have to do then? Just tell me.

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.704 line:85.83%,end
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:13.206 line:85.83%,end
they'll try to kill everyone
including the hostages.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.500 line:85.83%,end
We need proof
that they're planning to do it.

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:19.338 line:85.83%,end
As a matter of fact,
Gal and I agreed to dig into it together.

00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:21.089 line:85.83%,end
As soon as we get it, I'll have Gal--

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:22.466 line:85.83%,end
If you act rashly,

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:26.303 line:85.83%,end
both you and Gal will be killed.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:28.889 line:85.83%,end
Bring it to me once you get it.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.393 line:85.83%,end
What are you going to do in here?

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:46.156 line:85.83%,end
I'll demand more supplies tomorrow.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.533 line:85.83%,end
I'll ask them to send you in again,

00:22:49.117 --> 00:22:51.078 line:85.83%,end
so find it by tomorrow morning.

00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:53.038 line:85.83%,end
But how can I…

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:06.968 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:09.554 line:85.83%,end
Are you two…

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:13.141 line:85.83%,end
We're both rats in a trap.
If we fight each other, we'll all die.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:15.602 line:85.83%,end
We must get out alive.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:19.398 line:85.83%,end
Just a minute.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.359 line:85.83%,end
Give us privacy just for a minute.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.612 line:85.83%,end
If you're done talking, come out.
Both of you.

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:28.156 line:85.83%,end
Comrade.

00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:33.745 line:85.83%,end
She's my fiancée.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.873 line:85.83%,end
Is a minute too much to ask?

00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:46.216 line:85.83%,end
Come out.

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:01.773 line:85.83%,end
So tell me.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:07.237 line:85.83%,end
Exactly how many single women
are in the dorm at the moment?

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.991 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 56 single women.

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:14.911 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang's in there too, right?

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:17.831 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right. Dr. Kang is

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:19.458 line:85.83%,end
also

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:21.501 line:85.83%,end
single.

00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:23.170 line:85.83%,end
Is it possible

00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:26.923 line:85.83%,end
that she's been married
and didn't tell us?

00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:31.178 line:85.83%,end
Come on. No way.

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:35.390 line:85.83%,end
I once asked her why she was still single.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:36.433 line:85.83%,end
And?

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:44.107 line:85.83%,end
One day in winter, while she was hiking
in some snowy mountains,

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.735 line:85.83%,end
she slipped and hung
on the edge of a cliff.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:50.071 line:85.83%,end
<i>Just when she thought
she was going to die,</i>

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.908 line:85.83%,end
<i>some guy saved her.</i>

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.785 line:85.83%,end
<i>Without knowing his name or age,</i>

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:59.998 line:85.83%,end
she spent the night with him
in some cave and parted ways.

00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:03.001 line:85.83%,end
Since then,
she's never been able to get over him.

00:25:04.794 --> 00:25:06.213 line:85.83%,end
She said she was

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.091 line:85.83%,end
waiting to meet him like some destiny.

00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:12.594 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness.

00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:16.890 line:85.83%,end
It sounds like something
from a romance novel.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.644 line:85.83%,end
Did anything happen in that cave?

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.270 line:85.83%,end
Stop it.

00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:26.233 line:85.83%,end
I didn't peg her as naive.

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:28.777 line:85.83%,end
That's what I thought too.

00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:32.781 line:85.83%,end
So if we include Dr. Kang,
