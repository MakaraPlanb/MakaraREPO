00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,564
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:18,901
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:26,366
How did the ANSP team leader
escape through the prayer room?

4
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,328
There was a secret passage
to the exit on basement two.

5
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:32,498
A secret passage?

6
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:34,249
No wonder

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,503
the old man and hall director
exchanged looks suspiciously.

8
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:39,755
We should go.

9
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,215
Follow me.

10
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,009
If this button is pushed,

11
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,513
the dorm will explode.

12
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:31,890
Right?

13
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:38,814
You say you don't

14
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,235
want to hurt anyone when you have this?

15
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,532
I understand why you don't trust me.

16
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:53,912
But that's for defending ourselves,
not for killing you.

17
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:57,291
Hundreds of soldiers are
surrounding this place.

18
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,461
I needed to do something to protect
my team members as their leader.

19
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,801
Stay away!

20
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:12,514
-No!
-What if the soldiers break in?

21
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,145
Will you still not use it then
since it's not for killing?

22
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,813
I told you.

23
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,108
I don't want to hurt anyone in this dorm.

24
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,735
Do you expect me to believe that?

25
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,655
Yes.

26
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,534
After the cruel things I did to you,

27
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:36,413
why would I lie to you
about getting out in nine days?

28
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:40,500
Everything I've done to you,
that's already too hard for me to bear.

29
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,589
We're really going
to get out of here in nine days.

30
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,425
So please

31
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,595
-give that back to me.
-Don't come near.

32
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,305
Stay away.

33
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:59,228
Why? Why in nine days?

34
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,773
Why not get out right now?

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,025
Why wait until nine days later?

36
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,827
You're lying again, aren't you?

37
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,248
You're lying again.

38
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,127
Everything you've told me was a lie.

39
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,467
That's not true.

40
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,220
Give that to me. It's dangerous.

41
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,485
Don't--

42
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,790
Please.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,334
Please believe me.

44
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,588
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

45
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:31,069
There's nothing
I can do for you but watch.

46
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,991
And that's driving me crazy.

47
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:36,968
Comrade Kang Cheong-ya.

48
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,430
It's this way.

49
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,062
Hey, student.

50
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,610
Tell the hall director

51
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,612
to bring me some water.

52
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,656
Tell her.

53
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,533
Now.

54
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,494
Gosh.

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,038
I'm parched.

56
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,498
Give me some water.

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,668
Hey!

58
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:12,254
Hey.

59
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,047
Shut your trap, will you?

60
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm thirsty.

61
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:16,883
I'm so thirsty.

62
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:17,801
Please.

63
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:20,887
I'm so thirsty. Come on.

64
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,431
Please.

65
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,225
Give me some water.

66
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:26,601
Hey.

67
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:29,271
Just a cup of water.

68
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,398
But you had some not long ago!

69
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:32,941
I didn't get any.

70
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:35,235
And I'm all tied up.

71
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,362
I feel so stifled.

72
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,781
Come on. Just give me some water.

73
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,200
Anyone wants to bring him water?

74
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,757
What did you want to tell me?

75
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:01,052
We have no time,
so I'll ask you straightforward.

76
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,681
Did you really not know
Lim Soo-ho was hiding in the dorm?

77
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,850
When you even bugged the dorm?

78
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,520
Did you help him hide

79
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:12,939
since you're on the same side?

80
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,114
On the same side?

81
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,160
Shut it before I rip you to shreds.

82
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,828
I'm sick and tired

83
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,414
of you people.

84
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,036
I warned you not to do anything stupid

85
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,206
and that I'd not let it slide again.

86
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,624
What did I do?

87
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:17,462
How else did Eun Yeong-ro
find out about the detonator I had?

88
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,009
I just tried to stop her
from trying to escape.

89
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:30,475
I told her about the detonator in your
pocket to stop her from acting rashly!

90
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,646
Shouldn't you ask me why
before hitting me?

91
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:42,988
Sit.

92
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:21,026
You say they'll kill everyone here
including you and me in nine days?

93
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,740
If you're trying to make me surrender,
you should stop here.

94
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:27,657
Surrender?

95
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,203
You think they'll accept your surrender?

96
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:37,250
They even play with the citizens' lives
to maintain their power.

97
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:41,379
I can't let those bastards have their way.
Is that so hard to understand?

98
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,722
The party considers the people
as its children.

99
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,224
They'd never abandon you?
You really think so?

100
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,936
A huge sum of money
must be at stake in this joint scheme.

101
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:01,608
You think your party will give up
the money to save three spies?

102
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,526
You really believe that?

103
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,746
You think you're safe since you have…

104
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,666
the ANSP director's daughter?

105
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,250
Wake up.

106
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:22,921
I bet they'll try everything they can to
get her out of here before the election.

107
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,101
Bring me proof that what you say is true.

108
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,395
Proof?

109
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:40,689
Tied up like this?

110
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,108
Your subordinate will come back in later.

111
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:46,736
Tell her to bring me proof
that I can trust.

112
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,659
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

113
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,747
But if she brings it,

114
00:10:58,331 --> 00:10:59,791
will you destroy that detonator

115
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,544
and work with me?

116
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,258
Are you willing to work with us
to get out of here alive?

117
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:17,600
How could you be so stupid
to hide a gun in Dr. Kang's bag?

118
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:21,521
They say those bastards won't
release her because of you!

119
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:22,897
Apologize. Now.

120
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,401
Don't do anything stupid again.

121
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,779
And just come out
as soon as you deliver the supplies. Okay?

122
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,365
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,659
By the way, sir,

124
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:37,245
seeing how he specifically asked for her,

125
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,498
he must like her very much.

126
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,751
-Is that so?
-Yes.

127
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,420
Are you serious right now?

128
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,632
I stabbed them in the back
to let the SWAT team break in

129
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:51,801
without knowing it was a lie.

130
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,846
He might be asking for me
in order to get back at me.

131
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:55,764
Hey, look.

132
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,016
You make it sound like we fooled you.

133
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,059
They're threatening to blow up the dorm!

134
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,145
How can we send the SWAT team in?

135
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,230
We must save the students!

136
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,447
Go

137
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:16,576
tell Dr. Kang
that we'll save her at all costs

138
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,330
and to have faith in me and hang in there.

139
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,249
Only Dr. Kang?

140
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:29,380
-God damn it. Seriously…
-You understood, Jang, right?

141
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:30,965
Get out. You don't have much time.

142
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,593
-Now.
-You get out too.

143
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:34,636
Wait for me.

144
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,348
God, my blood pressure again.

145
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:44,521
The ANSP has gotten
the food and medical supplies

146
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,982
the spies demanded
ready in front of their camp.

147
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,484
The supplies include

148
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,736
ten boxes of cup noodles,

149
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,281
drugs for diabetes and blood pressure,
and some men's clothes.

150
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,199
He's coming out!

151
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:58,451
Hey!

152
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,661
Gyeong-hui!

153
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,873
Can't you do your job right?

154
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,584
How could you let
a stray dog waltz in here?

155
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:07,502
I'm sorry, sir.

156
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:09,295
Are you mad at me?

157
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,923
Because a stray dog like me is so polite?

158
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,300
Come on, Gyeong-hui. Be understanding.

159
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:16,386
For old times' sake!

160
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,221
She's going in!

161
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:29,649
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

162
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,442
Who's in there other than the students?

163
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:36,197
In return for providing the food
and medical supplies the spies demanded,

164
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,366
we, the ANSP,

165
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,661
strongly urged them
to release the hostages safely.

166
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,289
Do you have any contingency plans?

167
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:47,333
<i>If the spies don't release
the hostages this time,</i>

168
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:51,462
<i>unfortunately, it might prolong
the hostage situation.</i>

169
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,549
<i>That's how we're looking at it. However--</i>

170
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:57,844
It might prolong it?

171
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,556
They've already started putting on an act.

172
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,532
You're watching the news, right?
Listen carefully.

173
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,118
In the people's eyes,

174
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,996
<i>it must look like
you're making this drag on</i>

175
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,791
<i>and we're trying to break in
to take you down at any chance we get.</i>

176
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,461
And it must look like we're not able to

177
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:33,880
because you might blow yourselves up!

178
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,340
Killing all the hostages!

179
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,301
<i>So,</i>

180
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:41,429
you can't release any of your hostages.

181
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,264
Okay?

182
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,350
Wait.

183
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,435
And don't touch Dr. Kang.

184
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,522
<i>Don't even step on her shadow. Okay?</i>

185
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,571
I should get back down.

186
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,074
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,791
Hand the detonator over to me.

188
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:17,048
-Pardon?
-You let a girl take it away from you.

189
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,759
How can I trust you with it?

190
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:27,433
If you don't bring back
your revolutionary spirit now,

191
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,561
I will kill you myself.

192
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,376
Release the hostages.

193
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:58,798
He thinks our revolutionary warriors are
his minions. We should teach him a lesson.

194
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,800
Don't you agree?

195
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,986
You bestowed men's clothes on us.

196
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:21,529
I'm forever grateful.

197
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,032
I'm so excited.

198
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,618
Could I get changed right away?

199
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:31,497
I told you to check for explosives first.

200
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,584
I will, sir.

201
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:41,883
Gosh, it's heavy.

202
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,137
Damn it.

203
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,514
SWAT team, go in! Now!

204
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,767
SWAT team, go in!

205
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,737
Didn't I tell you it's most important

206
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,114
to maintain mutual trust?

207
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:10,119
I'm… I'm sorry.

208
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,288
I had no other choice.

209
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,376
But the SWAT team
didn't break in after all, did they?

210
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,213
Leave this woman to me.

211
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:22,924
Go upstairs with the supplies.

212
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,009
Follow me with them.

213
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,177
Yes, sir.

214
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:28,513
All right.

215
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,556
Here we go.

216
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,268
Sir.

217
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:38,397
You should tell me
before you make a deal with them.

218
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:40,733
You're releasing 30 hostages, and what?

219
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,819
Just ten boxes of cup noodles?

220
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:45,404
-You're on the losing end.
-Gwang-tae.

221
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,617
Just lie low.

222
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,169
Follow me.

223
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:12,890
Mr. Lee.

224
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,685
Mr. Lee.

225
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,812
Are you all right?

226
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,314
Oh, no. What happened to your face?

227
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,776
We don't have much time.

228
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,570
I'm fine.

229
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,239
Don't worry, and just sit.

230
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,200
Now.

231
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,343
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

232
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:52,930
Sir, It's a scoop.

233
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:55,308
I smell something fishy.

234
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:57,810
That's not what I mean.

235
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:01,147
Something doesn't feel right here. Yes!

236
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,443
I got to go! I'll call you later!

237
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:06,861
PAY PHONE

238
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,030
Oh, my goodness!

239
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:13,451
Food delivery!

240
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,454
-Here!
-What took you so long?

241
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:18,497
-What's with you?
-I'm sorry.

242
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:20,374
Here's the <i>jjamppong.</i>

243
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,919
-Here are the <i>tangsuyuk</i> and <i>dumplings.</i>
-All right.

244
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:25,129
Don't be late next time!

245
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:28,174
-Where should I put them?
-There.

246
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,842
-Here.
-Thank you.

247
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:45,608
Mr. Nam. The food is here.

248
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:46,651
Okay.

249
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:49,528
<i>The doctor is being held at the moment…</i>

250
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,364
Damn it.

251
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:53,991
It's like I'm locked up in prison.

252
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,576
Hang in there, sir.

253
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,955
If the reporters see you,
they'll make a fuss about it.

254
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,415
"The administration's number two guy
is at the scene.

255
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,376
it must be some political scheme."

256
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,835
What?

257
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,879
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,550
Hey, wait!

259
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,095
<i>…and in this crisis,
the ANSP's wise judgment</i>

260
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:17,682
<i>and action is needed
more than ever at the scene.</i>

261
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:22,436
Hey, where's the pickled radish?

262
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,314
I'm sorry, sir.

263
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,484
Look at this guy. Where's your head at?

264
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:30,987
Enjoy!

265
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:34,824
<i>This is a scheme.</i>

266
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,493
A joint scheme
for the presidential election.

267
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,996
What?

268
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,540
But still, how could they shoot at you?

269
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,834
Professor Han's case was also part of it.

270
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,336
That's why they got us away from him.

271
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:49,338
But he was killed,

272
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,341
so this hostage situation
became their plan B.

273
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,885
They're using this…

274
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,931
for the election?

275
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:01,809
No way.

276
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:07,273
They're not planning
to kill the students, are they?

277
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,860
Will you just pray they won't?

278
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:19,660
What do I have to do then? Just tell me.

279
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,704
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

280
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,206
they'll try to kill everyone
including the hostages.

281
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,500
We need proof
that they're planning to do it.

282
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:30,338
As a matter of fact,
Gal and I agreed to dig into it together.

283
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,089
As soon as we get it, I'll have Gal--

284
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,466
If you act rashly,

285
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,303
both you and Gal will be killed.

286
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:39,889
Bring it to me once you get it.

287
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,393
What are you going to do in here?

288
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:57,156
I'll demand more supplies tomorrow.

289
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,533
I'll ask them to send you in again,

290
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,078
so find it by tomorrow morning.

291
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,038
But how can I…

292
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:17,968
Wait.

293
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:20,554
Are you two…

294
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:24,141
We're both rats in a trap.
If we fight each other, we'll all die.

295
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:26,602
We must get out alive.

296
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:30,398
Just a minute.

297
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,359
Give us privacy just for a minute.

298
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,612
If you're done talking, come out.
Both of you.

299
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:39,156
Comrade.

300
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,745
She's my fiancée.

301
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,873
Is a minute too much to ask?

302
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,216
Come out.

303
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:12,773
So tell me.

304
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:18,237
Exactly how many single women
are in the dorm at the moment?

305
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,991
Exactly 56 single women.

306
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,911
Dr. Kang's in there too, right?

307
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,831
Oh, right. Dr. Kang is

308
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:30,458
also

309
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,501
single.

310
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,170
Is it possible

311
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:37,923
that she's been married
and didn't tell us?

312
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,178
Come on. No way.

313
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,390
I once asked her why she was still single.

314
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:47,433
And?

315
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:55,107
One day in winter, while she was hiking
in some snowy mountains,

316
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,735
she slipped and hung
on the edge of a cliff.

317
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,071
<i>Just when she thought
she was going to die,</i>

318
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:03,908
<i>some guy saved her.</i>

319
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,785
<i>Without knowing his name or age,</i>

320
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,998
she spent the night with him
in some cave and parted ways.

321
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:14,001
Since then,
she's never been able to get over him.

322
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:17,213
She said she was

323
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,091
waiting to meet him like some destiny.

324
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,594
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,890
It sounds like something
from a romance novel.

326
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,644
Did anything happen in that cave?

327
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:33,270
Stop it.

328
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:37,233
I didn't peg her as naive.

329
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:39,777
That's what I thought too.

330
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:43,781
So if we include Dr. Kang,

331
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:45,574
it's 57, right?

332
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:49,787
But they say the hostages are
unlikely to be released,

333
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,581
so don't worry about it, ma'am.

334
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,208
Really?

335
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,253
The hostages won't be released?

336
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:00,714
But still,

337
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,299
you shouldn't be clapping.

338
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,180
From now on,
30 of you who are to be released

339
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,808
will get out of the dorm
with the ANSP agent.

340
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,730
Go out one by one in order.

341
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,114
Follow me in order. Be careful.

342
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,629
Keep your heads down.

343
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,775
I need to go to the restroom!

344
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,793
You have it easy, you bastard.

345
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,546
Cleaned up with new clothes.

346
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,091
Hey, you wear this.

347
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:08,884
-No, give that to me.
-No.

348
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,844
Hey!

349
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:31,782
Mr. Lee.

350
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:35,911
They say they'll leave here in nine days.

351
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:39,456
Is that true?

352
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:42,042
Soo-ho said that?

353
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:45,963
Did he tell you that?

354
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:48,298
Yes.

355
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,552
He said they'll leave quietly.

356
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:54,638
But why nine days later?

357
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,895
Don't tell anyone

358
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,857
what I'm about to tell you.

359
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,192
I told you!

360
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:12,030
Where's the money bag?

361
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,116
You think I'm crazy? Why would I tell you?

362
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,161
I'll take that money with me
no matter what

363
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:20,956
and give you your share. Just count on me.

364
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:24,960
Don't touch me.

365
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,378
What's your problem?

366
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,548
We both were born to wrong parents.

367
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,508
We should help each other!

368
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:34,553
Stop!

369
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:37,473
Damn it!

370
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,986
Yes, I'm uneducated and poor.

371
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,238
I received nothing from my parents,

372
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:55,616
except this body!

373
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,410
But do you know how hard

374
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,704
I'm trying to save my ill father?

375
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,292
You think I'm like you,
a leech living off his old father?

376
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,712
You b****.

377
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,048
What do you know about me?

378
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,843
Who are you to judge me?

379
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:19,306
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Kim Man-dong is?

380
00:29:28,023 --> 00:29:30,359
You communist bastard!

381
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:37,449
You're dead meat.

382
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,375
Stop.

383
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,293
I yield!

384
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:51,129
Don't kill me. Please. I'm sorry.

385
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:53,090
Please.

386
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,437
I'll get back after washing up a little.

387
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,382
What?

388
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:43,932
Darn it.

389
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:02,367
The ANSP agent, who went in with the food

390
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:05,370
-and medical supplies… is coming out!
-She's out!

391
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:06,747
-There she is!
-She's coming out!

392
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,789
The students are coming!

393
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,043
Hurry up!

394
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:13,045
Move faster!

395
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,339
<i>Unlike the ANSP's predictions,</i>

396
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:18,300
The Northern spies are
releasing some hostages…

397
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:20,093
Those damn communists!

398
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:22,471
What do we do, sir? What if they say

399
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,514
there are only three spies in the dorm?

400
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:25,974
What do you think?

401
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,851
Take them to our interrogation room!

402
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:30,354
Stop the reporters
and get them into the car!

403
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,648
Hurry up! Hurry!

404
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:35,108
-You take care of the reporters.
-Don't worry, sir.

405
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,361
-Let's go, Seung-jun.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,414
-Get them in the car!
-Yes, sir!

407
00:31:57,923 --> 00:31:58,757
Hurry!

408
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:30,706
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

409
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:35,293
Without giving in
to these evil communists,

410
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:37,754
we sent in a negotiation expert

411
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,090
and tenaciously convinced them.

412
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:41,383
As a result,

413
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:44,761
we accomplished
the release of tens of hostages today.

414
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:46,805
As we speak,

415
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:51,351
the released students are being taken
to the nearby hospital for check-ups.

416
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:55,605
We'll do our best
for them to go back to their families.

417
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:57,649
Thank you.

418
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,652
-Thanks.
-Thanks to you, I got a scoop.

419
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:04,740
What?

420
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:06,825
What's that?

421
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:11,121
What… What's going on?

422
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:14,750
-Hey, just a while.
-What?

423
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,544
-I'm borrowing this for just a while.
-No, you can't!

424
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:20,172
I'll pay you double later!

425
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:23,133
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, sir!

426
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:24,676
Hey!

427
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,094
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

428
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,597
Didn't I make myself clear?

429
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,931
I told you not to do anything!

430
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,809
Didn't I tell you
not to do anything stupid?

431
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:36,772
All I did was go in and come out quietly.

432
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:43,320
But you came out with the hostages!
Not just one but a lot of them!

433
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:47,240
They told me to do it.
What, should I have said no?

434
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,117
Wait a minute.

435
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,496
As many as 30 hostages have been released.

436
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,165
Aren't you happy?

437
00:33:58,835 --> 00:33:59,836
Of course I am!

438
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,046
I'm happy!

439
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:03,215
I am! That's why I'm like this! Damn it.

440
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:05,759
What are you looking at? Work!

441
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,513
Get back to work, you idiots!

442
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:13,809
You get out! Now!

443
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:16,353
I don't want to see you.
Get out of my sight.

444
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:19,481
Just go. Don't even say bye.
Just leave. Go!

445
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:22,776
<i>I, An Gyeong-hui, and the ANSP</i>

446
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,320
<i>will do our best.</i>

447
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:28,615
<i>I solemnly swear it to the citizens.</i>

448
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:30,909
When I was in elementary school, I drew

449
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,120
a devil-looking Northern spy
and won an award.

450
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:37,332
But I guess they're human after all,
seeing how they released 30 hostages.

451
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,845
What? The release of the hostages
was unlikely?

452
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,807
So how many are left?

453
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,017
How many? Tell me!

454
00:34:56,101 --> 00:34:59,104
Ma'am, you can't sit down.

455
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:01,314
The pins will hurt you.

456
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,862
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

457
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:08,989
How can I not worry right now?

458
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:10,740
What if

459
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,368
exactly 13 students are left?

460
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:14,452
Then what?

461
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:18,165
Ma'am.

462
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:24,421
This is really

463
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,632
confidential information.

464
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:35,015
According to my husband,
this hostage situation is

465
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,187
a scheme that the North and South
planned together.

466
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:43,064
My goodness.

467
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,318
The North and South?

468
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:49,404
For the election?

469
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:51,114
Yes.

470
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:55,452
So I doubt they're really going

471
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:58,455
to kill those college girls. Right?

472
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:00,999
You're right.

473
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,127
-They won't, right?
-No.

474
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:11,051
What about our Yeong-ro?

475
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,802
Was she released too?

476
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:15,513
Was Yeong-ro released too?

477
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,099
Well, I guess so.

478
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,518
Anything else that's unusual?

479
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:24,981
What? They shot at Gang-mu
to make him go back in?

480
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:26,608
When?

481
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:27,943
Okay, I'll be there.

482
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,278
I should go to the scene.

483
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,489
Why? What's going on?

484
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:43,708
Now that 30 of them have been released,

485
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,463
27 are left in there.

486
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:53,718
This is amazing.

487
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:56,721
It's getting closer to 13.

488
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:06,314
Lim Soo-ho is… How should I put it?

489
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,444
I know this since I used to live with him.

490
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:14,948
I didn't get any killer or spy vibes
from him at all.

491
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:18,660
-Rather, he was quite sweet.
-Oh, God.

492
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:21,371
And he was quite thoughtful.

493
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,707
He released 30, and you're his fan now?

494
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,583
It's all your fault, Gwang-tae.

495
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,043
You suggested the blind date.

496
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,462
Come on, you can't blame him for that.

497
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,590
I mean, he didn't know Soo-ho was
a spy when he was setting us

498
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,801
-up on the blind date.
-Jeez.

499
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:37,387
Why are you taking his side?
Do you like him?

500
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:41,766
What?

501
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:49,441
Well, I… It's not that.

502
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,694
-I just…
-Hey. Yoon Seol-hui.

503
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:54,863
Don't tell me…

504
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:57,115
Yes, you're right, Hye-ryeong.

505
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,077
When I saw Seol-hui at the Open House,

506
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,413
she struck my heart

507
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:06,124
like it was destiny.

508
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,544
Struck your heart?
What is she, Cupid's Arrow?

509
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,589
What a sly bastard. That's not love.
You're just after her money.

510
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,799
How could you say that?

511
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,720
Seol-hui is my muse and sun.
You know nothing.

512
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:21,931
Seol-hui.

513
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,101
Will you marry me?

514
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,188
I'll protect you

515
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:30,940
for the rest of my life.

516
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:33,651
Hey!

517
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:36,571
Having fun?

518
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,205
Look at her. She's actually happy.

519
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:47,540
So why did you two-time him

520
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:49,667
when you weren't even interested in him?

521
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:54,464
What's a proposal without a ring?

522
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:56,633
You're right. What a shame.

523
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:58,551
It happens only once in your life!

524
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:00,804
By the way, have you even kissed?

525
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,180
-Stop that!
-Keep it down.

526
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:07,394
<i>Are you saying</i>

527
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:09,771
the presidential election is in nine days,

528
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:11,940
and for my dad to win the election,

529
00:39:12,357 --> 00:39:15,151
we might all be killed?

530
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,240
I can't say for sure,
but we can't rule out that possibility.

531
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:34,254
Sir.

532
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,590
How about you use me?

533
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,343
Use you?

534
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,101
Then before that,

535
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:50,603
there's something you need to know.

536
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,275
I know it's hard to believe,

537
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,778
but the doctor is also a Northern spy.

538
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:02,615
The doctor?

539
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,369
-Dr. Kang is?
-Doctor.

540
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:08,872
-She's in pain.
-Let me see.

541
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,375
Where does it hurt?

542
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,779
Yes, sir. It's me.

543
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,408
I hope you and I will watch

544
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:50,872
the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games
next year side by side.

545
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:55,877
Why were the hostages already released?

546
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:57,545
Sir.

547
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:01,341
I swear those 30 hostages
were released under my orders.

548
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm keeping them under control.

549
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,261
So don't worry, sir.

550
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:08,389
I swear on my life I will get my job done
so that I'll be able

551
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:11,267
to watch the opening ceremony
with you next year, sir.

552
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:46,427
<i>You bastard!
I told you not to release the hostages!</i>

553
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:47,929
<i>And you released 30 of them?</i>

554
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:50,390
I never said I'd follow your orders.

555
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:54,811
You ignorant, fearless fool.

556
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:56,771
Do you know who I am?

557
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:00,233
I don't care, but what's your plan?

558
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:04,070
You guaranteed
our safe return to the North.

559
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:08,074
Tell me how you will do that in detail.

560
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:10,368
When I, Nam Tae-il, say

561
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:13,538
I'll send you back,
I'll make it happen no matter what!

562
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:15,290
I don't believe you

563
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,585
and what you said
about sending us back to the North.

564
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:21,921
Look. The day before the election,

565
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:23,881
after we rescue all the hostages,

566
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:27,468
we'll announce that we've killed
all of you. That's the plan!

567
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:28,636
Kill all of us?

568
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:31,055
You're going to kill us?

569
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:34,434
No, we'll fake it.

570
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,935
<i>You agreed to it.</i>

571
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:37,937
We're just three,

572
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,440
but you'll announce you killed seven?

573
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:41,983
We'll bring some bodies,

574
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:44,402
display them with your clothes,

575
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:47,739
<i>and hide you guys away. No one will know.</i>

576
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:51,117
<i>If you want to go back alive,</i>

577
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,660
just do as I say.

578
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:55,747
<i>If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.</i>

579
00:42:57,457 --> 00:43:01,210
We have an astronomical amount
of money in our hands.

580
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:06,424
<i>So much money that the North won't
complain even if we end up killing you!</i>

581
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:34,369
Your lives are nothing
in front of that money.

582
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:36,079
Maybe I'll just go in and kill you.

583
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:38,623
Mr. Eun. Why are you back…

584
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,459
Did you have them shoot at Gang-mu?

585
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:45,171
How will you explain
once the situation is over?

586
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:49,926
Explain?

587
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:52,470
Do I have to?

588
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:56,766
Don't you know what he's like?

589
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,685
You know he won't just let it go.

590
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,603
His colleagues shot at him, so I'm sure

591
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:02,814
he found out it's a scheme
for the election.

592
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:05,775
You think he'll sit back
and do nothing in there?

593
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:08,444
Mr. Eun's right. He will never let it go.

594
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:11,239
We'll make him do nothing.

595
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:15,743
We can just make him stay there forever.

596
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:18,246
Stay there forever?

597
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,833
Are you saying you'll kill him?

598
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:25,336
Of course.

599
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:29,173
He's a troublemaker.
We'll be better off with him dead.

600
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:30,591
<i>If we say he died</i>

601
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:31,968
trying to save the students,

602
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:34,053
it'll improve our agency's image too.

603
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:35,221
What the hell?

604
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:36,681
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

605
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,267
Are you willing to kill the students too?

606
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:44,939
We need to make our boss
win the election for him to attend

607
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:48,359
the opening ceremony
of the Olympic Games as he wishes.

608
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:50,194
We're at such a crucial crossroads.

609
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:52,113
The girls' lives are not important.

610
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:55,074
If there comes a situation
where we have to kill them,

611
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,868
we'll just rescue your daughter--

612
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:01,080
Rescuing only my daughter
while all of the press is here?

613
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:04,417
Letting all the people watch it?

614
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,586
Did you forget about the agreement?

615
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,090
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

616
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:13,885
and saving the hostages. Right?

617
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:16,220
What I'm saying is,
depending on the situation--

618
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:17,972
Even still!

619
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:21,559
We must save all of the students.

620
00:45:22,477 --> 00:45:24,145
Including my daughter.

621
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:34,697
Take care, sir.

622
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,703
That hypocritical bastard.

623
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:42,413
Isn't he?

624
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,082
He even sent his son to the front lines

625
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,752
to remain in his position as director.

626
00:45:48,002 --> 00:45:51,631
If you think about it,
it's his fault his son died!

627
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:53,174
Hey.

628
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:56,010
If the election goes wrong,

629
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:59,388
he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!

630
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:02,975
Then,

631
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,769
depending on the situation,

632
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:07,897
might we end up killing the students?

633
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,820
You are right, sir.

634
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:18,324
"You are right, sir"?

635
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:21,869
These goddamn bastards.

636
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,012
Hurry up!

637
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,357
Hey, take them inside.

638
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:54,235
Keep in line.

639
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:56,279
<i>Just like those released earlier,</i>

640
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,614
have all of them sign the NDA
saying they'll stay quiet.

641
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:02,159
Scare them a little bit

642
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,911
and send them to our hospital.

643
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:08,374
And make sure
no reporters are on your tail.

644
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:13,296
They arrived with no problem.

645
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:14,714
So don't worry, sir.

646
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:17,091
-A cigarette.
-Pardon?

647
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:18,175
Yes, sir.

648
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,306
Why are you carrying a bug detector?

649
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:25,683
What? What's going on?

650
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:39,196
Me?

651
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:47,955
Mr. Nam. A bug!

652
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,460
Who the hell planted this?

653
00:47:56,923 --> 00:47:58,007
I'm sorry.

654
00:47:58,883 --> 00:47:59,717
The delivery guy.

655
00:48:00,885 --> 00:48:02,887
Why can't we go in there?

656
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,847
-We can't!
-My kid's in there!

657
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:07,642
-We need to go in!
-What's going on?

658
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,393
-What's this?
-What's going on?

659
00:48:09,477 --> 00:48:10,937
-What's this?
-Coming through.

660
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,772
Make way, please.

661
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:14,732
What? What's going on?

662
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:17,234
I came to pick up the bowls.

663
00:48:17,568 --> 00:48:19,612
-Let him pass.
-Let him pass!

664
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:22,156
<i>What, are you going to kill him?</i>

665
00:48:22,907 --> 00:48:24,325
<i>Of course.</i>

666
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:26,410
<i>Are you willing to kill the students too?</i>

667
00:48:26,494 --> 00:48:27,995
<i>The girls' lives are not important.</i>

668
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,748
<i>If the election goes wrong,</i>

669
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:33,918
<i>he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!</i>

670
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:36,963
We need to send this into the dorm.

671
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:38,714
And if it's revealed--

672
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:41,425
Wait. You'll give it to the spies?

673
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:36,272
What's the emergency frequency
you and your fiancée use?

674
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,152
What's the rush?
You gave her until tomorrow morning.

675
00:49:41,235 --> 00:49:42,445
We're running out of time.

676
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:46,115
I need to see
if it's possible to get the proof.

677
00:49:47,575 --> 00:49:48,826
What's the frequency?

678
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,043
It's 44.

679
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:11,182
Han-na.

680
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,184
<i>Han-na, do you hear me?</i>

681
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:18,397
Mr. Lee? What's going on?

682
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:19,940
Did you get the proof?

683
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:21,776
Yes, I got it.

684
00:50:25,237 --> 00:50:27,114
We found the delivery bike.

685
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:30,576
Damn it.

686
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:37,374
Damn it.

687
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,425
I filmed Tae-il
and the released hostages being taken.

688
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:49,053
-Give me a gun.
-Here, sir.

689
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:04,985
You son of a b****.

690
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:08,656
<i>I went easy on you for old times' sake,</i>

691
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:10,449
and you betrayed me?

692
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:15,996
Come on. What's wrong, sir?

693
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,581
What's this about?

694
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:19,583
Why are you with this bastard?

695
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,335
<i>Are you working with him?</i>

696
00:51:21,418 --> 00:51:23,546
<i>-What are you talking about?
-Hey!</i>

697
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,841
<i>-Take her too.
-Yes, sir.</i>

698
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:29,635
What are you doing? Let go of me!

699
00:51:29,718 --> 00:51:32,012
We found a bug in the camp.

700
00:51:32,096 --> 00:51:35,015
-Let go!
-What are you waiting for? Get out.

701
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,183
Stay still.

702
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,686
<i>-Get out!
-If you take me,</i>

703
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:43,190
<i>my company won't just sit still.
This is suppressing free speech!</i>

704
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:47,027
Han-na must've been caught.

705
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:50,739
She's in danger because of you!

706
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:53,701
Sit.

707
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:56,912
Proof? What's the use of goddamn proof?

708
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:00,082
You know that they'll kill us all
nine days later.

709
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,500
You know they will.

710
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:07,214
Shut up.

711
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:10,718
The party guaranteed the safe return
to the North of all three of us.

712
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:14,555
Do you still not get it?

713
00:52:15,556 --> 00:52:17,141
Are you that stupid?

714
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:20,978
Right. I heard
you told Yeong-ro you'll leave

715
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:22,605
nine days later.

716
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:25,566
She asked why nine days later,

717
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:28,694
so I told her all this is
a scheme for the election.

718
00:52:29,904 --> 00:52:32,198
That her dad might kill all the hostages.

719
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:34,491
-You told her?
-What?

720
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:36,327
You feel bad for her?

721
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:38,454
On top of her brother's death,

722
00:52:38,537 --> 00:52:42,875
she found out that her dad might kill
all her friends. She must be going crazy.

723
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:46,420
She was already blaming herself for this.

724
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:48,672
She must just want to die.

725
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:50,966
You bastard.

726
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:57,973
It's hard, isn't it?

727
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,143
I'm sure it's hard for you too.

728
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,647
Because you love Yeong-ro.

729
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:11,946
Shut up.

730
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:13,697
You think I'm a turncoat?

731
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:15,658
Does loving the girl who saved you
make you a turncoat?

732
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:20,454
Your party traded
their loyal agents for money.

733
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:23,791
What about them?

734
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:46,605
You're the ANSP team leader.

735
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:56,282
The ANSP frames and kills those who
fight against the tyranny of the regime.

736
00:54:00,452 --> 00:54:01,954
You're the regime's hounds

737
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:05,499
that trample on innocent people's lives
to make the security state.

738
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,044
That's what the ANSP is.

739
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:13,132
And you're their agent.
You have no right to blame me.

740
00:54:20,472 --> 00:54:22,975
In the end, they're all the same.

741
00:54:23,767 --> 00:54:25,477
On the pretext of repatriation,

742
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,063
the North deceived
countless Korean-Japanese

743
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:30,316
and trampled on their lives.

744
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:34,653
The South made the security state.

745
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:48,751
Lim Soo-ho.

746
00:54:53,255 --> 00:54:55,007
You must wake up now.

747
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:58,469
Lives of mere pawns like us…

748
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:00,220
-We must--
-No.

749
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:03,682
"We"?

750
00:55:06,852 --> 00:55:08,354
You and I are enemies.

751
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,751
Would you like some?

752
00:55:31,335 --> 00:55:32,836
I'm not hungry.

753
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:37,174
Didn't you say you'll rip me to shreds?

754
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:44,306
I said some harsh words… I admit it.

755
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:48,811
How did you find out?

756
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:51,438
The room inside your office.

757
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,568
It's quite impressive.

758
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,325
Please keep it

759
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:05,536
from the students.

760
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,121
Of course.

761
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:10,541
You work for my agency after all.

762
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,628
How could a mere agent like me

763
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:16,588
blow your cover?

764
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,675
We're on the same side.

765
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:23,345
Mr. Lee.

766
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:26,140
Since both of our lives
are in their hands,

767
00:56:26,223 --> 00:56:27,724
let me tell you something.

768
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:31,603
Though I yielded to their power
since I'm weak,

769
00:56:32,104 --> 00:56:35,983
I still think they're evil people who
frame the innocent to climb the ladder.

770
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,693
I've never…

771
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,363
sold my students out to them.

772
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,661
Then,

773
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:50,789
Let's save the students…

774
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:53,834
together.

775
00:57:02,301 --> 00:57:03,343
Save?

776
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:10,350
Hey.

777
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:12,352
Go back to where you were.

778
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,453
<i>I didn't plant the bug!</i>

779
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:32,706
So how can I have any tape to give you?

780
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:35,000
When you

781
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:37,211
disguised yourself as a delivery guy

782
00:57:37,711 --> 00:57:41,423
and came in to film Mr. Nam with this,

783
00:57:42,216 --> 00:57:44,426
you planted the bug, you bastard!

784
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:49,056
Damn.

785
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:54,520
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've just planted my bug.

786
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:56,480
COSMOS TOYS

787
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:58,440
Let's get to work.

788
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:05,155
Dong-jae. Oh Dong-jae!

789
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:07,699
Open this! Come on!

790
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:09,493
Open up!

791
00:58:11,495 --> 00:58:12,704
Open it!

792
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:25,045
Comrade Joo. It's time to patrol.

793
01:00:25,128 --> 01:00:28,006
<i>It was "Bimok,"
so beautiful that it makes you sad.</i>

794
01:00:28,632 --> 01:00:31,259
<i>On a sunny and weedy corner
of a mountain foot,</i>

795
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:34,805
<i>there was a wooden cross
on a nameless soldier's grave.</i>

796
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:36,765
<i>And the song was inspired--</i>

797
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:43,855
Polka Dot.

798
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:51,571
You're quite a good singer. Sing it again.

799
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:54,157
Look.

800
01:00:54,408 --> 01:00:56,827
My name is Ko Hye-ryeong, not Polka Dot.

801
01:00:57,661 --> 01:01:00,205
Besides, I don't sing
without any accompaniment.

802
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,916
-I'm Hosu's Maria Callas.
-Maria Callas!

803
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:05,460
Is anyone willing

804
01:01:05,544 --> 01:01:07,587
to play piano for Hye-ryeong?

805
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:10,716
You're good at it.

806
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:13,176
I'll play it for you.

807
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:25,856
<i>The cannon and gun smoke
swept the deep vale</i>

808
01:01:26,565 --> 01:01:29,109
<i>At the sunny place…</i>

809
01:01:29,192 --> 01:01:31,069
I don't think it'll work.

810
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:35,323
But that's the safest place to hide.

811
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:39,286
I doubt Yeong-ro will tell them easily.

812
01:01:40,036 --> 01:01:42,247
She's even hiding that
she's the ANSP director's daughter.

813
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:46,126
This is a scheme for the election!

814
01:01:47,127 --> 01:01:49,129
How long will you dance
to the ANSP's tune?

815
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:57,846
How on earth will you lose Kang Cheong-ya?

816
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:06,772
<i>-There has been
-There has been</i>

817
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:11,651
<i>-Moss at every joint and frown
-Moss at every joint and frown</i>

818
01:02:16,114 --> 01:02:17,240
Quiet!

819
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:27,501
Well, what about the second verse?

820
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:56,780
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

821
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,412
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

822
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:06,373
but can I go to the restroom?

823
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:08,041
I can't hold it.

824
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:09,459
Lie down.

825
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:24,641
I need to go to the restroom.

826
01:03:32,899 --> 01:03:34,734
Those who need to go, come all at once.

827
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:36,528
This is the last time.

828
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:18,403
Hey, cadet.

829
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:23,909
We'll escape tomorrow.

830
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,119
The hall director knows it.

831
01:04:26,202 --> 01:04:29,706
Joo, the one who took them
to the restroom. You take care of him.

832
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,666
Us?

833
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,626
Got it?

834
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:35,253
Go.

835
01:04:58,818 --> 01:05:00,862
8 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION

836
01:05:36,314 --> 01:05:37,440
What are you doing?

837
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:40,694
For them to keep fit,

838
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:42,904
they should do this at least.

839
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,572
Everyone sit.

840
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:46,241
We're not livestock!

841
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:48,743
You keep us here
without letting us wash up.

842
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:50,286
This is a human rights abuse!

843
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:52,414
For days,

844
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:54,666
we haven't even brushed our teeth.

845
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:58,128
It's hard to sleep here,

846
01:05:58,211 --> 01:05:59,963
but what's worse is the smell.

847
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:01,965
Can we wash up?

848
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:05,510
I've never spent four days
without brushing my teeth.

849
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:07,971
-Please.
-Seriously.

850
01:06:08,054 --> 01:06:09,931
-Just this once.
-Please.

851
01:06:10,015 --> 01:06:12,267
-I feel so itchy.
-I can't take it anymore.

852
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,269
-Please.
-I'll be obedient.

853
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:16,604
-Please.
-Let us wash up.

854
01:06:16,688 --> 01:06:18,648
-I feel so itchy.
-Please.

855
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:21,317
We'll feel better
if you let us wash our faces.

856
01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:24,404
You can let us do that much, right?

857
01:06:24,487 --> 01:06:26,156
Are you out of your mind, you brats?

858
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:33,955
Fine.

859
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,458
Ten people at a time.

860
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,419
Do anything funny,
and the rest will get hurt.

861
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:41,755
Our basins are in our rooms.

862
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:43,757
Can we stop by our rooms?

863
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,009
But don't go above the second floor.

864
01:06:47,427 --> 01:06:48,636
First group of ten.

865
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,138
-Me!
-Me!

866
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:51,723
-Me first!
-Me first!

867
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:53,183
-Me first!
-Me first!

868
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:55,310
-Me!
-Me!

869
01:06:55,393 --> 01:06:57,520
-Me first!
-Me first!

870
01:06:57,604 --> 01:06:58,855
Stand in a line in front of me.

871
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:02,734
-Move.
-Number!

872
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:05,487
Call out numbers!

873
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:07,030
One.

874
01:07:07,697 --> 01:07:09,074
-Two.
-Three.

875
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:10,909
-Four.
-Five.

876
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:18,583
-Why are we running?
-Ko Hye-ryeong!

877
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,212
-Let's go to our room on the 3rd floor.
-What? But…

878
01:07:22,295 --> 01:07:23,963
I forgot where I put my toothbrush.

879
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:27,258
It's okay. I have a new one,
so don't worry. Let's go.

880
01:07:41,189 --> 01:07:42,107
Well,

881
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:46,820
my room's next to the washing room.
Can I stop by for a second?

882
01:07:47,987 --> 01:07:49,864
You must stay on the second floor.

883
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,246
I'm not a student here,

884
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:59,290
so I have no one to borrow anything from.

885
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:05,964
Where's your room?

886
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,175
On basement one.

887
01:08:10,844 --> 01:08:12,554
Just kill me.

888
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:14,305
I won't get out.

889
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:16,266
I didn't know my bed felt this nice.

890
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:20,520
Should we tell them
to let us sleep in our rooms from now on?

891
01:08:20,812 --> 01:08:22,856
That's just what you would say.

892
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:24,274
You think we're camping?

893
01:08:24,357 --> 01:08:25,775
I was just joking, you wench.

894
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:27,986
Yeong-ro, are you looking for something?

895
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,905
Seol-hui, have you seen my electric watch?

896
01:08:31,531 --> 01:08:32,699
Your watch?

897
01:08:32,782 --> 01:08:34,409
Right! The bag.

898
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:36,202
It must be in the red bag.

899
01:09:16,534 --> 01:09:17,785
Don't run!

900
01:09:17,869 --> 01:09:18,995
What?

901
01:09:19,078 --> 01:09:20,830
You can't stop me!

902
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:25,668
Thank…

903
01:09:26,628 --> 01:09:29,547
Thank you for last time.

904
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:39,057
No one's ever taken my side before.

905
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:43,311
Thank you.

906
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:45,855
I mean it.

907
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:55,281
My room is over there.

908
01:09:58,326 --> 01:09:59,327
Go.

909
01:12:08,748 --> 01:12:10,541
My thigh's strong enough

910
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:12,460
to stop bullets now.

911
01:12:15,588 --> 01:12:17,423
Ouch, that hurts.

912
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:20,968
Go in! Now!

913
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,640
Eun Yeong-ro ran away.

914
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:29,894
-What?
-Room 207.

915
01:12:31,396 --> 01:12:32,814
Have you seen Yeong-ro?

916
01:12:33,856 --> 01:12:36,442
She went to the washroom first.

917
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,360
Follow me.

918
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:44,033
-Where's she?
-What's going on?

919
01:12:44,117 --> 01:12:45,660
Quiet!

920
01:12:45,743 --> 01:12:47,787
Sit down!

921
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:50,498
-If you move, I'll shoot you!
-Hey.

922
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,792
You bastard!

923
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:56,462
You bastard!

924
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,297
You little…

925
01:13:02,885 --> 01:13:04,679
-Untie me!
-Okay.

926
01:13:11,602 --> 01:13:12,728
Ma'am.

927
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:14,522
What's going on?

928
01:13:14,605 --> 01:13:16,691
Guys, come here. Now!

929
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:18,025
Hurry!

930
01:13:18,109 --> 01:13:20,278
-Gather!
-Now!

931
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:23,030
-Hurry!
-Tie him up!

932
01:13:23,614 --> 01:13:24,740
What?

933
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:26,993
Eun Yeong-ro!

934
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:35,793
Eun Yeong-ro!

935
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:40,882
<i>We're going to escape from the dorm.</i>

936
01:13:40,965 --> 01:13:43,426
Listen carefully. In the prayer room,

937
01:13:43,509 --> 01:13:45,553
there's a secret passage
you don't know about.

938
01:13:45,636 --> 01:13:48,139
Through that passage,
go down to the basement one.

939
01:13:48,222 --> 01:13:51,184
And take the central staircase
and go out through the main door.

940
01:13:51,476 --> 01:13:53,102
This might be our last chance.

941
01:13:53,186 --> 01:13:56,564
Don't be scattered, and move as one.

942
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:57,607
Quietly.

943
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:00,109
Hurry up! Go!

944
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:02,403
Hurry up! Go!

945
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:03,696
Go!

946
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:08,618
Go!

947
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:31,641
RESTROOM

948
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:33,226
What's going on?

949
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,145
Yeong-ro's in the room
on the fourth floor.

950
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:39,857
The ANSP decided
to get you and her out of here first.

951
01:14:42,026 --> 01:14:43,653
I'll tell you more once we get there.

952
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:58,042
Yeong-ro?

953
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:03,589
Yeong-ro?

954
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:06,884
RESTRICTED

955
01:15:41,419 --> 01:15:43,421
Go down the stairs.

956
01:15:43,504 --> 01:15:45,047
Watch your step.

957
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:46,674
-Stairs?
-Follow her.

958
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:49,385
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

959
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:50,595
Be careful.

960
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:52,638
-Be careful.
-Watch your step.

961
01:16:38,017 --> 01:16:40,811
Of course,
they wouldn't be hiding it there.

962
01:16:45,024 --> 01:16:47,735
Where would they have hidden
the money bag?

963
01:16:47,985 --> 01:16:50,780
I definitely smell money around here.

964
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,872
Go lock the door! Now!

965
01:17:05,294 --> 01:17:07,797
Hey, hurry up. Lock it!

966
01:17:08,506 --> 01:17:10,007
Hurry!

967
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,348
You bastards!

968
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:23,813
RESTRICTED

969
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:38,202
Eun Yeong-ro!

970
01:19:10,503 --> 01:19:11,337
Eun Yeong-ro.

971
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:25,017
Answer me.

972
01:19:26,101 --> 01:19:27,311
You're in there, right?

973
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:38,197
I must find you first to save you.

974
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:40,074
Yeong-ro.

975
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:43,786
Answer me. Please.

976
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:17,611
We need to come up with a code.

977
01:20:19,697 --> 01:20:22,157
Knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock.

978
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:25,786
If you hear two knocks and then three,
it's me, Yeong-ro.

979
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:28,998
And you need to open
the door right away. Agreed?

980
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:32,042
Agreed.

981
01:20:46,724 --> 01:20:48,309
Answer me. Please.

982
01:21:56,043 --> 01:21:58,128
You little bastard.

983
01:22:19,817 --> 01:22:20,859
What?

984
01:22:42,297 --> 01:22:43,716
Where's the detonator?

985
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,301
Where is it?

986
01:22:56,895 --> 01:22:58,731
Guys, let's clear the way.

987
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:00,232
Take it.

988
01:23:06,822 --> 01:23:07,990
Wait!

989
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:14,997
Everyone.

990
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:18,333
The square thing attached to the door.

991
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,335
It's connected to a thread.

992
01:23:21,086 --> 01:23:22,046
That's a bomb.

993
01:23:22,129 --> 01:23:24,089
-Oh, my God!
-Don't move!

994
01:23:24,798 --> 01:23:26,592
Be careful!

995
01:23:28,844 --> 01:23:30,304
Come on!

996
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,723
Do something about it!

997
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:34,183
-Come on!
-Hurry!

998
01:23:34,266 --> 01:23:36,602
-Come on!
-Do something!

999
01:23:36,977 --> 01:23:38,562
Is that really a bomb?

1000
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:41,273
-You're a cadet. Do something!
-I don't know how.

1001
01:23:41,356 --> 01:23:43,233
-Come on! Hurry!
-But I…

1002
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,652
-Please. Do something!
-How can I…

1003
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:48,197
-Do something!
-There's a bomb!

1004
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,323
Cadet!

1005
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:51,033
-Cadet!
-Yes?

1006
01:23:52,576 --> 01:23:54,244
What do we do?

1007
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:55,662
Wait.

1008
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,342
Come down here!

1009
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:23,357
Don't move.

1010
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:28,570
What?

1011
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:35,577
Don't move.

1012
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:40,624
I'll shoot you.

1013
01:24:40,707 --> 01:24:41,917
I'll really shoot you.

1014
01:24:46,588 --> 01:24:47,673
Hurry up.

1015
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:52,094
-Hurry up. Please.
-Hey.

1016
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:54,596
Don't move.

1017
01:25:00,644 --> 01:25:02,855
-It's open!
-Sir!

1018
01:25:02,938 --> 01:25:03,772
-Sir.
-Yes?

1019
01:25:03,856 --> 01:25:05,440
Lead the students and go out first.

1020
01:25:05,524 --> 01:25:06,692
Hurry!

1021
01:25:06,775 --> 01:25:08,777
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

1022
01:25:18,829 --> 01:25:20,706
Hurry! Go!

1023
01:25:21,498 --> 01:25:23,333
Everyone stop!

1024
01:25:33,093 --> 01:25:34,678
Everyone stop.

1025
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:37,347
Comrade Kang.

1026
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,607
Don't move.

1027
01:25:48,108 --> 01:25:49,902
If anyone moves…

1028
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:58,952
What is this?

1029
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:02,581
You want us all to die together?

1030
01:26:08,587 --> 01:26:10,172
Damn it.

1031
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:11,215
What the hell.

1032
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,351
What if the hostages all died?

1033
01:26:22,434 --> 01:26:24,978
Bombs exploded. I don't think

1034
01:26:25,145 --> 01:26:27,481
only 13 people died.

1035
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:29,483
Only 13 must die.

1036
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:31,109
Exactly 13.

1037
01:26:31,193 --> 01:26:32,861
<i>We hear more and more heartbreaking news</i>

1038
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:36,031
<i>about those who still don't know
if their children are alive.</i>

1039
01:26:36,114 --> 01:26:37,574
You lunatic!

1040
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:40,202
<i>You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?</i>

1041
01:26:40,285 --> 01:26:42,996
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

1042
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,539
<i>Since when did we</i>

1043
01:26:44,873 --> 01:26:47,417
<i>only do as agreed with the South?</i>

1044
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:50,087
Besides, the South's goal is

1045
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,588
to win the election,

1046
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:53,924
not to save the hostages' lives.

1047
01:26:55,092 --> 01:26:56,802
There's no way my father would…

1048
01:27:00,264 --> 01:27:01,765
<i>Dead or alive…</i>

1049
01:27:03,892 --> 01:27:05,477
<i>We're in the same boat now.</i>
