00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:46.741 line:85.83%,end
What's your name?

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.253 line:85.83%,end
We agents shouldn't even ask
each other's names.

00:54:58.753 --> 00:54:59.921 line:85.83%,end
You know that.

00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:01.756 line:85.83%,end
I'm Kang Cheong-ya.

00:55:02.507 --> 00:55:05.385 line:85.83%,end
My grandfather, who was
an independence activist, named me so

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:06.970 line:85.83%,end
hoping I'd prepare for crises.

00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:10.223 line:85.83%,end
-That's not my real name though.
-I didn't hear that.

00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:19.190 line:85.83%,end
That necklace…

00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:21.818 line:85.83%,end
Can you give it to--

00:55:23.194 --> 00:55:24.571 line:85.83%,end
No, can you sell it to me?

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.201 line:85.83%,end
After another ideology education

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.621 line:85.83%,end
and intensive training,
I'll have to go back to Seoul.

00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:37.417 line:85.83%,end
And I have a feeling

00:55:39.252 --> 00:55:41.588 line:85.83%,end
-that will keep me alive.
-I'm sorry,

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:46.426 line:85.83%,end
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

00:55:50.472 --> 00:55:51.514 line:85.83%,end
If…

00:55:55.477 --> 00:55:57.854 line:85.83%,end
If we ever meet again,

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:00.523 line:85.83%,end
I will repay you…

00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.110 line:85.83%,end
for saving my life.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.029 line:85.83%,end
Did you want to see me, sir?

00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:53.326 line:85.83%,end
What I'm about to tell you

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.454 line:85.83%,end
must stay between you and me
for the time being.

00:56:57.455 --> 00:56:58.623 line:85.83%,end
I understand, sir.

00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:02.085 line:85.83%,end
You'll be officially appointed
as chief of the OPC tomorrow.

00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:05.088 line:85.83%,end
Come up with 300 million dollars
with secret funds right away.

00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:08.758 line:85.83%,end
300 million dollars?

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.176 line:85.83%,end
But that much money--

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.846 line:85.83%,end
You know that the hostage situation
is the election scheme.

00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:15.807 line:85.83%,end
Treat it as working expenses,
and there'll be no problem.

00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:18.768 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir.

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.898 line:85.83%,end
Oh, and, let's have a drink together soon.

00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:51.134 line:85.83%,end
You're just watching this guy
ripping the squid for me.

00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:54.179 line:85.83%,end
You're witless and tactless.

00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:57.307 line:85.83%,end
You're just feisty. That's all you are.
My goodness.

00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:01.227 line:85.83%,end
Hey. What did you come here again for?

00:58:01.686 --> 00:58:03.396 line:85.83%,end
You should rest at home.

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.482 line:85.83%,end
Give me the camcorder.

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:11.613 line:85.83%,end
Right. You want to see
your daughter's face? Here.

00:58:12.197 --> 00:58:13.323 line:85.83%,end
Have one.

00:58:15.575 --> 00:58:16.743 line:85.83%,end
The camcorder.

00:58:19.412 --> 00:58:22.499 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.
Now that we've calmed down the parents,

00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:25.001 line:85.83%,end
once we receive the camcorder,
everything will go--

00:58:25.084 --> 00:58:27.420 line:85.83%,end
-They didn't send it out yet?
-God, you startled me.

00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:31.049 line:85.83%,end
Those bastards just wouldn't listen to me.
How can I make them--

00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:34.010 line:85.83%,end
This damn bastard.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.722 line:85.83%,end
You bastard! What's taking you so long?

00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:39.557 line:85.83%,end
Send the camcorder out!

00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:40.850 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:42.435 line:85.83%,end
Send Han-na in.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.778 line:85.83%,end
I think a bowl of chicken soup
will heal me. No, it's okay!

00:58:58.117 --> 00:58:59.994 line:85.83%,end
What kind of chicken soup
do the South eat?

00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:03.373 line:85.83%,end
Chicken soup.

00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:04.624 line:85.83%,end
Chicken soup?

00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:09.003 line:85.83%,end
<i>Samgyetang?</i> Or old plain chicken soup?

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.138 line:85.83%,end
Along with 50 fried chickens.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.348 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:21.891 line:85.83%,end
Fried chicken?

00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.269 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind?

00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:26.020 line:85.83%,end
What a nerve they've got.

00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:27.522 line:85.83%,end
After the explosion, what?

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:29.190 line:85.83%,end
The reporters will find it odd too.

00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:32.193 line:85.83%,end
Sending in fried chicken after a gunfight…

00:59:32.277 --> 00:59:34.988 line:85.83%,end
Look. Just be grateful
for what we give you.

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.990 line:85.83%,end
We'll send in some snacks--

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.325 line:85.83%,end
We can send them in
without the reporters knowing.

00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:42.579 line:85.83%,end
It's possible if we use
the exit in the shrine.

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:46.249 line:85.83%,end
I'll make sure they won't find out.
