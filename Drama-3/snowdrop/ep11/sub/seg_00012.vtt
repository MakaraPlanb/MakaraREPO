01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.993 line:85.83%,end
How much is it? Hurry!

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.369 line:85.83%,end
It's 2,500 won.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.374 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry. I'll buy it next time.

01:06:05.252 --> 01:06:07.713 line:85.83%,end
<i>I wondered what it'd feel like</i>

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.216 line:85.83%,end
<i>to fall in love at first sight.</i>

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.428 line:85.83%,end
<i>But the moment I saw him,
I felt it right away.</i>

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.182 line:85.83%,end
<i>Our hands brushed just briefly,</i>

01:06:18.265 --> 01:06:20.643 line:85.83%,end
<i>but my heart began to pound.</i>

01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:24.021 line:85.83%,end
<i>Is this</i>

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.440 line:85.83%,end
<i>first love?</i>

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.653 line:85.83%,end
He must like

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:32.196 line:85.83%,end
paper airplanes too.

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:37.159 line:85.83%,end
It was such a shame
that I couldn't pick his paper airplane.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.120 line:85.83%,end
It really was.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:42.873 line:85.83%,end
But at Evergreen Bookstoreâ€¦

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:53.634 line:85.83%,end
Why did we have to bump into each other
then of all times?

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.137 line:85.83%,end
<i>What if I looked like a fool?</i>

01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:00.683 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's all right, Yeong-ro.
It was embarrassing,</i>

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.186 line:85.83%,end
but I got to see him again.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:14.447 line:85.83%,end
I felt like

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.449 line:85.83%,end
<i>my heart was going to explode.</i>

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:20.202 line:85.83%,end
<i>Does this mean</i>

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.748 line:85.83%,end
<i>we're meant to be together?</i>

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:26.000 line:85.83%,end
<i>Goodness.</i>

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.711 line:85.83%,end
Meant to be together?

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:30.838 line:85.83%,end
Jeong-min!

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.965 line:85.83%,end
You fell head over heels for him.

01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:15.466 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.429 line:85.83%,end
<i>-It's on. Mom!
-Mom!</i>

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.014 line:85.83%,end
<i>I didn't gain much weight.</i>

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:24.600 line:85.83%,end
<i>-She's on her second chicken.
-Stop it.</i>

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.811 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is so yummy.</i>

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.688 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll get out of here soon,
so take care until then.</i>

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.856 line:85.83%,end
<i>Got that?</i>

01:08:31.565 --> 01:08:34.193 line:85.83%,end
<i>My God, this is so freaking delicious.</i>

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.861 line:85.83%,end
<i>Thank you for the food!</i>

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:39.448 line:85.83%,end
So you filmed them
stuffing themselves with fried chicken?

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:41.909 line:85.83%,end
No, it wasn't me.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.579 line:85.83%,end
I was kept in the basement
until they gave it to me.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.041 line:85.83%,end
Those goddamn idiots.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:52.628 line:85.83%,end
They can't do anything right
except shooting guns.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.132 line:85.83%,end
How could they film it like this?
We can't air it on TV!

01:08:56.215 --> 01:09:00.302 line:85.83%,end
You should have told him it was for
raising awareness of national security.

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:04.431 line:85.83%,end
But you told him it was for calming
the parents down. So that happened.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.101 line:85.83%,end
Right!

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:11.313 line:85.83%,end
It's my fault. It's all my fault!

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.023 line:85.83%,end
I'm to blame.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:16.277 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my. I'm so sorry,
Mr. Chief of the OPS.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.321 line:85.83%,end
-Are you okay, sir?
-Hey.

01:09:19.405 --> 01:09:21.699 line:85.83%,end
He's been promoted to chief of the OPS.

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:23.617 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.828 line:85.83%,end
Unlike director positions,

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.664 line:85.83%,end
chief positions last long, they say.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.624 line:85.83%,end
<i>Yeong-ro, say something too.</i>

01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:34.712 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm Eun Yeong-ro, an English Literature
major and freshman from room 207.</i>

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.591 line:85.83%,end
<i>Dad, all of us are doing well in the dorm.</i>

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.676 line:85.83%,end
<i>We can't complain.</i>

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.971 line:85.83%,end
<i>But everyone wants to get out of here.</i>

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:48.142 line:85.83%,end
<i>And me too. I also want to get out badly.</i>

01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:51.854 line:85.83%,end
<i>We can all get out of here safely, right?</i>

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.064 line:85.83%,end
<i>When we get out of here,</i>

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:57.443 line:85.83%,end
<i>we'll be able to go home safely,</i>

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:58.986 line:85.83%,end
<i>right?</i>

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.114 line:85.83%,end
<i>Right, Dad?</i>

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:13.751 line:85.83%,end
Wait. My gosh.
