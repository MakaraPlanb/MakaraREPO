My sister was not a Northern spy.

00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:57.532 line:85.83%,end
She was not a Northern spy!

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.212 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:10.563 line:85.83%,end
You know that.
Our deal is based on give-and-take.

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.775 line:85.83%,end
I need to be sure
you'll get my daughter out first

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:16.528 line:85.83%,end
for me to send you
300 million dollars in three days.

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:19.781 line:85.83%,end
Thanks to your agent who got in the way,
our agents died

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:21.533 line:85.83%,end
and things got more complicated.

00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:23.743 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you think about it,
it's all come to this</i>

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.954 line:85.83%,end
<i>because you couldn't keep
your man under control.</i>

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.997 line:85.83%,end
If you don't send
300 million in three days,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.375 line:85.83%,end
your daughter will be killed first.

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:33.461 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Choi.

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.963 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Choi!

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.675 line:14.17%,start
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:48.184 line:85.83%,end
What about Kwon?
You still can't reach him?

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:58.027 line:85.83%,end
Since he went out for lunch,
we haven't been able to reach him.

00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.321 line:85.83%,end
How am I supposed to reach him then?

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.073 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:05.285 line:85.83%,end
If it's urgent, I'll have
an expenditure secretary go and--

00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:07.287 line:85.83%,end
It's not the kind of money
a mere expenditure--

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.834 line:85.83%,end
Search all over the city if you have to.
Find him as soon as possible!

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.085 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:20.884 line:85.83%,end
<i>Kim.</i>

00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:22.886 line:85.83%,end
Are you sure?

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:30.810 line:85.83%,end
Pick it up.
The President wants to talk to you.

00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.229 line:85.83%,end
Me? Why--

00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:35.523 line:85.83%,end
Just pick it up, you bastard.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.366 line:85.83%,end
This is Chief An Gyeong-hui
of Anti-communist Investigations speaking.

00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:49.537 line:85.83%,end
I heard you once cleaned up
after my son Jun-pyo. Is that true?

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:56.669 line:85.83%,end
The election is just around the corner,

00:29:57.295 --> 00:30:00.715 line:85.83%,end
so I couldn't let the opposition party
have anything to attack you with.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:04.552 line:85.83%,end
Besides, serving and protecting you,
the hero who saved our country,

00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:06.971 line:85.83%,end
is the most important job
of the ANSP, sir.

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:08.765 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:30:08.848 --> 00:30:11.267 line:85.83%,end
ANSP agents should strive
to ensure national security

00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:13.311 line:85.83%,end
<i>and protect our people.</i>

00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:15.021 line:85.83%,end
<i>To encourage you</i>

00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:17.816 line:85.83%,end
to be more faithful to your duties,

00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:21.611 line:85.83%,end
I'll appoint you
as the new chief of the Office

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:24.239 line:85.83%,end
of Planning and Coordination.

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:28.201 line:85.83%,end
Pardon, sir? Really, sir?

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:31.454 line:85.83%,end
I appreciate it, sir!

00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:36.084 line:85.83%,end
I swear to serve you loyally
until I die, sir!

00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.505 line:85.83%,end
And continue to be in charge of the case.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:45.009 line:85.83%,end
My wife said
your briefing seemed reliable.

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:46.553 line:85.83%,end
I'm honored, sir.

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:49.180 line:85.83%,end
I swear on my life
I'll do my best to make sure

00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:51.391 line:85.83%,end
this case ends well for you, sir.

00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:53.017 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.436 line:85.83%,end
Hey. Let me talk to him.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.604 line:85.83%,end
Give it.

00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:00.400 line:85.83%,end
Sir, this is Tae-il.

00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:10.577 line:85.83%,end
No, you're too kind, sir.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.287 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry about me, sir.

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.260 line:85.83%,end
What was that about?

00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:32.599 line:85.83%,end
What did he say
that you even swore on your life?

00:31:33.182 --> 00:31:37.312 line:85.83%,end
Well, it was justâ€¦ He just appointed me

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:40.565 line:85.83%,end
as the new chief of the Office
of Planning and Coordination.

00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:41.858 line:85.83%,end
Wow!

00:31:42.442 --> 00:31:45.028 line:85.83%,end
Chief of the OPC?
Then you're number two in the ANSP.

00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:46.112 line:85.83%,end
Stop that.

00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.864 line:85.83%,end
Congratulations, sir.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:49.949 line:85.83%,end
My gosh.
