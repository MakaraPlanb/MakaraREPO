00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:54.545 line:85.83%,end
this whole hostage situation
with the North

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.964 line:85.83%,end
to win the presidential election?

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.299 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

00:36:58.925 --> 00:36:59.800 line:85.83%,end
My Godâ€¦

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:03.471 line:85.83%,end
I was just ordered
to have Professor Han defect to the North.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.015 line:85.83%,end
I didn't come here to kill you

00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:09.393 line:85.83%,end
or hold you hostage here.

00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:12.647 line:85.83%,end
While being chased unexpectedly,

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.566 line:85.83%,end
I ended up holding you hostage.

00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:21.364 line:85.83%,end
Do you expect us to believe that?
You pointed a gun at us and held us down.

00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:24.367 line:85.83%,end
We were so scared.
And it was so hard for us.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.785 line:85.83%,end
-She's right!
-I agree!

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:27.411 line:85.83%,end
This is ridiculous!

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:29.372 line:85.83%,end
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:31.123 line:85.83%,end
"Take down the communist party.

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:32.792 line:85.83%,end
Defeat the Northern army!"

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:37.088 line:85.83%,end
This is the slogan we learned. There's
no way our government would do that!

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:41.467 line:85.83%,end
I know it's absurd and hard to believe,
but it is true.

00:37:42.176 --> 00:37:46.055 line:85.83%,end
I had no idea and escaped without
the spies knowing yesterday afternoon

00:37:46.138 --> 00:37:48.224 line:85.83%,end
to have the SWAT team
break in to save you.

00:37:48.808 --> 00:37:50.184 line:85.83%,end
But they shot at me.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.395 line:85.83%,end
-What?
-What's he talking about?

00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:55.022 line:85.83%,end
They shot at you, an ally?

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:55.940 line:85.83%,end
What did he say?

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:58.276 line:85.83%,end
My God.

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:06.409 line:85.83%,end
They're capable
of much worse things than this.

00:38:07.743 --> 00:38:10.246 line:85.83%,end
My cousin was a member
of the labor union at his work.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.832 line:85.83%,end
He was dragged
to the re-education camp and died.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.919 line:85.83%,end
They don't hesitate to kill
people who cross them.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.714 line:85.83%,end
Of course they're capable of this.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:26.637 line:85.83%,end
Whatever.

00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.140 line:85.83%,end
Whether it's true or not,
what's that have to do with me?

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.184 line:85.83%,end
Release me right now. I have to study.

00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:34.770 line:85.83%,end
The bar exam is soon!

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.232 line:85.83%,end
-Is she serious?
-Quiet!

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:43.487 line:85.83%,end
You have no idea how serious this is.
It's not the time to be selfish.

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:45.281 line:85.83%,end
If anything goes wrong,

00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:47.992 line:85.83%,end
the ANSP will kill us
as well as the spies.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.454 line:85.83%,end
If they can win the election,
30 people's lives?

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.124 line:85.83%,end
It's nothing to the ANSP.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.131 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:04.383 line:85.83%,end
I'll be straightforward.

00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:08.179 line:85.83%,end
So are you saying if we escape this place,

00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:12.475 line:85.83%,end
they're going to shoot at us
just like they did at him?

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.270 line:85.83%,end
I hope such a thing won't happen.

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:20.107 line:85.83%,end
But it might happen,
so I'm saying we should protect ourselves.

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.320 line:85.83%,end
The South or the North,

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:27.198 line:85.83%,end
the higher-ups don't give a damn
about our lives right now.

00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:40.127 line:85.83%,end
We have eight days left now.

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.880 line:85.83%,end
Eight days until the election.

00:39:43.422 --> 00:39:45.049 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee and I will find

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:48.094 line:85.83%,end
a way for us to get out alive until then.

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.264 line:85.83%,end
As of this moment,

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:55.476 line:85.83%,end
you're free to do whatever you want
within the dorm.

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:59.772 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget that
every entrance and exit is booby-trapped.

00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:02.024 line:85.83%,end
I know it's hard for all of you,

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.653 line:85.83%,end
but we must work together
if we're going to beat them.

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:09.698 line:85.83%,end
I hope no one will try
to escape alone to save their skin.

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:15.079 line:85.83%,end
I think you should supervise
the students from now on, Ms. Pi.

00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:19.083 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:21.877 line:85.83%,end
There's someone we need to punish first.

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.262 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok has a gun.

00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:34.306 line:85.83%,end
The doctor's underling
has been tormenting us.

00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:50.823 line:85.83%,end
The Gizzard joined the spies' side!

00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:53.868 line:85.83%,end
That b**** pointed a gun at us!

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.119 line:85.83%,end
Hye-ryeong.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.580 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi already knows.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.250 line:85.83%,end
She knows?

00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:06.922 line:85.83%,end
She's still going to let her be?

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:09.550 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi, you really know what she did?

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.386 line:85.83%,end
This is way worse than stealing!

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.929 line:85.83%,end
This is not right!

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:21.228 line:85.83%,end
Everyone, be quiet and sit down.

00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:38.621 line:85.83%,end
Starting tonight, you'll sleep
in the rooms on the second floor.

00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:40.581 line:85.83%,end
Those who don't have roommates,

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:42.583 line:85.83%,end
Gather in groups of four.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:45.878 line:85.83%,end
I'll sleep in my room.
