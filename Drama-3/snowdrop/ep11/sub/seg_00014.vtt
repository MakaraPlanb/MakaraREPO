01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.094 line:85.83%,end
Wait…

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:36.383 line:85.83%,end
<i>Who ordered to kill me?</i>

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.552 line:85.83%,end
That doesn't matter.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:42.222 line:85.83%,end
You were a card to discard to begin with.

01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:22.656 line:85.83%,end
I wanted to make you some coffee.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.978 line:85.83%,end
My mom used to love this coffee.

01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:57.691 line:85.83%,end
My dad's new wife

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.361 line:85.83%,end
threw out all of my mom's belongings.

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:05.323 line:85.83%,end
But I never let her throw this out
until the end.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:14.666 line:85.83%,end
Sitting still and
watching the coffee being made like this

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.962 line:85.83%,end
strangely makes me feel at ease.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:42.444 line:85.83%,end
How did you end up
becoming a secret agent?

01:19:52.412 --> 01:19:53.497 line:85.83%,end
It's just that…

01:19:54.539 --> 01:19:57.793 line:85.83%,end
you didn't have to take up
such a dangerous job.

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:21.358 line:85.83%,end
No one can choose their country
when they're born.

01:20:24.277 --> 01:20:26.154 line:85.83%,end
I was born there…

01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:30.826 line:85.83%,end
and given this job.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:39.125 line:85.83%,end
Can't you just quit
if you don't want to do it?

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.762 line:85.83%,end
<i>Have you ever killed a person?</i>

01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:54.808 line:85.83%,end
Pull the trigger, and it's over.

01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:56.434 line:85.83%,end
No.
