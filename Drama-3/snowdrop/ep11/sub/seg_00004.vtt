00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:43.135 line:85.83%,end
It's okay.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.399 line:85.83%,end
Have you ever killed a person?

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:00.777 line:85.83%,end
Pull the trigger, and it's over.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:01.820 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.072 line:85.83%,end
It's not over.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:09.494 line:85.83%,end
The eyes of the first person you kill
will haunt you forever.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.500 line:85.83%,end
The eyes of the person
whose life slips away…

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:20.422 line:85.83%,end
will follow you around
when you eat or sleep.

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:23.175 line:85.83%,end
Even in your dreams.

00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:27.012 line:85.83%,end
Your life will be a living hell
where you're chased

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.057 line:85.83%,end
by those eyes endlessly.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:34.978 line:85.83%,end
I am trying

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.356 line:85.83%,end
to save all of us here.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:41.693 line:85.83%,end
I'm trying to convince
Comrades Kang and Joo

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.404 line:85.83%,end
to save everyone in here

00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:47.866 line:85.83%,end
including all the hostages.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.371 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget, Bun-ok.

00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:55.582 line:85.83%,end
All the hostages must die here
for you and me

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:58.794 line:85.83%,end
to carry on without anyone
knowing what we did.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:01.838 line:85.83%,end
I'll take care of you until the end.

00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:04.132 line:85.83%,end
-You know I'm capable of that.
-Shut up.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.849 line:85.83%,end
Now I'll tell Soo-ho and the ANSP agent

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:15.394 line:85.83%,end
to put down their guns.

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:19.106 line:85.83%,end
If they don't, don't hesitate

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:22.651 line:85.83%,end
-to pull the trigger.
-Comrade Kang!

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.361 line:85.83%,end
-Drop your guns.
-Sit down!

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.782 line:85.83%,end
If they hear a gunshot, they'll break in.

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:31.326 line:85.83%,end
The cafeteria and room 203
are not guarded at all.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.078 line:85.83%,end
They'll hold us down in three minutes.

00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.998 line:85.83%,end
-You'll be arrested in three minutes.
-Don't be fooled.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.917 line:85.83%,end
They'll never break in.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.752 line:85.83%,end
They haven't until now. Can't you see?

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.548 line:85.83%,end
If they don't drop them in three seconds,
shoot her.

00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:46.174 line:85.83%,end
One.

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.427 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok…

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.220 line:85.83%,end
Two.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:52.222 line:85.83%,end
Drop your guns now!

00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.099 line:85.83%,end
I'll really shoot her.

00:23:54.182 --> 00:23:55.809 line:85.83%,end
You don't think I can?

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:03.650 line:85.83%,end
Drop your guns!

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.465 line:85.83%,end
Good.

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.508 line:85.83%,end
Well done.

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:30.677 line:85.83%,end
Now,

00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:33.555 line:85.83%,end
bring Yeong-ro here.

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:40.979 line:85.83%,end
Don't.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:48.862 line:85.83%,end
Step back.

00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:52.491 line:85.83%,end
Move back!

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:53.408 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.827 line:85.83%,end
Slowly. Take it easy.

00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:21.978 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.232 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:26.191 line:85.83%,end
Stay out of it.

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:29.277 line:85.83%,end
Where did you get that gun?
Put it down right now.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.820 line:85.83%,end
Shut your mouth.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:34.282 line:85.83%,end
Or I'll tell these guys
who you really are.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.576 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.371 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok. You must hurry. Come to this side.

00:25:39.454 --> 00:25:41.248 line:85.83%,end
Untie us first. Hurry.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.876 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind?

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:52.008 line:85.83%,end
Don't move!

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:09.568 line:85.83%,end
Shoot me then.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.491 line:85.83%,end
You don't think I can?

00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:19.953 line:85.83%,end
The doctor said she'll save my father.

00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:22.247 line:85.83%,end
I can't afford to miss this opportunity.

00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:25.000 line:85.83%,end
I'm not going to miss it.

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.711 line:85.83%,end
Is that so?
Then you're going to have to shoot me.

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:28.837 line:85.83%,end
Shoot!

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.847 line:85.83%,end
You foolish brat.

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:44.144 line:85.83%,end
Have you forgotten what happened to your
sister? Do you want to end up like her?
