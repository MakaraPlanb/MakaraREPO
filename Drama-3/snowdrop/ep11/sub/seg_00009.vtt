<i>-Give them back!
-Give them back!</i>

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:07.950 line:85.83%,end
Your father must've come too, right?

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.035 line:85.83%,end
Where is he?

00:47:10.118 --> 00:47:13.121 line:85.83%,end
Where is my future father-in-law?

00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:20.838 line:85.83%,end
He must be busy.
I think he's too busy to come.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.714 line:85.83%,end
I see.

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.425 line:85.83%,end
Are you upset about that?

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.053 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.
Oh Gwang-tae is here for you.

00:47:28.136 --> 00:47:29.930 line:85.83%,end
Mom!

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:34.643 line:85.83%,end
My goodness, I knew she'd be so shocked.

00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:36.645 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure she hasn't even
drunk a drop of water.

00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:38.689 line:85.83%,end
Mom…

00:47:38.772 --> 00:47:41.108 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness. My mom looks all haggard.

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:43.151 line:85.83%,end
I feel so bad for my dad too.

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.112 line:85.83%,end
Can't we just go outside?

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.072 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you hear the ANSP guy?

00:47:47.155 --> 00:47:49.116 line:85.83%,end
They'll shoot at us!

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:52.286 line:85.83%,end
Dream on.
We all know the doctor is a Northern spy.

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.328 line:85.83%,end
They won't let us go.

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:58.208 line:85.83%,end
Then we shouldn't trust
they're going to let us live?

00:47:58.292 --> 00:48:01.670 line:85.83%,end
Oh, poor Hye-ryeong.
You've been believing them all this time?

00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:06.425 line:85.83%,end
Look, in this situation, we can't
trust the ANSP agent or the spies.

00:48:06.508 --> 00:48:08.093 line:85.83%,end
They just want to save their skin.

00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:11.471 line:85.83%,end
Who knows? They might be not letting us go
to use us as shields.

00:48:12.347 --> 00:48:14.016 line:85.83%,end
What do we do?

00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:15.434 line:85.83%,end
Look at that.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:16.602 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no.

00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:20.439 line:85.83%,end
<i>…if I think about the communists
who did those horrible things,</i>

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:24.568 line:85.83%,end
<i>I feel so furious
that I feel like I'm going to die.</i>

00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:27.404 line:85.83%,end
<i>Fellow citizens, we must become stronger.</i>

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.406 line:85.83%,end
<i>We need to become stronger</i>

00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:33.410 line:85.83%,end
<i>for the communists
to not even think about coming to hurt us.</i>

00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.789 line:85.83%,end
You picked the right person.
Did you have her rehearse it?

00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:40.709 line:85.83%,end
She caught on quickly,
so it wasn't difficult.

00:48:41.376 --> 00:48:42.878 line:85.83%,end
<i>Even in this desperate situation,</i>

00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:46.214 line:85.83%,end
<i>their anti-communism stays strong,
and it's moving to see.</i>

00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:51.053 line:85.83%,end
<i>In order not to let any Northern spy
or pro-Communist set foot in our country,</i>

00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:53.221 line:85.83%,end
<i>all of the citizens must cooperate.</i>

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.141 line:85.83%,end
Yes, they must cooperate.

00:48:56.224 --> 00:48:58.685 line:85.83%,end
I feel like I can hear
the approval rating going up.

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:01.939 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right.

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.524 line:85.83%,end
Have you found the recording?

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.987 line:85.83%,end
Gal is such a tenacious bastard,
so he's still holding out.

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:11.865 line:85.83%,end
But if we bring his mother
and threaten him,

00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:15.077 line:85.83%,end
what can he do? He'll talk soon.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.288 line:85.83%,end
<i>-We need all the citizens on full alert.</i>
-Come here.

00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:20.874 line:85.83%,end
<i>-I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>
-Come on.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.128 line:85.83%,end
I'm not going to hit you. Come here.

00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:33.178 line:85.83%,end
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what you're best at.

00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:37.057 line:85.83%,end
If a worm acts like a snake

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.559 line:85.83%,end
and aspires to become a dragon,
it'll end up getting hurt.

00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:43.438 line:85.83%,end
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.

00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:53.240 line:85.83%,end
We're not going to make it
without Han-na's help.

00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:55.367 line:85.83%,end
We need to bring her in first.

00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:00.163 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.374 line:85.83%,end
But I don't think

00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:06.044 line:85.83%,end
you should tell her
Kang Cheong-ya is a Northern spy.

00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:07.254 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean?

00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:11.967 line:85.83%,end
Han-na must know that
to find out who's behind Kang.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.637 line:85.83%,end
And we need to find that out
to use it as our winning move.

00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:18.432 line:85.83%,end
If Nam Tae-il finds out
Kang is a Northern spy,

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.392 line:85.83%,end
he's going to try to kill all the hostages

00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:23.145 line:85.83%,end
before we could make our winning move.

00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:25.439 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il?

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:28.025 line:85.83%,end
He's the one who sent Kang in here.

00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:38.326 line:85.83%,end
She's infiltrated that deep?

00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.871 line:85.83%,end
I never imagined…

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.665 line:85.83%,end
Then she's a step away
from entering the Blue House.

00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.752 line:85.83%,end
You think you can convince Kang Cheong-ya?

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.720 line:85.83%,end
Do you want to die?

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.724 line:85.83%,end
How could you help
the traitor who fell for a girl--

00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:04.770 line:85.83%,end
Say what you will about Comrade Lim,
but I trust him!

00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:07.105 line:85.83%,end
He saved me during the training.

00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:08.940 line:85.83%,end
And he's the only one
who'll save me again!

00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:10.275 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:51:10.358 --> 00:51:12.444 line:85.83%,end
Untie me before I beat you to death.

00:51:12.527 --> 00:51:13.945 line:85.83%,end
Untie me, you bastard!

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:14.988 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:19.451 line:85.83%,end
I don't think he can hear you yet,
so stop it.

00:51:27.667 --> 00:51:30.253 line:85.83%,end
<i>Eliminate Taedong River 1?</i>

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.569 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no!
