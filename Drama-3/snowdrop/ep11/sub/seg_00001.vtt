00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.470 line:85.83%,end
Even just a piece of bread.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.932 line:85.83%,end
-You'll be blessed.
-Yes.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.694 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Ko Hye-ja.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.956 line:85.83%,end
You said I shouldn't carry
an English book around

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.918 line:85.83%,end
or receive the school newspaper
since I'm not a college student.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.298 line:85.83%,end
You said I should know my place.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.804 line:85.83%,end
Why are you bringing that up now?

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.890 line:85.83%,end
Shut it. You don't get any food.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.852 line:85.83%,end
-Yoon Seol-hui!
-Yes?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.022 line:85.83%,end
Did you call me?

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.861 line:85.83%,end
Hand out what you're holding
to the hostages.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.449 line:85.83%,end
And make sure
you don't give Ko Hye-ja any.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.288 line:85.83%,end
You don't give whom any again?

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.500 line:85.83%,end
Ko…

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.960 line:85.83%,end
Ko Hye-ja…

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.572 line:85.83%,end
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.576 line:85.83%,end
This won't do. Demand some more food.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.876 line:85.83%,end
Stand up.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.054 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.943 line:85.83%,end
You're betraying your country in the end?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.403 line:85.83%,end
They traded the South our lives for money

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.365 line:85.83%,end
while they guaranteed us our safe return.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.409 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.495 line:85.83%,end
They've disposed of their own agents.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.330 line:85.83%,end
Shut your mouth.

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:04.210 line:85.83%,end
How dare you traitor bastard
insult our party?

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.063 line:85.83%,end
It seems Lim Soo-ho betrayed you.

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:26.315 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP agent's putting
a gun to the doctor's head.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.441 line:85.83%,end
A gun?

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:31.153 line:85.83%,end
And she called Soo-ho a traitor.
I heard it clearly.

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:34.949 line:85.83%,end
Keep an eye on the hostages.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.788 line:85.83%,end
What is it? What's going on?

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:44.667 line:85.83%,end
Everyone, hands over your heads.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.502 line:85.83%,end
And keep your heads down!

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:51.841 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.843 line:85.83%,end
Keep a close watch on the hostages.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.099 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down!
