00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.285 line:85.83%,end
There are no connections

00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.787 line:85.83%,end
between you and him whatsoever.

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:58.833 line:85.83%,end
What, did you give the First Lady
some valuable information?

00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:03.129 line:85.83%,end
You should watch what you say.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:08.176 line:85.83%,end
The President is suffering from rumors

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:11.471 line:85.83%,end
that he's appointed his closest man
as chief of the OPC,

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:14.349 line:85.83%,end
controlling the ANSP
with his power of appointment and money.

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.017 line:85.83%,end
You know that.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.354 line:85.83%,end
If you think that way,
it can't be good for the President.

00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:30.490 line:85.83%,end
Look at this bastard.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.368 line:85.83%,end
You're one sly bastard, aren't you?

00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:36.871 line:85.83%,end
I thought you were small fry,
but you're actually a sly snake?

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.292 line:85.83%,end
When you deal with a snake,

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.795 line:85.83%,end
you shouldn't step on its tail.

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.756 line:85.83%,end
When it lifts its head,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.551 line:85.83%,end
you must trample on it
mercilessly to kill it. Got that?

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:01.521 line:85.83%,end
Damn it…

00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.690 line:85.83%,end
What? Adultery?

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:07.777 line:85.83%,end
He transferred tens of accounts
to Hanju Bank Sogong Branch lately,

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.237 line:85.83%,end
so I thought it was weird.

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.280 line:85.83%,end
He and the female branch manager…

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:12.865 line:85.83%,end
Where's Kwon right now?

00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:15.493 line:85.83%,end
His wife sued him for adultery,

00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:18.413 line:85.83%,end
so the police caught him red-handed
in a hotel earlier.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:30.258 line:85.83%,end
Who does the President have in mind
for the next chief of the OPC?

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:31.634 line:85.83%,end
Look into it secretly.

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:35.763 line:85.83%,end
I did, sir, and… it's unprecedented.

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:41.102 line:85.83%,end
We got intel that
Chief An Gyeong-hui has been appointed.

00:33:42.228 --> 00:33:43.521 line:85.83%,end
Chief An?

00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.566 line:85.83%,end
You are?

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.153 line:85.83%,end
You're going to be the Chief of the OPC?

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:53.322 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my God!

00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.952 line:85.83%,end
How amazing!

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.624 line:85.83%,end
The fortuneteller said you were likely

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.752 line:85.83%,end
to climb the ladder. He's so good!

00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:07.295 line:85.83%,end
I knew he was right!

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.463 line:85.83%,end
Really?

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.425 line:85.83%,end
Then, Charlotte, ask that fortuneteller

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:17.263 line:85.83%,end
if there's a way for that bastard
Nam Tae-il to drop dead.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.769 line:85.83%,end
That bastard kicked me in the shin again.
The same spot he kicked last time!

00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:24.937 line:85.83%,end
Honey, honey.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.815 line:85.83%,end
They say money will
take care of everything for you.

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:32.028 line:85.83%,end
You'll soon have an astronomical amount
of money at your disposal.

00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:33.321 line:85.83%,end
So what's the problem?

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:37.075 line:85.83%,end
What's that stupid Nam Tae-il?
He'll crawl to you. Just wait and see.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.036 line:85.83%,end
Listen, honey. I got to go.

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:42.330 line:85.83%,end
I should call the fortuneteller.

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:45.374 line:85.83%,end
Has Mr. An been promoted?

00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.126 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.129 line:85.83%,end
Not just any promotion.

00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:53.466 line:85.83%,end
The Chief of the OPC is
like Code 1's vault.

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:55.426 line:85.83%,end
Not just anyone can get the job.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.469 line:85.83%,end
Congratulations--

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:59.180 line:85.83%,end
Hello, sir. It's me.

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:02.350 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. How are you so good, sir?

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:05.186 line:85.83%,end
What you said has really happened.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.521 line:85.83%,end
Hello, ma'am.

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:09.732 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:12.485 line:85.83%,end
I'm thinking
of paying you a visit tomorrow.

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.362 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right.

00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:16.906 line:85.83%,end
Isn't it time for you
to get new golf clubs?

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.659 line:85.83%,end
What do you say to golden ones?

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:25.706 line:85.83%,end
It's my pleasure.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.584 line:85.83%,end
All right. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:37.510 line:85.83%,end
When did you come?

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.096 line:85.83%,end
What was it?

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:43.474 line:85.83%,end
What was with the golden golf clubs?

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:47.645 line:85.83%,end
If you bribe someone carelessly,
you might get into trouble later.

00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.441 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry,

00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:55.987 line:85.83%,end
but I have to go shopping now.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:59.115 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Kim. Fit Ms. Cho for me, okay?

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.452 line:85.83%,end
What? That's wrong. Just wrong!

00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:05.163 line:85.83%,end
How could you leave it to her?

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:08.791 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Kim.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.919 line:85.83%,end
Push Ms. Cho's fitting back

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.130 line:85.83%,end
to the day after tomorrow.

00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:17.091 line:85.83%,end
All right? Since I have
no time tomorrow too. Move.

00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:21.888 line:85.83%,end
Well, then.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.558 line:85.83%,end
Is she out of her mind?

00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:26.976 line:85.83%,end
What's wrong with her?

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:28.561 line:85.83%,end
Has she gone insane?

00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:31.898 line:85.83%,end
Apparently, her husband has been
promoted to chief of the OPC.

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.942 line:85.83%,end
Chief of the OPC? Mr. An has?

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:40.156 line:85.83%,end
But how? He wasn't that good.

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:42.700 line:85.83%,end
My goodness!

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.832 line:85.83%,end
What? So are you saying

00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:51.792 line:85.83%,end
our government planned
