01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.358 line:85.83%,end
Where's Mr. Lee?

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.610 line:85.83%,end
Put them in and leave.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.542 line:85.83%,end
Put the gun down.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:38.926 line:85.83%,end
Close the door.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.156 line:85.83%,end
What's this?

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:01.240 line:85.83%,end
It's chicken!

01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:13.795 line:85.83%,end
Where's Mr. Lee?

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.515 line:85.83%,end
God, I can't get used to this.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.726 line:85.83%,end
You're standing side by side with a spy.

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:30.645 line:85.83%,end
But I feel relieved.

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.652 line:85.83%,end
Let's eat first.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.618 line:85.83%,end
Why did you tell him I'm your fiancÃ©e?

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:48.121 line:85.83%,end
You had something to tell me.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.042 line:85.83%,end
But it's true

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.878 line:85.83%,end
we were engaged.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:02.969 line:85.83%,end
So you remember that.

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:07.807 line:85.83%,end
But why did you leave me?

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.613 line:85.83%,end
What's that?

01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:27.076 line:85.83%,end
What are they doing?

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:29.620 line:85.83%,end
-Oh, no.
<i>-Quiet!</i>

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:30.788 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.373 line:85.83%,end
<i>Keep in line.</i>

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.501 line:85.83%,end
<i>One, two, one, two. Keep in line.</i>

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.963 line:85.83%,end
Those who were released yesterday

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.216 line:85.83%,end
didn't go home.
They were taken to the ANSP.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:47.764 line:85.83%,end
Can you see now that this hostage
situation is a scheme for the election?

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:52.518 line:85.83%,end
They must want to show
how the students being held by the spies

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.979 line:85.83%,end
are trembling with fear on TV.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.731 line:85.83%,end
Once that is aired,

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.067 line:85.83%,end
what do you think
people will begin to think?

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:02.779 line:85.83%,end
"Let's go knock down
those horrendous spies!"

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.530 line:85.83%,end
Something like that.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.656 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.325 line:85.83%,end
People will hate communists even more.

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.994 line:85.83%,end
That'll put the ruling party
at an advantage.

01:03:10.661 --> 01:03:11.746 line:85.83%,end
What will happen to us?

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:14.040 line:85.83%,end
The more likely
the ruling party is to win the election,

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:16.459 line:85.83%,end
the less likely we're to live.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.296 line:85.83%,end
Now,

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.425 line:85.83%,end
how should we look when we're filmed then?

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.345 line:85.83%,end
Do you see what I'm trying to say?

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.180 line:85.83%,end
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.354 line:85.83%,end
<i>There are cameras from TV stations too.</i>

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:39.065 line:85.83%,end
So let's hang a banner
outside the windows of the lounge

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:42.151 line:85.83%,end
that says this is all a scheme
for the election.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:43.694 line:85.83%,end
Are you insane?

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.823 line:85.83%,end
Once we hang the banner,

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.992 line:85.83%,end
the North will think I've betrayed them.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:51.619 line:85.83%,end
Then my sister,

01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:55.456 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol and Joo's families
will all be put in danger.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:03:59.585 line:85.83%,end
Do you have any other ideas?

01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:06.551 line:85.83%,end
Duplicate the recording I gave you,
and send it out to the press.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.596 line:85.83%,end
Will it work? Our agents are stationed
at every newspaper and TV station.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.932 line:85.83%,end
We'll directly send them
to managing editors.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:16.102 line:85.83%,end
They won't stay quiet
if they see hard evidence, would they?

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.273 line:85.83%,end
Especially the TV station
that covered the abduction of Han I-seop.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:24.026 line:85.83%,end
Besides,

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:27.321 line:85.83%,end
I think that's the only way
to get Gal out.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.741 line:85.83%,end
Then let's try that first.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.372 line:85.83%,end
Then we should duplicate it first, right?

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:38.124 line:85.83%,end
I'll do it.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:58.227 line:85.83%,end
