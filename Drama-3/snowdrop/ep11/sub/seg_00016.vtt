<i>Someone in the dorm.</i>

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:28.868 line:85.83%,end

<i>What do you gain by turning against us?</i>

01:27:47.887 --> 01:27:49.097 line:14.17%,start
What do we do now?

What do you think?

<i>Should I pull the trigger?</i>

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.813 line:14.17%,start
You think I have anything to fear?
