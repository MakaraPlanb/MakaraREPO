<i>Did you forget about the agreement?</i>

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.823 line:85.83%,end
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.371 line:85.83%,end
He said they had agreed to killing us all.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.250 line:85.83%,end
They made a deal with the South
and agreed to killing their own agents.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.002 line:85.83%,end
Then what? Guaranteeing our safe return?

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.213 line:85.83%,end
We failed our mission,

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.424 line:85.83%,end
so we should've blown ourselves up anyway.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.425 line:85.83%,end
Mission?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.636 line:85.83%,end
Who was the mission for?

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.888 line:85.83%,end
What was it for?

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.058 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:09.478 line:85.83%,end
They ordered us to take down the Southern
government to achieve the revolution,

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:13.816 line:85.83%,end
then abandoned us
for that very government to regain power.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.777 line:85.83%,end
The liberation of our country.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.655 line:85.83%,end
The people's democratic revolution.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.241 line:85.83%,end
Have you forgotten?

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.121 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure it's for money,
not for the revolution.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:32.042 line:85.83%,end
For money, they sold their agents' lives
who have been loyal to the country

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.420 line:85.83%,end
to the South.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.255 line:85.83%,end
That is…

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.176 line:85.83%,end
what I can't forgive.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.353 line:85.83%,end
It's understandable
that you think that way

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.607 line:85.83%,end
and feel betrayed.

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.943 line:85.83%,end
But our families in the North…

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.322 line:85.83%,end
Our families who are praying

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:05.367 line:85.83%,end
that we accomplish our mission and
come back soon… If you think about them,

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.580 line:85.83%,end
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.711 line:85.83%,end
Think about your sister Su-hui.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.592 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is the necklace I cherish the most.</i>

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.345 line:85.83%,end
But I'm giving it to you.

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:29.183 line:85.83%,end
You…

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.728 line:85.83%,end
must come back to the North.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.582 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo and I

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.253 line:85.83%,end
won't tell the party
about the mistake you made today.

00:13:58.045 --> 00:13:59.505 line:85.83%,end
Right, Comrade Joo?

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:02.174 line:85.83%,end
I'll do as you say, Comrade Kang.

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:05.928 line:85.83%,end
So untie me now.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.097 line:85.83%,end
Let's find a way

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.767 line:85.83%,end
to save our families
as well as our agents.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.289 line:85.83%,end
Will there really be

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:19.418 line:85.83%,end
any way for us
to save our agents together?

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.254 line:85.83%,end
Check for yourself.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.725 line:85.83%,end
Go ahead and check
if the party still wants you…

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.979 line:85.83%,end
to save and send me back alive.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.577 line:85.83%,end
There are tangerines.

00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.871 line:85.83%,end
There are tangerines, Ms. Pi.

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:00.709 line:85.83%,end
Tangerines.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.754 line:85.83%,end
Let's have some first.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.017 line:85.83%,end
Let's bring the kids some too later.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.102 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro!

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:28.320 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.
