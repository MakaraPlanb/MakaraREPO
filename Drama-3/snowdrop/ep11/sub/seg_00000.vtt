EPISODE 11

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.370 line:85.83%,end
You were right.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.416 line:85.83%,end
I must get out of here alive.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.091 line:85.83%,end
And I can't let my guys die.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.136 line:85.83%,end
Let's find a way
for all of us to get out alive.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.194 line:85.83%,end
Let's say we've held down the other spies.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:37.448 line:85.83%,end
Do we stand a chance against the ANSP
dying for the government to regain power?

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.783 line:85.83%,end
We still got to try.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.578 line:85.83%,end
Or we'll all die just like they want.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.621 line:85.83%,end
I'm trying to save all the students too.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.299 line:85.83%,end
Hide here
until the other spies are held down.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.637 line:85.83%,end
Do not come upstairs.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.905 line:85.83%,end
See? I told you
they had lots of snacks in their rooms.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.034 line:85.83%,end
Have some.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.539 line:85.83%,end
We should bring
Comrades Lim and Kang some too.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.501 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry about that,
and just have some.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.762 line:85.83%,end
-That looks so good.
-What about us?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.271 line:85.83%,end
This is so good.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.610 line:85.83%,end
It's so good.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.153 line:85.83%,end
Dad!

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.823 line:85.83%,end
That goddamn b****.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.160 line:85.83%,end
Hey, can't you see him fainting?
He needs sugar!

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.370 line:85.83%,end
Shut up!

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.996 line:85.83%,end
How dare you raise your voice?

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:19.550 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness.
We might die any moment now.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.511 line:85.83%,end
Shouldn't you at least feed us?

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.430 line:85.83%,end
We're dying of hunger.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.021 line:85.83%,end
Shin Gyeong-ja.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.566 line:85.83%,end
Come here.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.492 line:85.83%,end
Bring this to him.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.379 line:85.83%,end
Our charismatic and thoughtful Bun-ok.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:02.135 line:85.83%,end
Could you please have mercy
and give us food too?
