01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:16.503 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang…

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:24.220 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no. She looks all haggard now.
Poor Dr. Kang.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:25.596 line:85.83%,end
Darn it…

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.380 line:85.83%,end
Follow them with the chicken.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.183 line:85.83%,end
These Southern guys…

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.852 line:85.83%,end
Their fried chicken is…

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:20.693 line:85.83%,end
Come here.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.629 line:85.83%,end
An influential spy like you

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.340 line:85.83%,end
must be confident
that the party will never abandon you.

01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:45.634 line:85.83%,end
Of course not.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.637 line:85.83%,end
I'll be abandoned eventually.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.190 line:85.83%,end
Defect to the South,
then the ANSP will protect you.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.609 line:85.83%,end
If you want,
they'll give you a new identity,

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:04.945 line:85.83%,end
and you can continue to be a doctor.

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:12.119 line:85.83%,end
For that to happen,
the opposition party must win.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:23.047 line:85.83%,end
If we can let people know this hostage
situation is a scheme for the election,

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.465 line:85.83%,end
we stand a chance.

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:27.551 line:85.83%,end
Besides, it's not a rigged election
anymore. People go vote themselves.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.470 line:85.83%,end
The transfer of power…

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:31.972 line:85.83%,end
It's possible.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.861 line:85.83%,end
All those revolutions

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:47.946 line:85.83%,end
and missions…

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.909 line:85.83%,end
Don't you want to live…

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.538 line:85.83%,end
freely without them?

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.222 line:85.83%,end
Can I have a cup of coffee?

01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:34.785 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing, Comrade Kang?

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.413 line:85.83%,end
Are you betraying our country too?

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:49.883 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang!

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.596 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang!

01:13:58.308 --> 01:13:59.351 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.691 line:85.83%,end
I know you won't change your mind easily.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.608 line:85.83%,end
Shut up.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.861 line:85.83%,end
I get that you like that wench.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.822 line:85.83%,end
But how could you choose her
over your family in the North?

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:16.285 line:85.83%,end
"Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:19.705 line:85.83%,end
So if you sense any change in
his ideology, kill him."

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.000 line:85.83%,end
I guess I was ordered so for a reason.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.089 line:85.83%,end
Who ordered to kill me?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:36.221 line:85.83%,end
Even if you get out of here alive,
you can't go back to the North.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.892 line:85.83%,end
And you won't be able to live freely
here with that wench either.

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:45.939 line:85.83%,end
Because our country will
hunt you down and kill you.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:53.947 line:85.83%,end
Answer my question.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.076 line:85.83%,end
Who ordered you?

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.165 line:85.83%,end
That doesn't matter.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:07.085 line:85.83%,end
You were a card to discard to begin with.
