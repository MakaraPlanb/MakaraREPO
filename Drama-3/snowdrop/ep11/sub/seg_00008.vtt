00:41:53.802 --> 00:41:55.262 line:85.83%,end
Gye Bun-ok, stop right there!

00:41:59.141 --> 00:42:01.352 line:85.83%,end
I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.605 line:85.83%,end
Is she crazy?

00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:08.359 line:85.83%,end
How could she be so rude to her?

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.522 line:85.83%,end
Pi, you little…

00:42:46.939 --> 00:42:48.816 line:85.83%,end
<i>You turned it off
without telling me last time.</i>

00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:51.151 line:85.83%,end
How is it in there?

00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:56.865 line:85.83%,end
Ah.

00:42:57.283 --> 00:43:01.287 line:85.83%,end
This is Gye Bun-ok,
the telephone operator of the dorm.

00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.498 line:85.83%,end
<i>Are you working for the ANSP?</i>

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.458 line:85.83%,end
Are you outside the dorm right now?

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.170 line:85.83%,end
Who are you? Where's Pi?

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:13.465 line:85.83%,end
Please! Please listen to me.

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:16.093 line:85.83%,end
<i>I have very important information.</i>

00:43:16.343 --> 00:43:18.887 line:85.83%,end
<i>So I contacted you in Ms. Pi's place.</i>

00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:23.642 line:85.83%,end
Important information? What is it?

00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.353 line:85.83%,end
I am really on the ANSP's side.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.982 line:85.83%,end
If anything happens to me,
you must help me, okay?

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:31.525 line:85.83%,end
<i>Okay?</i>

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:34.111 line:85.83%,end
All right. So what's the information?

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.240 line:85.83%,end
What happened is,

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:42.077 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho the spy
and the ANSP team leader--

00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:46.874 line:85.83%,end
Hello? Hey.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.376 line:85.83%,end
This little…

00:43:57.676 --> 00:43:58.802 line:85.83%,end
You…

00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:02.848 line:85.83%,end
How long have you been
in league with them?

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:08.395 line:85.83%,end
I haven't. This is the first time.

00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:10.856 line:85.83%,end
That radio belongs to Ms. Pi.

00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:13.817 line:85.83%,end
I just found it in the restroom.

00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:21.992 line:85.83%,end
Since we found out you helped the spies,
did you need some insurance?

00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:27.164 line:85.83%,end
If there were bullets in the gun,
you would've killed Ms. Pi.

00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:30.250 line:85.83%,end
What you did was horrible,
but you don't regret your actions at all.

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:34.380 line:85.83%,end
If Ms. Pi hadn't begged us to let you be,
we would've locked you in the basement.

00:44:34.963 --> 00:44:37.508 line:85.83%,end
Then you go about
doing something like this?

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.554 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi begged you to let me be?
She really did?

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.650 line:85.83%,end
Do you know how many crimes
you have committed?

00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:56.985 line:85.83%,end
Violating the National Security Law,

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.697 line:85.83%,end
threatening to kill,
illegal possession of firearms,

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:02.241 line:85.83%,end
and probably attempted murder too.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.788 line:85.83%,end
If you give the ANSP some information,
you think they'll let you off the hook?

00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:10.666 line:85.83%,end
Did you think catching a Northern spy

00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:13.377 line:85.83%,end
means a better performance review
and more incentives?

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.336 line:85.83%,end
I was…

00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:16.714 line:85.83%,end
forced.

00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:20.092 line:85.83%,end
I was forced to do it. That's all.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.596 line:85.83%,end
If you try anything stupid once more,

00:45:25.764 --> 00:45:27.558 line:85.83%,end
I'll consider you a Northern spy.

00:45:31.603 --> 00:45:32.563 line:85.83%,end
Go upstairs.

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.327 line:85.83%,end
<i>There's good news.</i>

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:51.999 line:85.83%,end
<i>Since the explosion and gunfight
this morning, it's been about ten hours.</i>

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:55.961 line:85.83%,end
<i>And it's been confirmed by the command
post that there were no casualties</i>

00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:57.296 line:85.83%,end
<i>from the explosion…</i>

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.093 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Choi.

00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:05.763 line:85.83%,end
Are there really no casualties?

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:07.264 line:85.83%,end
It's not a cover-up?

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.187 line:85.83%,end
How could no one have died
when bombs exploded?

00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:20.444 line:85.83%,end
I mean, that's such a relief.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.655 line:85.83%,end
You know my husband is trying his best

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:28.410 line:85.83%,end
to save every single hostage,
even on the day of Yeong-u's burial.

00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:30.537 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:33.749 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you try and convince him
to call it a day now?

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.543 line:85.83%,end
Okay. Thank you.

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.226 line:85.83%,end
