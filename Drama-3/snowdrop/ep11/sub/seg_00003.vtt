They told you to come up
since the spies are tied up.

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:40.457 line:85.83%,end
Really?

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.625 line:85.83%,end
This soon?

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:44.169 line:85.83%,end
Are you sure?

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:51.885 line:85.83%,end
If you don't believe me,
you can just stay here.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.264 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.348 line:85.83%,end
Lead the way.

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.728 line:85.83%,end
Let's go together.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:02.855 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.901 line:85.83%,end
I thought you'd never talk to me again.

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:12.072 line:85.83%,end
Are you not mad at me anymore?

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.702 line:85.83%,end
Forget about it. Come on now.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.998 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.419 line:85.83%,end
Girls?

00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.306 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Director.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.071 line:85.83%,end
REPORT MESSAGE

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.739 line:85.83%,end
SENDER: MORAN HILL 1

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:56.784 line:14.17%,start
IS THE ORDER TO SEND
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BACK ALIVE STILL VALID?

00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:37.950 line:85.83%,end
"Eliminate Taedong River 1."

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:01.932 line:85.83%,end
Where are we going?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.017 line:85.83%,end
Wellâ€¦

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.521 line:85.83%,end
I think they're gathered there.
Let's go that way.

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:11.984 line:85.83%,end
I should've just killed you
when you looked suspicious.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.153 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.324 line:85.83%,end
How could you think that way
when ordered to kill your comrade-in-arms?

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:20.617 line:85.83%,end
Comrade?

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:26.456 line:85.83%,end
He's a goddamn traitor.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.667 line:85.83%,end
He's not my comrade!

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:32.254 line:85.83%,end
You're a piece of s***
who betrayed your country.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.007 line:85.83%,end
That voiceâ€¦

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.302 line:85.83%,end
I guess he's being held in the hall
director's office. Want to go check?

00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:39.636 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure Soo-ho's there too.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.932 line:85.83%,end
No. Bun-ok, let's just go back downstairs.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.441 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok?

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.526 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.071 line:85.83%,end
Go to the office quietly.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.367 line:85.83%,end
"Follow no orders but the direct ones."

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:06.788 line:85.83%,end
They're telling you to kill me
even if other departmentsâ€¦

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.667 line:85.83%,end
order you to save me.

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.427 line:85.83%,end
Where do you belong, Comrade Kang?

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:23.430 line:85.83%,end
The election scheme is the UFD's doing.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.935 line:85.83%,end
Is this also Director Lim Ji-rok's order?

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:06.390 line:85.83%,end
Untie the doctor and Gyeok-chan right now.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.060 line:85.83%,end
What do you think--

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.396 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you hear me?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.569 line:85.83%,end
Don't move.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.116 line:85.83%,end
Take one more step forward,

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.827 line:85.83%,end
and I'll shoot.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.079 line:85.83%,end
Hand the gun over.
