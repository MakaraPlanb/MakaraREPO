00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:16.924 line:85.83%,end
I understand, sir.

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:20.010 line:85.83%,end
<i>I call it</i>

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.013 line:85.83%,end
<i>"Operation One-shot-two-kills."</i>

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:27.309 line:85.83%,end
<i>Saving your daughter and getting them
at the same time. What do you think?</i>

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.102 line:85.83%,end
Isn't it a good plan?

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:32.064 line:85.83%,end
Are you insane? They'll blow themselves up
if we fool them again.

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:33.023 line:85.83%,end
But what?

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.276 line:85.83%,end
I can't believe this.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.737 line:85.83%,end
My, this is so frustrating.

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:42.324 line:85.83%,end
Teaching at the Military Academy
suits you better.

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:44.201 line:85.83%,end
Why are you even the ANSP director?

00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:54.628 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.135 line:85.83%,end
Are you all right?

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:09.518 line:85.83%,end
Let go of him!

00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.815 line:85.83%,end
A gun in the medical kit.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:17.734 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team breaking in
via an emergency exit.

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.112 line:85.83%,end
Are you all right, Mr. Lee?

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.030 line:85.83%,end
Are you okay?

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.126 line:85.83%,end
How could you make him suffer like that?

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:36.336 line:85.83%,end
He's your hostage.
Is this really necessary?

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.588 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you people kill Geum-cheol?

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:42.718 line:85.83%,end
No, we didn't.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:47.306 line:85.83%,end
He took cyanide and dropped dead
according to that stupid manual of yours.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:54.980 line:85.83%,end
Drop dead?

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:59.443 line:85.83%,end
Don't speak ill of our late comrade.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:03.363 line:85.83%,end
Do you understand?

00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:07.743 line:85.83%,end
You idiot!

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.331 line:85.83%,end
Didn't I tell you
to always keep your temper?

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:15.375 line:85.83%,end
Are you stupid? You're not even armed.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.020 line:85.83%,end
Don't cross the line.

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.611 line:85.83%,end
If you want to maintain our mutual trust.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:48.533 line:85.83%,end
Should I see his wound?

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:04.299 line:85.83%,end
You follow me.

00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.762 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll release some of the hostages.</i>

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.445 line:85.83%,end
Don't shoot!

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:31.910 line:85.83%,end
You can come out.

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:34.830 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.540 line:85.83%,end
Go.

00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:38.083 line:85.83%,end
It's okay. Don't worry.

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.462 line:85.83%,end
Let's go!

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.221 line:85.83%,end
-The hostages are coming out. Move!
-Help them to safety!

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:55.183 line:85.83%,end
Go, go.

00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.060 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:02.774 line:85.83%,end
Stop.

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:06.027 line:85.83%,end
Get them into the ambulance
and the rest into the van.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.112 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:09.698 line:85.83%,end
Move it!

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:14.411 line:85.83%,end
-Hey, leave right away.
-Yes, sir.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:16.997 line:85.83%,end
-Get them in now.
-Yes, sir.

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:22.419 line:85.83%,end
They're all being moved.

00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:25.046 line:85.83%,end
Make sure they all keep their mouths shut.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.381 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:44.357 line:85.83%,end
Well, I sent five injured students

00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:46.234 line:85.83%,end
to the ANSP-designated hospital.

00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:49.196 line:85.83%,end
And as for the remaining four,

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:52.073 line:85.83%,end
I sent them to our agency for questioning.

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:53.867 line:85.83%,end
-Salute!
-Salute!

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.957 line:85.83%,end
Thank you for your hard work.

00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.918 line:85.83%,end
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:04.794 line:85.83%,end
What a surprise.

00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:08.590 line:85.83%,end
You guys must not have had anything to eat
since last night.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.219 line:85.83%,end
Hello, Mr. Nam.
