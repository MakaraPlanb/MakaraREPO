EPISODE 7

3
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,913
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,084
You leave.

5
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,003
This is our dorm.

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,090
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

7
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,927
Oh, my goodness.

8
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,678
Keep your heads down!

9
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,105
You…

10
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,942
You don't know who I am, do you?

11
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,280
Why can't I hear them?

12
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,450
I think she's speaking too quietly.

13
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,493
Turn the volume up then!

14
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:09,953
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,676
I'll tell you.

16
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:32,642
I'm…

17
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,230
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

18
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,574
If you don't believe me,
go check with them.

19
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,706
Eun Chang-su,

20
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,625
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

21
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:01,588
is my father.

22
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,174
-I can't hear her. What's she saying?
-Why is she whispering?

23
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,091
I don't know.

24
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:34,954
Let them go.

25
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:37,457
Let them all go!

26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,459
It's working again.

27
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,351
<i>You will never…</i>

28
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,939
<i>get a chance to be released again.</i>

29
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,510
Since she doesn't want to leave,

30
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,304
only nine will be released.

31
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,689
You evil bastard.

32
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:45,400
Release one more person
since I'm not leaving!

33
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,567
Who do you think you are?

34
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:48,778
To me, you are…

35
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:53,741
just…

36
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:58,746
a human shield.

37
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,047
Comrade Joo.

38
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:10,800
Have her stand by the windows.

39
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,138
Now!

40
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,481
Ms. Hall Director.

41
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,972
The daughter of the ANSP director
has been living in the dorm.

42
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,433
<i>That must've been bothering you.</i>

43
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,106
<i>Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?</i>

44
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,400
I heard the ANSP director is

45
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,153
one of the most
powerful people in the South.

46
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,822
And such a person's daughter
living in the dorm?

47
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,409
Did Yeong-ro tell you herself that she is

48
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:20,536
<i>the daughter of the ANSP director?</i>

49
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,664
<i>She was quiet about it</i>

50
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:25,458
even when she was
being kicked out of here.

51
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:27,752
Kicked out?

52
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,215
It was decided she leave the dorm
as a punishment for hiding you.

53
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,385
She hid him?

54
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,220
Hid the communist spy?

55
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,721
Your daughter really did it?

56
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,892
<i>She helped you because she believed
she was doing the right thing.</i>

57
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:48,314
<i>So he was willing to accept any punishment
without any regret or reflection.</i>

58
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,318
<i>But her courage and sacrifice ended up</i>

59
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,113
<i>putting everyone in the dorm in danger.</i>

60
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,160
So imagine
how Yeong-ro must be feeling right now.

61
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,996
If you can understand that
even just a little bit,

62
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:09,127
it's only right for you
to release as many hostages as possible.

63
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,213
That is…

64
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,051
the least you can do for her,

65
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,303
who saved you risking her life.

66
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:29,730
I think I made it very clear
that only nine hostages will be released.

67
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,566
You were her partner at the Open House.

68
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,985
I remember that you seemed quite nervous.

69
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:36,070
Was it all for show?

70
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,531
To take full advantage of Yeong-ro?

71
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:39,615
Let's go.

72
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,165
I need to go to

73
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,167
the bathroom first.

74
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,435
RESTROOM

75
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,777
Eung-cheol doesn't look good.

76
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,404
Can we

77
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:19,780
trust that doctor?

78
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,827
The hall director's in the restroom.
Bring her when she's done.

79
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,816
What are you doing? Hurry up.

80
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,320
Just give me a second.

81
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,430
I can see the students are safe.

82
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,640
Now I need to see
if my team leader is okay.

83
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,017
Where's he now?

84
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,686
Not now.

85
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,274
He can't have surgery
until his fever breaks anyway.

86
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:24,697
I mean, the doctor's doing nothing, so how
about my team leader get surgery first?

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,084
He has a gunshot wound.

88
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,170
He needs surgery as soon as possible.

89
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,505
-What's wrong with treating him while--
-Hey!

90
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,216
Are you kidding?

91
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,469
He shot at me,
and you want us to let him get treated?

92
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:51,891
Keep your word.

93
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,810
You promised to release hostages,
let me check the students' safety,

94
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,438
and let the doctor do surgery
on my team leader.

95
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,067
I brought Dr. Kang here
because you agreed on those terms.

96
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,823
You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?

97
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,745
I'll kill you first if anything goes
wrong, so don't mess with me.

98
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,801
How is he?

99
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,638
His temperature's still 38°C,
and it's not going down.

100
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:00,418
It's because the infection caused
a high white blood cell count.

101
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,587
I gave him a fever reducer,
so it'll go down in two to three hours.

102
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,513
<i>SWAT team breaking in soon.</i>

103
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,348
<i>The whole dorm is being wiretapped.</i>

104
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,779
Then why don't you treat
their team leader until then?

105
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:31,073
I think that's better as well.

106
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,875
The ANSP team leader
will be treated first.

107
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,501
Comrade.

108
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,425
Treat him? We should be killing him.

109
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:55,639
For now, it's most important
to maintain mutual trust.

110
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,185
<i>Trust?</i>

111
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,271
Their goal is killing us.
How can we trust them?

112
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,110
Just keep an eye on the hostages.
That's your job.

113
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,323
Especially those by the windows.

114
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,249
Didn't you say
there was no problem with her?

115
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,628
Yes, according to
all those weekly reports!

116
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,547
That damn Pi.

117
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,841
She even went through
water and electric torture.

118
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,718
How dare she stab me in the back?

119
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:35,364
My goodness.

120
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,491
I got to say,

121
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,743
you are indeed a liability.

122
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,037
A liability to us.

123
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,624
Even your child
has become a liability now.

124
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,459
Unbelievable.

125
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,086
Oh, right.

126
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,880
-Hey, An.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:55,467
Does hiding a communist spy
count as espionage?

128
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:59,972
To be precise,
it's aiding and abetting espionage.

129
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,807
My God.

130
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:03,058
The ANSP director

131
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,895
should be in the vanguard
of anti-communism and counterespionage.

132
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,980
You're a disgrace to our country.

133
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,773
Don't you think?

134
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,406
I was just kidding.

135
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,414
<i>By the way, ma'am,</i>

136
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,709
I know he said
it should be 13 young virgins,

137
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,836
but does it have to be exactly 13?

138
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,634
As a matter of fact,

139
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:40,304
I was dying to know about that all night,

140
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:44,058
so I called the fortuneteller
first thing in the morning.

141
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,314
What did he say?

142
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,609
He said it should be

143
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,277
exactly 13 virgins.

144
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,404
No more, no less.

145
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,198
Exactly 13.

146
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,493
Then it's very unlikely.

147
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,164
I mean, how will the spies kill

148
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:10,292
exactly 13 as if they know about it?

149
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:14,129
There are more than 70 hostages
in the dorm.

150
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,756
My goodness.

151
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,549
That many?

152
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,592
Yes.

153
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:19,760
That reminds me.

154
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,638
They're supposed to release
some of the hostages today.

155
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,724
Release?

156
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,102
How many?

157
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,939
Well, as many as the spies want, I guess.

158
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,734
Yes, I guess so.

159
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:30,122
What kind of man is
Eun Chang-su, the ANSP director?

160
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,047
Do you want me

161
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,507
to brief you on my boss?

162
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,384
<i>Brief a Northern spy?</i>

163
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,512
<i>I'm holding tens of students hostage,</i>

164
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,306
<i>yet he's fooled me twice.</i>

165
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,683
Is he foolish enough
to try to fool me again?

166
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,686
<i>Was Cheong-ya caught?</i>

167
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:54,938
<i>Was Han-na caught?</i>

168
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:57,149
<i>The ANSP director is
dealing with you himself?</i>

169
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,693
<i>A mere Northern spy like you?</i>

170
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,612
The director himself?

171
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,322
His daughter is being held hostage,

172
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,992
so I'm sure he ran over in a rush.

173
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,328
<i>The director's daughter?</i>

174
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:21,757
The whole building is
rigged with C4 bombs,

175
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,759
from basement two to the third floor.

176
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,054
<i>If you try to deceive me again,</i>

177
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,473
<i>the bombs will go off all at once.</i>

178
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,643
Check if it's true.

179
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:35,979
If I push this button,

180
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,023
you, I,

181
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,526
and the 70 hostages

182
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,403
will all die.

183
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,864
Then

184
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,033
Director Eun Chang-su

185
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,286
<i>won't even find his daughter's body.</i>

186
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:55,916
How dare that bastard
threaten him like that?

187
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:00,045
Wait, Eun.

188
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:02,464
Don't tell me you believe that bulls***.

189
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,632
I should.

190
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,884
If the bombs explode
and the students get killed,

191
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:06,927
what will you do?

192
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,638
<i>You'll blow yourself and your men up?</i>

193
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,017
Aren't you their leader?

194
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:16,311
Is Geum-cheol's death not enough?

195
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,313
Are you going
to lead the rest to death too?

196
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:23,026
I'll do anything for my men's honor.

197
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,613
I won't let them die as traitors.

198
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,200
I'd rather blow ourselves up

199
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,953
to die heroes for my country.

200
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:43,672
What is this?

201
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,465
Don't tell me

202
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,218
what he just said is scaring you.

203
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,095
My goodness.

204
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,766
You're too chicken to serve the country.

205
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,685
We can just get them all at once

206
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,146
before they blow themselves up.

207
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,690
Get them all at once? How?

208
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,986
I knew this might happen,
so I already put another plan into action.

209
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:13,827
Dr. Kang will knock out two
of the communist spies with injections,

210
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,329
so all you need to do

211
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:18,081
is get rid of the booby traps
on basement two.

212
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:22,169
Then our SWAT team
will go in secretly and kill

213
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,713
the last one.

214
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:26,924
I understand, sir.

215
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:30,010
<i>I call it</i>

216
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,013
<i>"Operation One-shot-two-kills."</i>

217
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:37,309
<i>Saving your daughter and getting them
at the same time. What do you think?</i>

218
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:39,102
Isn't it a good plan?

219
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:42,064
Are you insane? They'll blow themselves up
if we fool them again.

220
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,023
But what?

221
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,276
I can't believe this.

222
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,737
My, this is so frustrating.

223
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,324
Teaching at the Military Academy
suits you better.

224
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,201
Why are you even the ANSP director?

225
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:04,628
Mr. Lee.

226
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,135
Are you all right?

227
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:19,518
Let go of him!

228
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,815
A gun in the medical kit.

229
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,734
SWAT team breaking in
via an emergency exit.

230
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,112
Are you all right, Mr. Lee?

231
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,030
Are you okay?

232
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,126
How could you make him suffer like that?

233
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,336
He's your hostage.
Is this really necessary?

234
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,588
Didn't you people kill Geum-cheol?

235
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,718
No, we didn't.

236
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:57,306
He took cyanide and dropped dead
according to that stupid manual of yours.

237
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:04,980
Drop dead?

238
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:09,443
Don't speak ill of our late comrade.

239
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,363
Do you understand?

240
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,743
You idiot!

241
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:22,331
Didn't I tell you
to always keep your temper?

242
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,375
Are you stupid? You're not even armed.

243
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,020
Don't cross the line.

244
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,611
If you want to maintain our mutual trust.

245
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:58,533
Should I see his wound?

246
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:14,299
You follow me.

247
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,762
<i>I'll release some of the hostages.</i>

248
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,445
Don't shoot!

249
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:41,910
You can come out.

250
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,830
It's all right.

251
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,540
Go.

252
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,083
It's okay. Don't worry.

253
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,462
Let's go!

254
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:01,221
-The hostages are coming out. Move!
-Help them to safety!

255
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,183
Go, go.

256
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,060
Hurry up!

257
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:12,774
Stop.

258
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,027
Get them into the ambulance
and the rest into the van.

259
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,112
Yes, sir.

260
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,698
Move it!

261
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:24,411
-Hey, leave right away.
-Yes, sir.

262
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:26,997
-Get them in now.
-Yes, sir.

263
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,419
They're all being moved.

264
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,046
Make sure they all keep their mouths shut.

265
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,381
Yes, sir.

266
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,357
Well, I sent five injured students

267
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:56,234
to the ANSP-designated hospital.

268
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,196
And as for the remaining four,

269
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,073
I sent them to our agency for questioning.

270
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:03,867
-Salute!
-Salute!

271
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,957
Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:12,918
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

273
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,794
What a surprise.

274
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:18,590
You guys must not have had anything to eat
since last night.

275
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,219
Hello, Mr. Nam.

276
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,640
Honey.

277
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,480
We were starving, actually.

278
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:37,567
Oh, my, ma'am. It doesn't look like food.

279
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,695
It looks like artwork.
It's too pretty to eat.

280
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:46,451
I must say,

281
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:50,080
you sure are full of surprises.

282
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:53,500
You have such a considerate wife.
You're so lucky.

283
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,838
All right. Let's dig in.

284
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:02,133
In any case, some of the hostages
have been released.

285
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,094
Let's eat and get back
to fighting those spies.

286
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,638
All right, guys. Let's dig in!

287
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,640
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

288
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,225
Thank you, ma'am.

289
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,230
Come eat.

290
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,031
-What is it?
-You should see the news.

291
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,621
<i>Controversy arose over Professor Han</i>

292
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,456
-What?
<i>-who was found dead on a Northern</i>

293
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,499
<i>-spy boat.</i>
-It's Gal.

294
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:39,045
<i>There was a suspicion that the economics
professor tried to defect to the North,</i>

295
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,715
<i>but decisive evidence has been revealed</i>

296
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,925
<i>that the North in fact
tried to abduct him.</i>

297
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,929
<i>According to the Catholic Priests
Association for Justice,</i>

298
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,725
<i>Priest Kim Hyeon-seung received
a tape recording from Han I-seop,</i>

299
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:55,395
<i>and the tape contains the voice of the spy</i>

300
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:58,273
<i>who tried to abduct him on November 27.</i>

301
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,942
What did you just say?

302
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,571
Where did you say my son is?
He's studying in the US.

303
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,575
Your son isn't in Boston.
He's in Pyongyang.

304
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:10,744
In Pyongyang?

305
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,621
Who are you?

306
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,205
Who are you people?

307
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,583
Did you kidnap my son?

308
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,502
If you want to save him,
come with us to Pyongyang.

309
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,587
Stop the car!

310
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,880
Stop the car!

311
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:25,133
Stop the car! Now--

312
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:30,180
<i>Saying it was likely to be
the spies' second attempt to abduct him,</i>

313
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:33,224
<i>the CPAJ denied the rumor
about him defecting to the North.</i>

314
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:37,395
<i>And the opposition party is claiming that
the current administration is behind it,</i>

315
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,689
<i>so it's expected to have a huge impact.</i>

316
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,360
<i>Reporting from Yeyeon Cathedral,
I'm Gal Sang-sik, JBC.</i>

317
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,664
You son of a b****!

318
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:57,582
Why me, sir?

319
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,460
I'll fix it.

320
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,712
What do you mean, fix it?

321
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:03,797
It's in the news!

322
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,507
How will you fix it?

323
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,550
You bastard. It's hot! Stop right there!

324
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,429
-First, I'll sue them for defaming ANSP.
-Come here. Why you…

325
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:13,973
-Come here, you bastard.
-And, sir,

326
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:17,769
I'll issue summonses against
the CPAJ and that bastard Gal Sang-sik.

327
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:19,938
-What? You idiot!
-Stop the nonsense and get out!

328
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,443
-Well…
-Everyone, out.

329
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:26,569
Hey.

330
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:28,822
-You should go home.
-Okay.

331
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,031
Get out.

332
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,785
Where are you going, you idiots?
Come back here!

333
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:35,995
Hey.

334
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:37,747
Are you crazy?

335
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,666
Why did you tell them to leave?

336
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:44,003
We must press charges, make up evidence
that he was defecting, and make it public!

337
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,756
Hey!

338
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:50,301
Did you find anything useful in Han's bag?

339
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:54,472
Well, we found a letter
from his son in Pyongyang--

340
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,684
Why have you still not used it?
Make it public now!

341
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,310
Fabricate evidence if necessary!

342
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:00,353
Shut up!

343
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:03,815
What?

344
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:07,819
"Shut up"?

345
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:09,779
Fabricate evidence?

346
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:13,408
We've given the press guidelines
every morning trying to shut them up,

347
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,492
but it didn't work!

348
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:19,289
They have hard evidence. You think you can
cover it up with fabricated evidence?

349
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:20,749
Then what?

350
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,876
We just let the opposition party
have their way?

351
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,587
Our candidate will lose the election
for sure at this rate.

352
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:32,594
Pick it up.

353
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:39,559
Eun Chang-su speaking.

354
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,564
It seems plan B also failed.

355
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:50,195
I'm sorry, sir.

356
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:51,446
I'll find the--

357
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,949
Come in by five with a solution.

358
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,244
Yes, sir.

359
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,632
-What did he say?
-To come in by five.

360
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,425
What? What do we do?

361
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:15,720
This is bad. We'll catch hell
if we go without a solution.

362
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,139
Wait, Eun!

363
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,016
-Wait.
-Then we should…

364
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,354
come up with a solution.

365
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,567
We should let the press know

366
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,486
about the hostage situation in the dorm.

367
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,947
Are you crazy? Yeong-ro is in there.

368
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,159
If we also reveal the fact that
they have the ANSP director's daughter,

369
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,453
I doubt they'll hurt our Yeong-ro.

370
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,540
But they already know she's my daughter.

371
00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:45,875
They're still willing
to die with the hostages.

372
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:49,879
If they find out we've told the press,
they might blow themselves up.

373
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:52,465
Then we should

374
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,636
make the North order them
not to blow themselves up.

375
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,806
That's impossible.
They want us to send them back unscathed.

376
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:02,600
We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.

377
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:05,103
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars

378
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,814
just to save those expendable spies?

379
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,862
The presidential election is in ten days.

380
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,072
You can take care of this
after the election's won.

381
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,782
If we make this drag on

382
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,869
and be in the news every day
up until the election,

383
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,872
nobody will pay attention
to Han I-seop's case.

384
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,290
Definitely.

385
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:29,210
Hoping to fight against the Northern spies
holding the girls hostage,

386
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:32,797
I'm sure people will vote
for candidate Park Mu-yeol.

387
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,257
Exactly.

388
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,682
I'll talk to Lim Ji-rok then.

389
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,269
Withdraw the SWAT team right away.

390
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,104
I'll take care of that.

391
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:51,232
So you go do your job.
Hurry up. We have no time to lose.

392
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,902
Hey! Get me the radio!

393
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:56,821
SWAT team, stand by. Don't do anything!

394
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:00,366
<i>Anyone move a finger,
and I'll kill that bastard myself!</i>

395
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,915
Get dressings ready.

396
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,291
Okay.

397
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,711
Give me the gun.

398
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,339
Now.

399
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:17,860
This is bad.

400
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,321
I totally forgot about it.

401
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,074
I'm supposed to meet Antonio
at Rome Coffee Shop at five.

402
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,827
What if he thinks I stood him up?

403
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,620
Are you serious right now?

404
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,163
Antonio?

405
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,543
What about your lovers here?

406
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,672
Are you seriously worried about that now?

407
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,133
I guess you haven't heard yet.

408
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:42,969
She and Gwang-tae are through.

409
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:47,056
And she's started seeing Antonio
this month. To learn Italian.

410
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,518
Oh, no.

411
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,311
The criminal law final is tomorrow.

412
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,188
They must know
we're being held here, right?

413
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,690
They won't hold the exam, right?

414
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,365
Did she just laugh? Hey.

415
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,367
What's so funny?

416
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,454
You leech living off the tuition we pay.

417
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:11,122
What?

418
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,124
"Leech living off the tuition we pay"?

419
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,043
What? Am I wrong?

420
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,669
That's what you are.

421
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:17,587
Don't you agree?

422
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,921
Hey, Polka Dot.

423
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,466
Shut your trap.

424
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,190
You confidently promised to get
300 million dollars from them in ten days.

425
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,153
Rescuing your son
as well as getting 300 million dollars…

426
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,239
Will that be really possible?

427
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,960
<i>Despite knowing it's impossible,</i>

428
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:00,463
<i>he's trying to buy time.</i>

429
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:04,092
<i>The almighty Lim Ji-rok is also</i>

430
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,677
<i>just another father who loves his child.</i>

431
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:30,118
Lim Ji-rok speaking.

432
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:31,702
Mr. Lim.

433
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,581
I'm sorry about last time. I apologize.

434
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:37,166
It was so urgent that--

435
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,085
<i>When on earth are you going to send</i>

436
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:41,379
our agents in the dorm back to us?

437
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,882
It's been exposed that Han was abducted

438
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,176
and not defecting to the North.

439
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,138
So Aemin Party is
in a tough spot right now.

440
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,181
That's your problem.

441
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:55,518
Send our agents
back to the North right away!

442
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,270
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

443
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:59,272
but we have no choice but to make

444
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,190
the hostage situation public.

445
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:02,775
<i>What?</i>

446
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:04,443
The hostage situation?

447
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:12,326
What on earth is your big plan
you want to carry out?

448
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,163
As for the spies, how about we kill

449
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,165
all three?

450
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,416
Kill all three?

451
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,586
Are you seriously
thinking of killing them all?

452
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,463
Sir, it's just three spies.
If you sacrifice them,

453
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,507
you'll get 300 million dollars.

454
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,926
Just three spies?

455
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,221
<i>Send our agents back to us unscathed!</i>

456
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:34,724
Send them back right away! If you don't,

457
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:36,767
there will be war! You hear me?

458
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:39,812
Sir.

459
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,238
Yeon-hwa!

460
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,951
Send them a message

461
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:56,370
that they must come back alive! Now!

462
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,039
Yes, sir.

463
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:58,998
Anyway,

464
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,418
the Secretary's Office wants
to see you right now.

465
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:04,837
Right now?

466
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:24,232
Mr. Lim?

467
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:28,611
This is Choi Su-ryeon,
the deputy director of MSS.

468
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:30,780
I see.

469
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:33,074
You'll have to negotiate with me
from now on.

470
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,410
<i>I'm sure</i>

471
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,288
our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.

472
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,292
Kill them.

473
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,537
Comrade Choi Su-ryeon just told
the South to kill all of our spies.

474
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,142
STOP
SECURITY CHECKPOINT

475
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,814
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

476
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,024
What's going on?

477
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,239
You did well.

478
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,538
Could you put the rifle away?

479
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,874
Don't you know
about the Geneva Conventions?

480
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,003
Even during war, you can't attack any
of your enemy's medical staff or hospitals

481
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,713
that wounded soldiers are in.

482
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:22,350
What did you do to him?
Why isn't he waking up?

483
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:25,102
Midazolam is

484
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,689
a sedative you use before surgery.

485
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,610
Hold on.

486
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,912
Stand up.

487
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:11,107
Look. How could you suspect the doctor?

488
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,193
If they wanted to kill you,
they wouldn't have sent in a doctor,

489
00:39:14,276 --> 00:39:15,694
but an armed agent.

490
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,428
Calm down. She's just a doctor!

491
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:24,013
Stop!

492
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,446
What's going on?

493
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:42,072
Why is there music playing?

494
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:43,824
Why? Fix it! Now!

495
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,451
Fix it! Hurry up!

496
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:49,330
Why is there music playing? Fix it!

497
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,249
Fix it, you bastards!

498
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:10,809
I didn't know. I swear!
I didn't know about it.

499
00:41:11,393 --> 00:41:12,770
Comrade.

500
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,563
I found a pistol in her bag.

501
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:15,898
A pistol!

502
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,239
You found it, so let it go.

503
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,796
They've deceived us three times,
but what? "Let it go"?

504
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:42,132
They're looking down on us
because you're so soft!

505
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,791
What the hell are you doing?

506
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,227
It's an emergency.

507
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:36,604
<i>The doctor's in danger.</i>

508
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,689
<i>It's an emergency. The doctor's in danger.</i>

509
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,775
Which sniper was that?

510
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,569
-Which one?
-It was number 14.

511
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:46,322
-Go find out where it is. Now!
-Stand by!

512
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:56,290
It's the back side of Mount Ogong.

513
00:42:58,792 --> 00:42:59,877
Stand by!

514
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,847
You've deceived us three times!

515
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,351
You're forcing us to kill her!

516
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:18,604
Come here!

517
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:20,773
Don't shoot!

518
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:22,107
<i>Please don't!</i>

519
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:23,901
Don't shoot!

520
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,570
Sniper… Sniper!

521
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:29,531
Hey, kill that communist bastard
right now!

522
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:30,449
Now!

523
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:32,117
But the doctor's in the way.

524
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:36,747
That little… That piece of…

525
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,458
How dare those bastards try to harm my…

526
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,794
F***!

527
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:44,254
You have to save her!

528
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,798
-At all costs!
-Yes, sir.

529
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:47,466
-You bastards.
-I'm sorry, sir.

530
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:50,719
If you fail to save Dr. Kang,
I'll kill all of you.

531
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:53,639
-Save her! At all cost! Understand?
-It's dangerous.

532
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:55,641
You bastard!

533
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:58,644
Cheong-ya…

534
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,443
Are you insane?

535
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,529
We need her to save Eung-cheol!

536
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,157
Let go of me. We need
to teach them a lesson right now.

537
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,368
Comrade Joo!

538
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,416
Ma'am, please do something.

539
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,502
Come! Now!

540
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:25,045
Come here!

541
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:29,007
I'll kill her!

542
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:34,888
Let go!

543
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:40,894
Hey.

544
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,528
Let go.

545
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:51,071
Let go!

546
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,698
Gyeok-chan.

547
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:54,700
Calm down.

548
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:56,410
Please.

549
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:09,715
Hey.

550
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:36,158
Stay away!

551
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,835
Put it down.

552
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:53,133
Oh, no. Yeong-ro's in danger.

553
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:55,469
-This is bad.
-Hey.

554
00:45:58,096 --> 00:45:59,932
Put the gun down. Now.

555
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:01,767
Or you'll get hurt.

556
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:10,400
Let the doctor go. Now!

557
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:11,401
Do you want to die?

558
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,198
Your teammate…

559
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,326
No! Easy, easy.

560
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,625
Your teammate

561
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,419
hasn't been treated yet.

562
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,880
He'll die if he doesn't get treated.

563
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,007
For sure.

564
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,595
Comrade Joo.

565
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:43,600
If you kill the doctor, they'll never

566
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,144
send in another doctor.

567
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:50,357
You've been fooled three times.

568
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,527
Shouldn't you take advantage
of this chance?

569
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,699
They have no choice but to do what you ask
because you might blow yourselves up.

570
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:01,201
Oh, right.

571
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,537
To get out of here safely,

572
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:06,874
you also need
a means of transportation. Right?

573
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:19,761
Comrade Joo.

574
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:23,390
Lower the gun.

575
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:28,687
Now!

576
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,742
Those damn bastards!

577
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:45,537
I'll kill you all!

578
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:49,082
Hey! Don't fire back!

579
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,584
Everyone get down!

580
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,419
Hold fire! Don't fire back!

581
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,178
Come on!

582
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,788
Stop wasting the bullets.

583
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,788
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

584
00:49:15,377 --> 00:49:19,715
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

585
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:54,374
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

586
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:13,054
Take your hands off the door.

587
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:16,474
The SWAT team is standing by outside.

588
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,312
Take your hands off it
if you want to live.

589
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:35,785
Even if you shoot me, they'll break in
since I disabled the booby trap.

590
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,041
You know what this is, right?

591
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:50,133
If I push this button, you and I,
as well as the hostages, will all die.

592
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,599
You want to save your team leader,

593
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,185
don't you?

594
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:04,648
He even got shot to protect you.

595
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,864
If you want to save him,

596
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,367
go out and stop the SWAT team.

597
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:28,171
SWAT team, go in! Now!

598
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:29,631
SWAT team, go in!

599
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:34,135
SWAT team, go in!

600
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:44,896
SWAT team, go in! You bastards!

601
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,530
<i>Hey, are you sure
the wiretapping is working?</i>

602
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:55,865
Why can't I hear anything?
Turn the volume up!

603
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:57,033
Turn it up!

604
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:04,708
Turn it up, you idiots! God damn it!

605
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:09,296
Eun, how did it go?

606
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,630
Did you talk to them?

607
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,592
See? I told you.

608
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:20,432
In any case, I'm worried how much more
Lim Ji-rok will demand this time.

609
00:54:20,515 --> 00:54:22,017
He's not in charge anymore.

610
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,227
We negotiate with Choi Su-ryeon now.

611
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,438
What? Why?

612
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:29,232
What's going on?

613
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:31,776
Why are we not sending the SWAT team in?

614
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,029
We must send them in!

615
00:54:34,112 --> 00:54:35,196
How dare you--

616
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:40,869
It's me.

617
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:43,455
You said you'd send us
back to the North safely,

618
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:46,082
but you're sending the SWAT team in?

619
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,335
Sending the SWAT team in?

620
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,880
Hey! It's all a lie!
Our agent lied to you!

621
00:54:51,963 --> 00:54:54,341
She lied to make you surrender!

622
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,342
Give it!

623
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,762
<i>Listen. First, let Cheong-- No.</i>

624
00:54:58,845 --> 00:54:59,888
Let the doctor out.

625
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:03,099
Let Dr. Kang out right now, you bastard!

626
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:09,773
How did you find out your agent talked
about the SWAT team in the tent?

627
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:17,364
He wants to talk to you.

628
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:21,242
The hostages' lives are
at stake, but what?

629
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:23,119
It's all a lie?

630
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:24,788
Seriously?

631
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:26,956
All right.

632
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,416
Get her out of here!

633
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,960
Yes, sir. Come out here.

634
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,171
Hey, Choi.

635
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:35,090
Come here.

636
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:36,591
Let go of me!

637
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:45,433
There must've been

638
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:47,852
<i>a misunderstanding.
We didn't try to send them in.</i>

639
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:50,563
-We just wanted to send you back--
<i>-No.</i>

640
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:54,192
I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.

641
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,949
If you don't believe me,
check with the North.

642
00:56:01,032 --> 00:56:02,450
Check the instructions.

643
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:07,914
You tell me to check the instructions
whenever you're cornered.

644
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,544
Last time we followed the instructions,
we got shot at upon getting out.

645
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:16,005
That was because of the engagement
on the West Sea. I told you!

646
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:17,549
Does the leadership in the North

647
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:21,010
know that you tried to kill us?

648
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,515
They do know all three of you are alive.

649
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:31,104
Seeing how you know our rendezvous point

650
00:56:31,729 --> 00:56:34,441
and the goal of this mission well,

651
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,527
you must be in close liaison
with the leadership in the North.

652
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,783
What kind of deal did you make?

653
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,996
<i>You'd better be honest with me.</i>

654
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:52,167
Your daughter's in my hands.

655
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,544
You know that, right?

656
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,300
<i>You are</i>

657
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,928
a spy who must obey
orders from your country.

658
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:06,890
<i>So check the instructions right now!</i>

659
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:13,271
I wanted us to talk it out
before I make you pay for fooling us.

660
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:14,814
But it's not working.

661
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,941
Listen carefully.

662
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:20,862
I'll pick a hostage at random
and kill them in ten minutes.

663
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,780
What?

664
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:26,659
And that student's death
will be all on you.

665
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:29,621
Hello?

666
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:30,955
Hello?

667
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:33,041
Turn the volume up!

668
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,584
Turn it up!

669
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,045
"Student"? He definitely said student.

670
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,239
Are you really going to kill them?

671
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:09,619
I should.

672
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,955
Who do you think we should kill?

673
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,711
<i>The one who called us communist bastards…</i>

674
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:22,423
Shouldn't we kill that one first?

675
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:25,969
So you're saying
we should kill Eun Yeong-ro first, right?

676
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:33,226
Okay.

677
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:35,770
Kill her.

678
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,297
It's not working, is it?

679
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,381
Why can't I hear anything?

680
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:06,634
The wiretapping in Area 2-4 is cut off.

681
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,469
What?

682
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:16,060
Eun Yeong-ro's
the daughter of the ANSP director.

683
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,567
Which means she's our lifeline.

684
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,160
<i>-Area 2-4…</i>
-Area 2-2 is cut off.

685
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:33,828
<i>-Can any sniper see her?</i>
-What?

686
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:35,538
<i>I repeat. Area 2-4--</i>

687
00:59:47,425 --> 00:59:48,968
-Hey, An!
-Yes, sir.

688
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:50,428
One moment, sir.

689
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:52,013
Area 2-3 is not working as well!

690
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:52,930
Forget that.

691
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:55,266
Area 1-1 is not working as well!

692
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,935
Don't just say that!
Find the ones still working!

693
00:59:58,019 --> 00:59:59,312
Check if there's any working!

694
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,313
Hurry up.

695
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:05,985
What the hell are you doing?

696
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:29,634
Please.

697
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:34,472
Damn it.

698
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:41,646
Hey.

699
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,632
I got rid of all the bugs.

700
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:53,593
You can talk freely now.

701
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:55,970
What's going on?

702
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,236
<i>Lim Soo-ho?</i>

703
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:14,405
<i>This is the ANSP director.</i>

704
01:02:21,788 --> 01:02:23,539
Comrade Joo Gyeok-chan.

705
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,420
You were fearless and worthy of the Order
of Military Service Honor you got.

706
01:02:31,631 --> 01:02:36,219
I was instructed to come here
to send you back to the North safely.

707
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:39,972
I'm Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

708
01:02:42,183 --> 01:02:45,269
And I'm also known as Moran Hill 1
in our country.

709
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,565
Moran Hill…

710
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:53,986
The one awarded the Hero of the Republic?

711
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,285
I apologize. I should have recognized you.

712
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:04,205
I provoked you on purpose
to fool the others,

713
01:03:04,288 --> 01:03:05,248
so don't worry.

714
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:09,168
<i>Lim Soo-ho! Can you hear me?</i>

715
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,389
Lim Soo-ho. You and I may

716
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,309
believe in different things in different
situations, but we want the same thing.

717
01:03:25,393 --> 01:03:27,311
You want your men's safety,

718
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:28,479
and I want

719
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:31,274
the hostages' safety.

720
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:32,859
Now,

721
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,195
<i>the director of the Agency
for National Security Planning</i>

722
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,282
<i>desperately wants to talk with you.</i>

723
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:43,619
Pick up the phone!

724
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:45,371
You can hear me, right?

725
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,207
Let's talk it out! Please!

726
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,168
-Those bastards.
<i>-Lim Soo-ho!</i>

727
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:53,838
They wiretapped us, and what? Talk it out?

728
01:03:55,256 --> 01:03:56,382
They can hear me, right?

729
01:03:57,258 --> 01:04:00,469
Actually, the ANSP director told me
to check the party's instructions,

730
01:04:01,178 --> 01:04:03,764
so I took you here to check them with you.

731
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,529
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

732
01:04:19,447 --> 01:04:21,490
If you kill any of the students,

733
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:23,910
you'll be disobeying
orders from the North.

734
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:28,289
<i>We agreed to send you back to the North
safely in ten days, so check right now.</i>

735
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:31,500
You bastard! Check the instructions first!

736
01:04:35,463 --> 01:04:37,256
He hung up again!

737
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,799
Stop provoking him!

738
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,261
Hello?

739
01:04:43,137 --> 01:04:44,221
They're not answering?

740
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,516
Check them.

741
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:52,647
<i>It has been the basics review homework--</i>

742
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:16,212
"Reached an agreement with the South."

743
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:19,298
"Not to kill any hostages."

744
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,926
"Guaranteed to be sent back in ten days."

745
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,638
Will we really be able

746
01:05:27,014 --> 01:05:28,891
to go back alive in ten days?

747
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:35,982
Last time we were ordered
to cooperate with them, we almost died.

748
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,567
-So from my point of view--
-Your point of view?

749
01:05:43,197 --> 01:05:46,200
Since when did you start
questioning the instructions?

750
01:05:50,454 --> 01:05:51,539
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

751
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:57,169
The failure to abduct Professor Han
is all on you.

752
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,881
And because of you,
all of our agents on our ship

753
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:03,676
were killed.

754
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,140
Your new mission is to go back alive

755
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:11,392
after keeping the hostages for ten days.

756
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,187
Making a contribution
to make up for your failure

757
01:06:15,688 --> 01:06:17,648
is what you need to do from now on.

758
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,444
I understand.

759
01:06:32,663 --> 01:06:33,497
Look.

760
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:39,295
You should feed the students.

761
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,590
They haven't eaten for days.

762
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:44,008
She's right.

763
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:46,552
And Mr. Kim's blood sugar is too low.

764
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,140
Let's do that.

765
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:57,855
Well, then I should
go make some rice balls.

766
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,231
What ingredients do we have?

767
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,318
Sausages and some tofu…

768
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:05,988
I should fry them
and cook some <i>doenjang</i> soup as well.

769
01:07:20,961 --> 01:07:21,796
Go back.

770
01:08:01,794 --> 01:08:04,964
That's good. Yeong-ro's still alive.

771
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,757
They must've listened to the instructions.

772
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,218
Then should we let the press know, sir?

773
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:10,636
We should tell Code 1 first.

774
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,430
Let's hurry. You know
how impatient he is. Let's go.

775
01:08:36,453 --> 01:08:37,454
Hello?

776
01:08:38,455 --> 01:08:39,707
Yes. And?

777
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,918
What? What are you talking about?

778
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:45,838
Eun Yeong-u?

779
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:49,258
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

780
01:09:50,611 --> 01:09:51,570
Eat.

781
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:57,660
Aren't I just a human shield?

782
01:09:58,827 --> 01:09:59,828
So why?

783
01:10:03,374 --> 01:10:05,334
I'm not telling you to eat for your sake,

784
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:09,380
but for our sake.

785
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,011
Because the ANSP director's daughter
shouldn't starve to death?

786
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,143
That paper airplane…

787
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,231
Why do you have it?

788
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,533
Don't tell me

789
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:39,785
you came to the dorm

790
01:10:42,246 --> 01:10:44,707
because of that paper airplane.

791
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:59,179
<i>Hello. This is JBC breaking news.</i>

792
01:10:59,263 --> 01:11:03,434
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

793
01:11:03,517 --> 01:11:07,521
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

794
01:11:07,604 --> 01:11:11,483
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

795
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:14,820
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

796
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,031
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

797
01:11:17,114 --> 01:11:19,450
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

798
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,869
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

799
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:25,998
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

800
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:29,376
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

801
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:33,005
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

802
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,423
<i>and came to Korea</i>

803
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:37,468
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

804
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:41,388
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

805
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:44,224
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

806
01:11:59,823 --> 01:12:01,200
Cardiac arrest!

807
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,409
<i>Bring him back.</i>

808
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:05,120
Bring him back!

809
01:12:06,246 --> 01:12:08,082
<i>So the ANSP director's daughter</i>

810
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:10,709
hid you in this dorm?

811
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,254
<i>But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.</i>

812
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,297
The doctor?

813
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:17,466
I never had any personal feelings for her.

814
01:12:19,176 --> 01:12:21,178
We don't intend to hurt you.

815
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,807
<i>We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.</i>

816
01:12:27,059 --> 01:12:28,268
<i>So you must know</i>

817
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:32,106
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

818
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:34,650
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

819
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:35,901
<i>That's a bomb, isn't it?</i>

820
01:12:36,402 --> 01:12:39,113
Aren't they going to just kill us all?
Where's Yeong-ro?

821
01:12:39,696 --> 01:12:42,282
<i>Let me out.</i>

822
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:52,709
BONUS

823
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,424
The doctor who treated you

824
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,884
is comrade Kang Cheong-ya

825
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:03,637
also known as Moran Hill 1.

826
01:13:11,061 --> 01:13:12,020
Moran…

827
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:14,148
No. Don't get up.

828
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,317
Get better as soon as possible.

829
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:19,945
To go back alive in ten days.

830
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:22,239
Comrade.

831
01:13:22,573 --> 01:13:24,324
Am I dreaming right now?

832
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,535
Can you pinch me?
