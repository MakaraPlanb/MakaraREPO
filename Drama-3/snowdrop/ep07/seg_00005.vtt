00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:16.640 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.480 line:85.83%,end
We were starving, actually.

00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:27.567 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my, ma'am. It doesn't look like food.

00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:30.695 line:85.83%,end
It looks like artwork.
It's too pretty to eat.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.451 line:85.83%,end
I must say,

00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:40.080 line:85.83%,end
you sure are full of surprises.

00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:43.500 line:85.83%,end
You have such a considerate wife.
You're so lucky.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.838 line:85.83%,end
All right. Let's dig in.

00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:52.133 line:85.83%,end
In any case, some of the hostages
have been released.

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.094 line:85.83%,end
Let's eat and get back
to fighting those spies.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.638 line:85.83%,end
All right, guys. Let's dig in!

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.640 line:85.83%,end
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:00.225 line:85.83%,end
Thank you, ma'am.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.230 line:85.83%,end
Come eat.

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.031 line:85.83%,end
-What is it?
-You should see the news.

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:21.621 line:85.83%,end
<i>Controversy arose over Professor Han</i>

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:23.456 line:85.83%,end
-What?
<i>-who was found dead on a Northern</i>

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.499 line:85.83%,end
<i>-spy boat.</i>
-It's Gal.

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:29.045 line:85.83%,end
<i>There was a suspicion that the economics
professor tried to defect to the North,</i>

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.715 line:85.83%,end
<i>but decisive evidence has been revealed</i>

00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.925 line:85.83%,end
<i>that the North in fact
tried to abduct him.</i>

00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:37.929 line:85.83%,end
<i>According to the Catholic Priests
Association for Justice,</i>

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:41.725 line:85.83%,end
<i>Priest Kim Hyeon-seung received
a tape recording from Han I-seop,</i>

00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:45.395 line:85.83%,end
<i>and the tape contains the voice of the spy</i>

00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:48.273 line:85.83%,end
<i>who tried to abduct him on November 27.</i>

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:50.942 line:85.83%,end
What did you just say?

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.571 line:85.83%,end
Where did you say my son is?
He's studying in the US.

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:58.575 line:85.83%,end
Your son isn't in Boston.
He's in Pyongyang.

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:00.744 line:85.83%,end
In Pyongyang?

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:02.621 line:85.83%,end
Who are you?

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.205 line:85.83%,end
Who are you people?

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.583 line:85.83%,end
Did you kidnap my son?

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:09.502 line:85.83%,end
If you want to save him,
come with us to Pyongyang.

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.587 line:85.83%,end
Stop the car!

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.880 line:85.83%,end
Stop the car!

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:15.133 line:85.83%,end
Stop the car! Now--

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:20.180 line:85.83%,end
<i>Saying it was likely to be
the spies' second attempt to abduct him,</i>

00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:23.224 line:85.83%,end
<i>the CPAJ denied the rumor
about him defecting to the North.</i>

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:27.395 line:85.83%,end
<i>And the opposition party is claiming that
the current administration is behind it,</i>

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.689 line:85.83%,end
<i>so it's expected to have a huge impact.</i>

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.360 line:85.83%,end
<i>Reporting from Yeyeon Cathedral,
I'm Gal Sang-sik, JBC.</i>

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.664 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****!

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:47.582 line:85.83%,end
Why me, sir?

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:50.460 line:85.83%,end
I'll fix it.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.712 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean, fix it?

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:53.797 line:85.83%,end
It's in the news!

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.507 line:85.83%,end
How will you fix it?

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.550 line:85.83%,end
You bastard. It's hot! Stop right there!

00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.429 line:85.83%,end
-First, I'll sue them for defaming ANSP.
-Come here. Why you…

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.973 line:85.83%,end
-Come here, you bastard.
-And, sir,

00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:07.769 line:85.83%,end
I'll issue summonses against
the CPAJ and that bastard Gal Sang-sik.

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.938 line:85.83%,end
-What? You idiot!
-Stop the nonsense and get out!

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.443 line:85.83%,end
-Well…
-Everyone, out.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.569 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.822 line:85.83%,end
-You should go home.
-Okay.

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.031 line:85.83%,end
Get out.

00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:23.785 line:85.83%,end
Where are you going, you idiots?
Come back here!

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:25.995 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:27.747 line:85.83%,end
Are you crazy?

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:29.666 line:85.83%,end
Why did you tell them to leave?

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:34.003 line:85.83%,end
We must press charges, make up evidence
that he was defecting, and make it public!

00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:36.756 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:40.301 line:85.83%,end
Did you find anything useful in Han's bag?

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:44.472 line:85.83%,end
Well, we found a letter
from his son in Pyongyang--

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:47.684 line:85.83%,end
Why have you still not used it?
Make it public now!

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:49.310 line:85.83%,end
Fabricate evidence if necessary!

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.353 line:85.83%,end
Shut up!

00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:53.815 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:57.819 line:85.83%,end
"Shut up"?

00:28:58.361 --> 00:28:59.779 line:85.83%,end
Fabricate evidence?

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:03.408 line:85.83%,end
We've given the press guidelines
every morning trying to shut them up,

00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:04.492 line:85.83%,end
but it didn't work!

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:09.289 line:85.83%,end
They have hard evidence. You think you can
cover it up with fabricated evidence?

00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.749 line:85.83%,end
Then what?

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:12.876 line:85.83%,end
We just let the opposition party
have their way?

00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:15.587 line:85.83%,end
Our candidate will lose the election
for sure at this rate.

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:22.594 line:85.83%,end
Pick it up.

00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:29.559 line:85.83%,end
Eun Chang-su speaking.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.564 line:85.83%,end
It seems plan B also failed.

00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:40.195 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:41.446 line:85.83%,end
I'll find the--

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:44.949 line:85.83%,end
Come in by five with a solution.

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.244 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:00.632 line:85.83%,end
-What did he say?
-To come in by five.

00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:02.425 line:85.83%,end
What? What do we do?

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.720 line:85.83%,end
This is bad. We'll catch hell
if we go without a solution.

00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:08.139 line:85.83%,end
Wait, Eun!

00:30:08.848 --> 00:30:10.016 line:85.83%,end
-Wait.
-Then we should…

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.354 line:85.83%,end
come up with a solution.
