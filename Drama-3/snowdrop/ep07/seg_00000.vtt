EPISODE 7

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.913 line:14.17%,start
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.084 line:14.17%,start
You leave.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.003 line:14.17%,start
This is our dorm.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.090 line:14.17%,start
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.927 line:14.17%,start
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:35.678 line:14.17%,start
Keep your heads down!

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.105 line:85.83%,end
You…

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.942 line:85.83%,end
You don't know who I am, do you?

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.280 line:85.83%,end
Why can't I hear them?

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.450 line:85.83%,end
I think she's speaking too quietly.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.493 line:85.83%,end
Turn the volume up then!

00:01:59.077 --> 00:01:59.953 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.676 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.642 line:85.83%,end
I'm…

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.230 line:85.83%,end
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.574 line:85.83%,end
If you don't believe me,
go check with them.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.706 line:85.83%,end
Eun Chang-su,

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.625 line:85.83%,end
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.588 line:85.83%,end
is my father.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.174 line:85.83%,end
-I can't hear her. What's she saying?
-Why is she whispering?

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.091 line:85.83%,end
I don't know.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:24.954 line:85.83%,end
Let them go.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.457 line:85.83%,end
Let them all go!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.459 line:85.83%,end
It's working again.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.351 line:85.83%,end
<i>You will never…</i>

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:50.939 line:85.83%,end
<i>get a chance to be released again.</i>

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.510 line:85.83%,end
Since she doesn't want to leave,

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:23.304 line:85.83%,end
only nine will be released.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.689 line:85.83%,end
You evil bastard.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.400 line:85.83%,end
Release one more person
since I'm not leaving!

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.567 line:85.83%,end
Who do you think you are?

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:38.778 line:85.83%,end
To me, you are…

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.741 line:85.83%,end
just…

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.746 line:85.83%,end
a human shield.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.047 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.800 line:85.83%,end
Have her stand by the windows.
