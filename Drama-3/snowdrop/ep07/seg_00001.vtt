00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.138 line:85.83%,end
Now!

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.481 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Hall Director.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.972 line:85.83%,end
The daughter of the ANSP director
has been living in the dorm.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.433 line:85.83%,end
<i>That must've been bothering you.</i>

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.106 line:85.83%,end
<i>Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?</i>

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.400 line:85.83%,end
I heard the ANSP director is

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.153 line:85.83%,end
one of the most
powerful people in the South.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.822 line:85.83%,end
And such a person's daughter
living in the dorm?

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.409 line:85.83%,end
Did Yeong-ro tell you herself that she is

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.536 line:85.83%,end
<i>the daughter of the ANSP director?</i>

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.664 line:85.83%,end
<i>She was quiet about it</i>

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.458 line:85.83%,end
even when she was
being kicked out of here.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:17.752 line:85.83%,end
Kicked out?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.215 line:85.83%,end
It was decided she leave the dorm
as a punishment for hiding you.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.385 line:85.83%,end
She hid him?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.220 line:85.83%,end
Hid the communist spy?

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.721 line:85.83%,end
Your daughter really did it?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.892 line:85.83%,end
<i>She helped you because she believed
she was doing the right thing.</i>

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:38.314 line:85.83%,end
<i>So he was willing to accept any punishment
without any regret or reflection.</i>

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.318 line:85.83%,end
<i>But her courage and sacrifice ended up</i>

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.113 line:85.83%,end
<i>putting everyone in the dorm in danger.</i>

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:51.160 line:85.83%,end
So imagine
how Yeong-ro must be feeling right now.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.996 line:85.83%,end
If you can understand that
even just a little bit,

00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:59.127 line:85.83%,end
it's only right for you
to release as many hostages as possible.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.213 line:85.83%,end
That isâ€¦

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.051 line:85.83%,end
the least you can do for her,

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.303 line:85.83%,end
who saved you risking her life.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.730 line:85.83%,end
I think I made it very clear
that only nine hostages will be released.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.566 line:85.83%,end
You were her partner at the Open House.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.985 line:85.83%,end
I remember that you seemed quite nervous.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.070 line:85.83%,end
Was it all for show?

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.531 line:85.83%,end
To take full advantage of Yeong-ro?

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:29.615 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.165 line:85.83%,end
I need to go to

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.167 line:85.83%,end
the bathroom first.

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.435 line:85.83%,end
RESTROOM

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.777 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol doesn't look good.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.404 line:85.83%,end
Can we

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.780 line:85.83%,end
trust that doctor?

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.827 line:85.83%,end
The hall director's in the restroom.
Bring her when she's done.

00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:26.816 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? Hurry up.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.320 line:85.83%,end
Just give me a second.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.430 line:85.83%,end
I can see the students are safe.

00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:59.640 line:85.83%,end
Now I need to see
if my team leader is okay.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.017 line:85.83%,end
Where's he now?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.686 line:85.83%,end
Not now.
