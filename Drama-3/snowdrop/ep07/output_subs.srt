EPISODE 7

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,913
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,084
You leave.

5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,003
This is our dorm.

6
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,090
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

7
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,927
Oh, my goodness.

8
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,678
Keep your heads down!

9
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,105
You…

10
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,942
You don't know who I am, do you?

11
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,280
Why can't I hear them?

12
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,450
I think she's speaking too quietly.

13
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,493
Turn the volume up then!

14
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,953
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,676
I'll tell you.

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,642
I'm…

17
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,230
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,574
If you don't believe me,
go check with them.

19
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,706
Eun Chang-su,

20
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,625
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

21
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,588
is my father.

22
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,174
-I can't hear her. What's she saying?
-Why is she whispering?

23
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,091
I don't know.

24
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,954
Let them go.

25
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,457
Let them all go!

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,459
It's working again.

27
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,351
<i>You will never…</i>

28
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,939
<i>get a chance to be released again.</i>

29
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,510
Since she doesn't want to leave,

30
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,304
only nine will be released.

31
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,689
You evil bastard.

32
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,400
Release one more person
since I'm not leaving!

33
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,567
Who do you think you are?

34
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,778
To me, you are…

35
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,741
just…

36
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,746
a human shield.

37
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,047
Comrade Joo.

38
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,800
Have her stand by the windows.

39
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,138
Now!

40
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,481
Ms. Hall Director.

41
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,972
The daughter of the ANSP director
has been living in the dorm.

42
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,433
<i>That must've been bothering you.</i>

43
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?</i>

44
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,400
I heard the ANSP director is

45
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,153
one of the most
powerful people in the South.

46
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,822
And such a person's daughter
living in the dorm?

47
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,409
Did Yeong-ro tell you herself that she is

48
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,536
<i>the daughter of the ANSP director?</i>

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,664
<i>She was quiet about it</i>

50
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,458
even when she was
being kicked out of here.

51
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,752
Kicked out?

52
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,215
It was decided she leave the dorm
as a punishment for hiding you.

53
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,385
She hid him?

54
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,220
Hid the communist spy?

55
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,721
Your daughter really did it?

56
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,892
<i>She helped you because she believed
she was doing the right thing.</i>

57
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:38,314
<i>So he was willing to accept any punishment
without any regret or reflection.</i>

58
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>But her courage and sacrifice ended up</i>

59
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,113
<i>putting everyone in the dorm in danger.</i>

60
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,160
So imagine
how Yeong-ro must be feeling right now.

61
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,996
If you can understand that
even just a little bit,

62
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,127
it's only right for you
to release as many hostages as possible.

63
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,213
That is…

64
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,051
the least you can do for her,

65
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,303
who saved you risking her life.

66
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,730
I think I made it very clear
that only nine hostages will be released.

67
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,566
You were her partner at the Open House.

68
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,985
I remember that you seemed quite nervous.

69
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,070
Was it all for show?

70
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,531
To take full advantage of Yeong-ro?

71
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,615
Let's go.

72
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,165
I need to go to

73
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
the bathroom first.

74
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,435
RESTROOM

75
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,777
Eung-cheol doesn't look good.

76
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,404
Can we

77
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,780
trust that doctor?

78
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,827
The hall director's in the restroom.
Bring her when she's done.

79
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,816
What are you doing? Hurry up.

80
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,320
Just give me a second.

81
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,430
I can see the students are safe.

82
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,640
Now I need to see
if my team leader is okay.

83
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,017
Where's he now?

84
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,686
Not now.

85
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,274
He can't have surgery
until his fever breaks anyway.

86
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,697
I mean, the doctor's doing nothing, so how
about my team leader get surgery first?

87
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,084
He has a gunshot wound.

88
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,170
He needs surgery as soon as possible.

89
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,505
-What's wrong with treating him while--
-Hey!

90
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,216
Are you kidding?

91
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,469
He shot at me,
and you want us to let him get treated?

92
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,891
Keep your word.

93
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,810
You promised to release hostages,
let me check the students' safety,

94
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,438
and let the doctor do surgery
on my team leader.

95
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,067
I brought Dr. Kang here
because you agreed on those terms.

96
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,823
You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?

97
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,745
I'll kill you first if anything goes
wrong, so don't mess with me.

98
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,801
How is he?

99
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,638
His temperature's still 38°C,
and it's not going down.

100
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,418
It's because the infection caused
a high white blood cell count.

101
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,587
I gave him a fever reducer,
so it'll go down in two to three hours.

102
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,513
<i>SWAT team breaking in soon.</i>

103
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,348
<i>The whole dorm is being wiretapped.</i>

104
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,779
Then why don't you treat
their team leader until then?

105
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,073
I think that's better as well.

106
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,875
The ANSP team leader
will be treated first.

107
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,501
Comrade.

108
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,425
Treat him? We should be killing him.

109
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,639
For now, it's most important
to maintain mutual trust.

110
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,185
<i>Trust?</i>

111
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,271
Their goal is killing us.
How can we trust them?

112
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,110
Just keep an eye on the hostages.
That's your job.

113
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,323
Especially those by the windows.

114
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,249
Didn't you say
there was no problem with her?

115
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,628
Yes, according to
all those weekly reports!

116
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,547
That damn Pi.

117
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,841
She even went through
water and electric torture.

118
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,718
How dare she stab me in the back?

119
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,364
My goodness.

120
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,491
I got to say,

121
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,743
you are indeed a liability.

122
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,037
A liability to us.

123
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,624
Even your child
has become a liability now.

124
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,459
Unbelievable.

125
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,086
Oh, right.

126
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,880
-Hey, An.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,467
Does hiding a communist spy
count as espionage?

128
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,972
To be precise,
it's aiding and abetting espionage.

129
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,807
My God.

130
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,058
The ANSP director

131
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,895
should be in the vanguard
of anti-communism and counterespionage.

132
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,980
You're a disgrace to our country.

133
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,773
Don't you think?

134
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
I was just kidding.

135
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>By the way, ma'am,</i>

136
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,709
I know he said
it should be 13 young virgins,

137
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,836
but does it have to be exactly 13?

138
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,634
As a matter of fact,

139
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,304
I was dying to know about that all night,

140
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,058
so I called the fortuneteller
first thing in the morning.

141
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,314
What did he say?

142
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,609
He said it should be

143
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,277
exactly 13 virgins.

144
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,404
No more, no less.

145
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
Exactly 13.

146
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,493
Then it's very unlikely.

147
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,164
I mean, how will the spies kill

148
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,292
exactly 13 as if they know about it?

149
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,129
There are more than 70 hostages
in the dorm.

150
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,756
My goodness.

151
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,549
That many?

152
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,592
Yes.

153
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,760
That reminds me.

154
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,638
They're supposed to release
some of the hostages today.

155
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,724
Release?

156
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,102
How many?

157
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,939
Well, as many as the spies want, I guess.

158
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,734
Yes, I guess so.

159
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,122
What kind of man is
Eun Chang-su, the ANSP director?

160
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,047
Do you want me

161
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,507
to brief you on my boss?

162
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,384
<i>Brief a Northern spy?</i>

163
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,512
<i>I'm holding tens of students hostage,</i>

164
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,306
<i>yet he's fooled me twice.</i>

165
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,683
Is he foolish enough
to try to fool me again?

166
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>Was Cheong-ya caught?</i>

167
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,938
<i>Was Han-na caught?</i>

168
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,149
<i>The ANSP director is
dealing with you himself?</i>

169
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,693
<i>A mere Northern spy like you?</i>

170
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,612
The director himself?

171
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,322
His daughter is being held hostage,

172
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,992
so I'm sure he ran over in a rush.

173
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>The director's daughter?</i>

174
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,757
The whole building is
rigged with C4 bombs,

175
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,759
from basement two to the third floor.

176
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,054
<i>If you try to deceive me again,</i>

177
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,473
<i>the bombs will go off all at once.</i>

178
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,643
Check if it's true.

179
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,979
If I push this button,

180
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,023
you, I,

181
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,526
and the 70 hostages

182
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,403
will all die.

183
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,864
Then

184
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,033
Director Eun Chang-su

185
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,286
<i>won't even find his daughter's body.</i>

186
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,916
How dare that bastard
threaten him like that?

187
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,045
Wait, Eun.

188
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,464
Don't tell me you believe that bulls***.

189
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,632
I should.

190
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,884
If the bombs explode
and the students get killed,

191
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,927
what will you do?

192
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,638
<i>You'll blow yourself and your men up?</i>

193
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,017
Aren't you their leader?

194
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,311
Is Geum-cheol's death not enough?

195
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,313
Are you going
to lead the rest to death too?

196
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,026
I'll do anything for my men's honor.

197
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,613
I won't let them die as traitors.

198
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,200
I'd rather blow ourselves up

199
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,953
to die heroes for my country.

200
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
What is this?

201
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,465
Don't tell me

202
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,218
what he just said is scaring you.

203
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,095
My goodness.

204
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,766
You're too chicken to serve the country.

205
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,685
We can just get them all at once

206
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,146
before they blow themselves up.

207
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,690
Get them all at once? How?

208
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,986
I knew this might happen,
so I already put another plan into action.

209
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,827
Dr. Kang will knock out two
of the communist spies with injections,

210
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,329
so all you need to do

211
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,081
is get rid of the booby traps
on basement two.

212
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,169
Then our SWAT team
will go in secretly and kill

213
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,713
the last one.

214
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,924
I understand, sir.

215
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,010
<i>I call it</i>

216
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>"Operation One-shot-two-kills."</i>

217
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,309
<i>Saving your daughter and getting them
at the same time. What do you think?</i>

218
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,102
Isn't it a good plan?

219
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,064
Are you insane? They'll blow themselves up
if we fool them again.

220
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,023
But what?

221
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,276
I can't believe this.

222
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,737
My, this is so frustrating.

223
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,324
Teaching at the Military Academy
suits you better.

224
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,201
Why are you even the ANSP director?

225
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,628
Mr. Lee.

226
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,135
Are you all right?

227
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,518
Let go of him!

228
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,815
A gun in the medical kit.

229
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,734
SWAT team breaking in
via an emergency exit.

230
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,112
Are you all right, Mr. Lee?

231
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
Are you okay?

232
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,126
How could you make him suffer like that?

233
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,336
He's your hostage.
Is this really necessary?

234
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,588
Didn't you people kill Geum-cheol?

235
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,718
No, we didn't.

236
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,306
He took cyanide and dropped dead
according to that stupid manual of yours.

237
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,980
Drop dead?

238
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,443
Don't speak ill of our late comrade.

239
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,363
Do you understand?

240
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,743
You idiot!

241
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,331
Didn't I tell you
to always keep your temper?

242
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,375
Are you stupid? You're not even armed.

243
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,020
Don't cross the line.

244
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,611
If you want to maintain our mutual trust.

245
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,533
Should I see his wound?

246
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,299
You follow me.

247
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,762
<i>I'll release some of the hostages.</i>

248
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,445
Don't shoot!

249
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,910
You can come out.

250
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,830
It's all right.

251
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,540
Go.

252
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,083
It's okay. Don't worry.

253
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,462
Let's go!

254
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,221
-The hostages are coming out. Move!
-Help them to safety!

255
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,183
Go, go.

256
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,060
Hurry up!

257
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,774
Stop.

258
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,027
Get them into the ambulance
and the rest into the van.

259
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,112
Yes, sir.

260
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,698
Move it!

261
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,411
-Hey, leave right away.
-Yes, sir.

262
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,997
-Get them in now.
-Yes, sir.

263
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,419
They're all being moved.

264
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,046
Make sure they all keep their mouths shut.

265
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,381
Yes, sir.

266
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,357
Well, I sent five injured students

267
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,234
to the ANSP-designated hospital.

268
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,196
And as for the remaining four,

269
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,073
I sent them to our agency for questioning.

270
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,867
-Salute!
-Salute!

271
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,957
Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,918
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

273
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,794
What a surprise.

274
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,590
You guys must not have had anything to eat
since last night.

275
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,219
Hello, Mr. Nam.

276
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,640
Honey.

277
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,480
We were starving, actually.

278
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,567
Oh, my, ma'am. It doesn't look like food.

279
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,695
It looks like artwork.
It's too pretty to eat.

280
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,451
I must say,

281
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,080
you sure are full of surprises.

282
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,500
You have such a considerate wife.
You're so lucky.

283
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,838
All right. Let's dig in.

284
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,133
In any case, some of the hostages
have been released.

285
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,094
Let's eat and get back
to fighting those spies.

286
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
All right, guys. Let's dig in!

287
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,640
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

288
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,225
Thank you, ma'am.

289
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,230
Come eat.

290
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,031
-What is it?
-You should see the news.

291
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,621
<i>Controversy arose over Professor Han</i>

292
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,456
-What?
<i>-who was found dead on a Northern</i>

293
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,499
<i>-spy boat.</i>
-It's Gal.

294
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,045
<i>There was a suspicion that the economics
professor tried to defect to the North,</i>

295
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,715
<i>but decisive evidence has been revealed</i>

296
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,925
<i>that the North in fact
tried to abduct him.</i>

297
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,929
<i>According to the Catholic Priests
Association for Justice,</i>

298
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,725
<i>Priest Kim Hyeon-seung received
a tape recording from Han I-seop,</i>

299
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,395
<i>and the tape contains the voice of the spy</i>

300
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,273
<i>who tried to abduct him on November 27.</i>

301
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,942
What did you just say?

302
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,571
Where did you say my son is?
He's studying in the US.

303
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,575
Your son isn't in Boston.
He's in Pyongyang.

304
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,744
In Pyongyang?

305
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,621
Who are you?

306
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,205
Who are you people?

307
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,583
Did you kidnap my son?

308
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,502
If you want to save him,
come with us to Pyongyang.

309
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,587
Stop the car!

310
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,880
Stop the car!

311
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,133
Stop the car! Now--

312
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:20,180
<i>Saying it was likely to be
the spies' second attempt to abduct him,</i>

313
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,224
<i>the CPAJ denied the rumor
about him defecting to the North.</i>

314
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,395
<i>And the opposition party is claiming that
the current administration is behind it,</i>

315
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,689
<i>so it's expected to have a huge impact.</i>

316
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,360
<i>Reporting from Yeyeon Cathedral,
I'm Gal Sang-sik, JBC.</i>

317
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,664
You son of a b****!

318
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,582
Why me, sir?

319
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,460
I'll fix it.

320
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,712
What do you mean, fix it?

321
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,797
It's in the news!

322
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,507
How will you fix it?

323
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,550
You bastard. It's hot! Stop right there!

324
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,429
-First, I'll sue them for defaming ANSP.
-Come here. Why you…

325
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,973
-Come here, you bastard.
-And, sir,

326
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,769
I'll issue summonses against
the CPAJ and that bastard Gal Sang-sik.

327
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,938
-What? You idiot!
-Stop the nonsense and get out!

328
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,443
-Well…
-Everyone, out.

329
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,569
Hey.

330
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,822
-You should go home.
-Okay.

331
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,031
Get out.

332
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,785
Where are you going, you idiots?
Come back here!

333
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,995
Hey.

334
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,747
Are you crazy?

335
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,666
Why did you tell them to leave?

336
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:34,003
We must press charges, make up evidence
that he was defecting, and make it public!

337
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,756
Hey!

338
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,301
Did you find anything useful in Han's bag?

339
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,472
Well, we found a letter
from his son in Pyongyang--

340
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,684
Why have you still not used it?
Make it public now!

341
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,310
Fabricate evidence if necessary!

342
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,353
Shut up!

343
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,815
What?

344
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,819
"Shut up"?

345
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,779
Fabricate evidence?

346
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,408
We've given the press guidelines
every morning trying to shut them up,

347
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,492
but it didn't work!

348
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,289
They have hard evidence. You think you can
cover it up with fabricated evidence?

349
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,749
Then what?

350
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,876
We just let the opposition party
have their way?

351
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,587
Our candidate will lose the election
for sure at this rate.

352
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,594
Pick it up.

353
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,559
Eun Chang-su speaking.

354
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,564
It seems plan B also failed.

355
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,195
I'm sorry, sir.

356
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,446
I'll find the--

357
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,949
Come in by five with a solution.

358
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,244
Yes, sir.

359
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,632
-What did he say?
-To come in by five.

360
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,425
What? What do we do?

361
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,720
This is bad. We'll catch hell
if we go without a solution.

362
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,139
Wait, Eun!

363
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,016
-Wait.
-Then we should…

364
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,354
come up with a solution.

365
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,567
We should let the press know

366
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
about the hostage situation in the dorm.

367
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,947
Are you crazy? Yeong-ro is in there.

368
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,159
If we also reveal the fact that
they have the ANSP director's daughter,

369
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,453
I doubt they'll hurt our Yeong-ro.

370
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,540
But they already know she's my daughter.

371
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,875
They're still willing
to die with the hostages.

372
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,879
If they find out we've told the press,
they might blow themselves up.

373
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,465
Then we should

374
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,636
make the North order them
not to blow themselves up.

375
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,806
That's impossible.
They want us to send them back unscathed.

376
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,600
We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.

377
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,103
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars

378
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,814
just to save those expendable spies?

379
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,862
The presidential election is in ten days.

380
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,072
You can take care of this
after the election's won.

381
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,782
If we make this drag on

382
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,869
and be in the news every day
up until the election,

383
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,872
nobody will pay attention
to Han I-seop's case.

384
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,290
Definitely.

385
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,210
Hoping to fight against the Northern spies
holding the girls hostage,

386
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,797
I'm sure people will vote
for candidate Park Mu-yeol.

387
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,257
Exactly.

388
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,682
I'll talk to Lim Ji-rok then.

389
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
Withdraw the SWAT team right away.

390
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,104
I'll take care of that.

391
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,232
So you go do your job.
Hurry up. We have no time to lose.

392
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,902
Hey! Get me the radio!

393
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,821
SWAT team, stand by. Don't do anything!

394
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,366
<i>Anyone move a finger,
and I'll kill that bastard myself!</i>

395
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,915
Get dressings ready.

396
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,291
Okay.

397
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,711
Give me the gun.

398
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,339
Now.

399
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,860
This is bad.

400
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,321
I totally forgot about it.

401
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,074
I'm supposed to meet Antonio
at Rome Coffee Shop at five.

402
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,827
What if he thinks I stood him up?

403
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,620
Are you serious right now?

404
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,163
Antonio?

405
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,543
What about your lovers here?

406
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,672
Are you seriously worried about that now?

407
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,133
I guess you haven't heard yet.

408
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,969
She and Gwang-tae are through.

409
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:37,056
And she's started seeing Antonio
this month. To learn Italian.

410
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,518
Oh, no.

411
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,311
The criminal law final is tomorrow.

412
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,188
They must know
we're being held here, right?

413
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,690
They won't hold the exam, right?

414
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,365
Did she just laugh? Hey.

415
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,367
What's so funny?

416
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,454
You leech living off the tuition we pay.

417
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,122
What?

418
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,124
"Leech living off the tuition we pay"?

419
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,043
What? Am I wrong?

420
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,669
That's what you are.

421
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,587
Don't you agree?

422
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,921
Hey, Polka Dot.

423
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,466
Shut your trap.

424
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,190
You confidently promised to get
300 million dollars from them in ten days.

425
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,153
Rescuing your son
as well as getting 300 million dollars…

426
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,239
Will that be really possible?

427
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,960
<i>Despite knowing it's impossible,</i>

428
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,463
<i>he's trying to buy time.</i>

429
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,092
<i>The almighty Lim Ji-rok is also</i>

430
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,677
<i>just another father who loves his child.</i>

431
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,118
Lim Ji-rok speaking.

432
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,702
Mr. Lim.

433
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,581
I'm sorry about last time. I apologize.

434
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,166
It was so urgent that--

435
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,085
<i>When on earth are you going to send</i>

436
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,379
our agents in the dorm back to us?

437
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,882
It's been exposed that Han was abducted

438
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,176
and not defecting to the North.

439
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,138
So Aemin Party is
in a tough spot right now.

440
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,181
That's your problem.

441
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,518
Send our agents
back to the North right away!

442
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,270
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

443
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,272
but we have no choice but to make

444
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,190
the hostage situation public.

445
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,775
<i>What?</i>

446
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,443
The hostage situation?

447
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,326
What on earth is your big plan
you want to carry out?

448
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,163
As for the spies, how about we kill

449
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,165
all three?

450
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,416
Kill all three?

451
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,586
Are you seriously
thinking of killing them all?

452
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,463
Sir, it's just three spies.
If you sacrifice them,

453
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,507
you'll get 300 million dollars.

454
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,926
Just three spies?

455
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,221
<i>Send our agents back to us unscathed!</i>

456
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,724
Send them back right away! If you don't,

457
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,767
there will be war! You hear me?

458
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,812
Sir.

459
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,238
Yeon-hwa!

460
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,951
Send them a message

461
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,370
that they must come back alive! Now!

462
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,039
Yes, sir.

463
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,998
Anyway,

464
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,418
the Secretary's Office wants
to see you right now.

465
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,837
Right now?

466
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,232
Mr. Lim?

467
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,611
This is Choi Su-ryeon,
the deputy director of MSS.

468
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,780
I see.

469
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,074
You'll have to negotiate with me
from now on.

470
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,410
<i>I'm sure</i>

471
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,288
our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.

472
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,292
Kill them.

473
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,537
Comrade Choi Su-ryeon just told
the South to kill all of our spies.

474
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,142
STOP
SECURITY CHECKPOINT

475
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,814
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

476
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,024
What's going on?

477
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,239
You did well.

478
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,538
Could you put the rifle away?

479
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,874
Don't you know
about the Geneva Conventions?

480
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,003
Even during war, you can't attack any
of your enemy's medical staff or hospitals

481
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,713
that wounded soldiers are in.

482
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,350
What did you do to him?
Why isn't he waking up?

483
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
Midazolam is

484
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,689
a sedative you use before surgery.

485
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,610
Hold on.

486
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,912
Stand up.

487
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,107
Look. How could you suspect the doctor?

488
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,193
If they wanted to kill you,
they wouldn't have sent in a doctor,

489
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,694
but an armed agent.

490
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,428
Calm down. She's just a doctor!

491
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,013
Stop!

492
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,446
What's going on?

493
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,072
Why is there music playing?

494
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,824
Why? Fix it! Now!

495
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,451
Fix it! Hurry up!

496
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,330
Why is there music playing? Fix it!

497
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,249
Fix it, you bastards!

498
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,809
I didn't know. I swear!
I didn't know about it.

499
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,770
Comrade.

500
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,563
I found a pistol in her bag.

501
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,898
A pistol!

502
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,239
You found it, so let it go.

503
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,796
They've deceived us three times,
but what? "Let it go"?

504
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,132
They're looking down on us
because you're so soft!

505
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,791
What the hell are you doing?

506
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,227
It's an emergency.

507
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,604
<i>The doctor's in danger.</i>

508
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,689
<i>It's an emergency. The doctor's in danger.</i>

509
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,775
Which sniper was that?

510
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,569
-Which one?
-It was number 14.

511
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,322
-Go find out where it is. Now!
-Stand by!

512
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,290
It's the back side of Mount Ogong.

513
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,877
Stand by!

514
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,847
You've deceived us three times!

515
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,351
You're forcing us to kill her!

516
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,604
Come here!

517
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,773
Don't shoot!

518
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,107
<i>Please don't!</i>

519
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,901
Don't shoot!

520
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,570
Sniper… Sniper!

521
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,531
Hey, kill that communist bastard
right now!

522
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,449
Now!

523
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,117
But the doctor's in the way.

524
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:26,747
That little… That piece of…

525
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,458
How dare those bastards try to harm my…

526
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,794
F***!

527
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,254
You have to save her!

528
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,798
-At all costs!
-Yes, sir.

529
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,466
-You bastards.
-I'm sorry, sir.

530
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,719
If you fail to save Dr. Kang,
I'll kill all of you.

531
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,639
-Save her! At all cost! Understand?
-It's dangerous.

532
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,641
You bastard!

533
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,644
Cheong-ya…

534
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,443
Are you insane?

535
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,529
We need her to save Eung-cheol!

536
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,157
Let go of me. We need
to teach them a lesson right now.

537
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,368
Comrade Joo!

538
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,416
Ma'am, please do something.

539
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,502
Come! Now!

540
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,045
Come here!

541
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,007
I'll kill her!

542
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,888
Let go!

543
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:30,894
Hey.

544
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,528
Let go.

545
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,071
Let go!

546
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,698
Gyeok-chan.

547
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,700
Calm down.

548
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,410
Please.

549
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,715
Hey.

550
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,158
Stay away!

551
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,835
Put it down.

552
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,133
Oh, no. Yeong-ro's in danger.

553
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,469
-This is bad.
-Hey.

554
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,932
Put the gun down. Now.

555
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,767
Or you'll get hurt.

556
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,400
Let the doctor go. Now!

557
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,401
Do you want to die?

558
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,198
Your teammate…

559
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,326
No! Easy, easy.

560
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,625
Your teammate

561
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,419
hasn't been treated yet.

562
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,880
He'll die if he doesn't get treated.

563
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,007
For sure.

564
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,595
Comrade Joo.

565
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,600
If you kill the doctor, they'll never

566
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,144
send in another doctor.

567
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,357
You've been fooled three times.

568
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,527
Shouldn't you take advantage
of this chance?

569
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,699
They have no choice but to do what you ask
because you might blow yourselves up.

570
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,201
Oh, right.

571
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,537
To get out of here safely,

572
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,874
you also need
a means of transportation. Right?

573
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,761
Comrade Joo.

574
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,390
Lower the gun.

575
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,687
Now!

576
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,742
Those damn bastards!

577
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,537
I'll kill you all!

578
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,082
Hey! Don't fire back!

579
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,584
Everyone get down!

580
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,419
Hold fire! Don't fire back!

581
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,178
Come on!

582
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,788
Stop wasting the bullets.

583
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,788
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

584
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,715
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

585
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,374
IT'S NOT THAT I MISS YOU
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE

586
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,054
Take your hands off the door.

587
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,474
The SWAT team is standing by outside.

588
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,312
Take your hands off it
if you want to live.

589
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:25,785
Even if you shoot me, they'll break in
since I disabled the booby trap.

590
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,041
You know what this is, right?

591
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,133
If I push this button, you and I,
as well as the hostages, will all die.

592
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,599
You want to save your team leader,

593
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,185
don't you?

594
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,648
He even got shot to protect you.

595
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,864
If you want to save him,

596
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,367
go out and stop the SWAT team.

597
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,171
SWAT team, go in! Now!

598
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,631
SWAT team, go in!

599
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,135
SWAT team, go in!

600
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,896
SWAT team, go in! You bastards!

601
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,530
<i>Hey, are you sure
the wiretapping is working?</i>

602
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,865
Why can't I hear anything?
Turn the volume up!

603
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,033
Turn it up!

604
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,708
Turn it up, you idiots! God damn it!

605
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,296
Eun, how did it go?

606
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,630
Did you talk to them?

607
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,592
See? I told you.

608
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:10,432
In any case, I'm worried how much more
Lim Ji-rok will demand this time.

609
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,017
He's not in charge anymore.

610
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,227
We negotiate with Choi Su-ryeon now.

611
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,438
What? Why?

612
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,232
What's going on?

613
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,776
Why are we not sending the SWAT team in?

614
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,029
We must send them in!

615
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,196
How dare you--

616
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,869
It's me.

617
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,455
You said you'd send us
back to the North safely,

618
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,082
but you're sending the SWAT team in?

619
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,335
Sending the SWAT team in?

620
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,880
Hey! It's all a lie!
Our agent lied to you!

621
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,341
She lied to make you surrender!

622
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,342
Give it!

623
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,762
<i>Listen. First, let Cheong-- No.</i>

624
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,888
Let the doctor out.

625
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,099
Let Dr. Kang out right now, you bastard!

626
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,773
How did you find out your agent talked
about the SWAT team in the tent?

627
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,364
He wants to talk to you.

628
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,242
The hostages' lives are
at stake, but what?

629
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,119
It's all a lie?

630
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,788
Seriously?

631
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,956
All right.

632
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,416
Get her out of here!

633
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,960
Yes, sir. Come out here.

634
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,171
Hey, Choi.

635
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
Come here.

636
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,591
Let go of me!

637
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,433
There must've been

638
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,852
<i>a misunderstanding.
We didn't try to send them in.</i>

639
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,563
-We just wanted to send you back--
<i>-No.</i>

640
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,192
I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.

641
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,949
If you don't believe me,
check with the North.

642
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,450
Check the instructions.

643
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,914
You tell me to check the instructions
whenever you're cornered.

644
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,544
Last time we followed the instructions,
we got shot at upon getting out.

645
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,005
That was because of the engagement
on the West Sea. I told you!

646
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,549
Does the leadership in the North

647
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,010
know that you tried to kill us?

648
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,515
They do know all three of you are alive.

649
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,104
Seeing how you know our rendezvous point

650
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,441
and the goal of this mission well,

651
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,527
you must be in close liaison
with the leadership in the North.

652
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,783
What kind of deal did you make?

653
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,996
<i>You'd better be honest with me.</i>

654
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,167
Your daughter's in my hands.

655
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,544
You know that, right?

656
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,300
<i>You are</i>

657
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,928
a spy who must obey
orders from your country.

658
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,890
<i>So check the instructions right now!</i>

659
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,271
I wanted us to talk it out
before I make you pay for fooling us.

660
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,814
But it's not working.

661
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,941
Listen carefully.

662
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,862
I'll pick a hostage at random
and kill them in ten minutes.

663
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,780
What?

664
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,659
And that student's death
will be all on you.

665
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,621
Hello?

666
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,955
Hello?

667
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,041
Turn the volume up!

668
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,584
Turn it up!

669
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,045
"Student"? He definitely said student.

670
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,239
Are you really going to kill them?

671
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,619
I should.

672
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,955
Who do you think we should kill?

673
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,711
<i>The one who called us communist bastards…</i>

674
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,423
Shouldn't we kill that one first?

675
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,969
So you're saying
we should kill Eun Yeong-ro first, right?

676
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,226
Okay.

677
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,770
Kill her.

678
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,297
It's not working, is it?

679
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,381
Why can't I hear anything?

680
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,634
The wiretapping in Area 2-4 is cut off.

681
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,469
What?

682
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,060
Eun Yeong-ro's
the daughter of the ANSP director.

683
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,567
Which means she's our lifeline.

684
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,160
<i>-Area 2-4…</i>
-Area 2-2 is cut off.

685
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,828
<i>-Can any sniper see her?</i>
-What?

686
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,538
<i>I repeat. Area 2-4--</i>

687
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,968
-Hey, An!
-Yes, sir.

688
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,428
One moment, sir.

689
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,013
Area 2-3 is not working as well!

690
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:42,930
Forget that.

691
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,266
Area 1-1 is not working as well!

692
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,935
Don't just say that!
Find the ones still working!

693
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,312
Check if there's any working!

694
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,313
Hurry up.

695
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,985
What the hell are you doing?

696
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,634
Please.

697
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,472
Damn it.

698
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,646
Hey.

699
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,632
I got rid of all the bugs.

700
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,593
You can talk freely now.

701
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,970
What's going on?

702
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,236
<i>Lim Soo-ho?</i>

703
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,405
<i>This is the ANSP director.</i>

704
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,539
Comrade Joo Gyeok-chan.

705
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,420
You were fearless and worthy of the Order
of Military Service Honor you got.

706
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:26,219
I was instructed to come here
to send you back to the North safely.

707
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,972
I'm Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

708
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,269
And I'm also known as Moran Hill 1
in our country.

709
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,565
Moran Hill…

710
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,986
The one awarded the Hero of the Republic?

711
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,285
I apologize. I should have recognized you.

712
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,205
I provoked you on purpose
to fool the others,

713
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,248
so don't worry.

714
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,168
<i>Lim Soo-ho! Can you hear me?</i>

715
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,389
Lim Soo-ho. You and I may

716
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,309
believe in different things in different
situations, but we want the same thing.

717
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,311
You want your men's safety,

718
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,479
and I want

719
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,274
the hostages' safety.

720
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,859
Now,

721
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,195
<i>the director of the Agency
for National Security Planning</i>

722
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,282
<i>desperately wants to talk with you.</i>

723
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,619
Pick up the phone!

724
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,371
You can hear me, right?

725
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,207
Let's talk it out! Please!

726
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,168
-Those bastards.
<i>-Lim Soo-ho!</i>

727
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,838
They wiretapped us, and what? Talk it out?

728
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,382
They can hear me, right?

729
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:50,469
Actually, the ANSP director told me
to check the party's instructions,

730
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:53,764
so I took you here to check them with you.

731
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,529
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

732
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,490
If you kill any of the students,

733
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,910
you'll be disobeying
orders from the North.

734
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:18,289
<i>We agreed to send you back to the North
safely in ten days, so check right now.</i>

735
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,500
You bastard! Check the instructions first!

736
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
He hung up again!

737
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,799
Stop provoking him!

738
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,261
Hello?

739
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,221
They're not answering?

740
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,516
Check them.

741
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,647
<i>It has been the basics review homework--</i>

742
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,212
"Reached an agreement with the South."

743
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,298
"Not to kill any hostages."

744
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,926
"Guaranteed to be sent back in ten days."

745
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,638
Will we really be able

746
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,891
to go back alive in ten days?

747
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,982
Last time we were ordered
to cooperate with them, we almost died.

748
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,567
-So from my point of view--
-Your point of view?

749
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,200
Since when did you start
questioning the instructions?

750
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,539
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

751
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:47,169
The failure to abduct Professor Han
is all on you.

752
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,881
And because of you,
all of our agents on our ship

753
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,676
were killed.

754
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,140
Your new mission is to go back alive

755
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,392
after keeping the hostages for ten days.

756
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,187
Making a contribution
to make up for your failure

757
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,648
is what you need to do from now on.

758
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,444
I understand.

759
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:23,497
Look.

760
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,295
You should feed the students.

761
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,590
They haven't eaten for days.

762
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,008
She's right.

763
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,552
And Mr. Kim's blood sugar is too low.

764
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,140
Let's do that.

765
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:47,855
Well, then I should
go make some rice balls.

766
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,231
What ingredients do we have?

767
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,318
Sausages and some tofu…

768
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,988
I should fry them
and cook some <i>doenjang</i> soup as well.

769
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:11,796
Go back.

770
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,964
That's good. Yeong-ro's still alive.

771
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,757
They must've listened to the instructions.

772
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,218
Then should we let the press know, sir?

773
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,636
We should tell Code 1 first.

774
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,430
Let's hurry. You know
how impatient he is. Let's go.

775
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,454
Hello?

776
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,707
Yes. And?

777
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,918
What? What are you talking about?

778
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,838
Eun Yeong-u?

779
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:39,258
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

780
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,570
Eat.

781
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,660
Aren't I just a human shield?

782
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:49,828
So why?

783
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,334
I'm not telling you to eat for your sake,

784
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,380
but for our sake.

785
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,011
Because the ANSP director's daughter
shouldn't starve to death?

786
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,143
That paper airplane…

787
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,231
Why do you have it?

788
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,533
Don't tell me

789
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:29,785
you came to the dorm

790
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,707
because of that paper airplane.

791
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:49,179
<i>Hello. This is JBC breaking news.</i>

792
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:53,434
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

793
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:57,521
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

794
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:01,483
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

795
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,820
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

796
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,031
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

797
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,450
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

798
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,869
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

799
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:15,998
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

800
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:19,376
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

801
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,005
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

802
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,423
<i>and came to Korea</i>

803
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,468
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

804
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:31,388
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

805
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,224
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

806
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,200
Cardiac arrest!

807
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,409
<i>Bring him back.</i>

808
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,120
Bring him back!

809
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,082
<i>So the ANSP director's daughter</i>

810
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,709
hid you in this dorm?

811
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:04,254
<i>But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.</i>

812
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,297
The doctor?

813
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,466
I never had any personal feelings for her.

814
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,178
We don't intend to hurt you.

815
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,807
<i>We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.</i>

816
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,268
<i>So you must know</i>

817
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,106
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

818
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,650
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

819
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,901
<i>That's a bomb, isn't it?</i>

820
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,113
Aren't they going to just kill us all?
Where's Yeong-ro?

821
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,282
<i>Let me out.</i>

822
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,709
BONUS

823
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,424
The doctor who treated you

824
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,884
is comrade Kang Cheong-ya

825
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,637
also known as Moran Hill 1.

826
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,020
Moran…

827
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,148
No. Don't get up.

828
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,317
Get better as soon as possible.

829
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,945
To go back alive in ten days.

830
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,239
Comrade.

831
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,324
Am I dreaming right now?

832
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,535
Can you pinch me?
