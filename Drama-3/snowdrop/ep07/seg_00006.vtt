00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:19.567 line:85.83%,end
We should let the press know

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.486 line:85.83%,end
about the hostage situation in the dorm.

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:23.947 line:85.83%,end
Are you crazy? Yeong-ro is in there.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.159 line:85.83%,end
If we also reveal the fact that
they have the ANSP director's daughter,

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.453 line:85.83%,end
I doubt they'll hurt our Yeong-ro.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.540 line:85.83%,end
But they already know she's my daughter.

00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:35.875 line:85.83%,end
They're still willing
to die with the hostages.

00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:39.879 line:85.83%,end
If they find out we've told the press,
they might blow themselves up.

00:30:41.464 --> 00:30:42.465 line:85.83%,end
Then we should

00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:46.636 line:85.83%,end
make the North order them
not to blow themselves up.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:49.806 line:85.83%,end
That's impossible.
They want us to send them back unscathed.

00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:52.600 line:85.83%,end
We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.103 line:85.83%,end
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.814 line:85.83%,end
just to save those expendable spies?

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:03.862 line:85.83%,end
The presidential election is in ten days.

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:06.072 line:85.83%,end
You can take care of this
after the election's won.

00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:07.782 line:85.83%,end
If we make this drag on

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.869 line:85.83%,end
and be in the news every day
up until the election,

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.872 line:85.83%,end
nobody will pay attention
to Han I-seop's case.

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:15.290 line:85.83%,end
Definitely.

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:19.210 line:85.83%,end
Hoping to fight against the Northern spies
holding the girls hostage,

00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:22.797 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure people will vote
for candidate Park Mu-yeol.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.257 line:85.83%,end
Exactly.

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.682 line:85.83%,end
I'll talk to Lim Ji-rok then.

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.269 line:85.83%,end
Withdraw the SWAT team right away.

00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:38.104 line:85.83%,end
I'll take care of that.

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:41.232 line:85.83%,end
So you go do your job.
Hurry up. We have no time to lose.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:43.902 line:85.83%,end
Hey! Get me the radio!

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.821 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, stand by. Don't do anything!

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:50.366 line:85.83%,end
<i>Anyone move a finger,
and I'll kill that bastard myself!</i>

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.915 line:85.83%,end
Get dressings ready.

00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:40.291 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.711 line:85.83%,end
Give me the gun.

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:46.339 line:85.83%,end
Now.

00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:07.860 line:85.83%,end
This is bad.

00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.321 line:85.83%,end
I totally forgot about it.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.074 line:85.83%,end
I'm supposed to meet Antonio
at Rome Coffee Shop at five.

00:33:13.866 --> 00:33:15.827 line:85.83%,end
What if he thinks I stood him up?

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:17.620 line:85.83%,end
Are you serious right now?

00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:19.163 line:85.83%,end
Antonio?

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:23.543 line:85.83%,end
What about your lovers here?

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.672 line:85.83%,end
Are you seriously worried about that now?

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:30.133 line:85.83%,end
I guess you haven't heard yet.

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:32.969 line:85.83%,end
She and Gwang-tae are through.

00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:37.056 line:85.83%,end
And she's started seeing Antonio
this month. To learn Italian.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.518 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:42.311 line:85.83%,end
The criminal law final is tomorrow.

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:44.188 line:85.83%,end
They must know
we're being held here, right?

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:45.690 line:85.83%,end
They won't hold the exam, right?

00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:54.365 line:85.83%,end
Did she just laugh? Hey.

00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:56.367 line:85.83%,end
What's so funny?

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.454 line:85.83%,end
You leech living off the tuition we pay.

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.122 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.124 line:85.83%,end
"Leech living off the tuition we pay"?

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.043 line:85.83%,end
What? Am I wrong?

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:06.669 line:85.83%,end
That's what you are.

00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:07.587 line:85.83%,end
Don't you agree?

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.921 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Polka Dot.

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.466 line:85.83%,end
Shut your trap.

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:27.190 line:85.83%,end
You confidently promised to get
300 million dollars from them in ten days.

00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:32.153 line:85.83%,end
Rescuing your son
as well as getting 300 million dollarsâ€¦

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:35.239 line:85.83%,end
Will that be really possible?

00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:47.960 line:85.83%,end
<i>Despite knowing it's impossible,</i>

00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:50.463 line:85.83%,end
<i>he's trying to buy time.</i>

00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:54.092 line:85.83%,end
<i>The almighty Lim Ji-rok is also</i>

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:56.677 line:85.83%,end
<i>just another father who loves his child.</i>
