00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.274 line:85.83%,end
He can't have surgery
until his fever breaks anyway.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:14.697 line:85.83%,end
I mean, the doctor's doing nothing, so how
about my team leader get surgery first?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.084 line:85.83%,end
He has a gunshot wound.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.170 line:85.83%,end
He needs surgery as soon as possible.

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.505 line:85.83%,end
-What's wrong with treating him while--
-Hey!

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.216 line:85.83%,end
Are you kidding?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.469 line:85.83%,end
He shot at me,
and you want us to let him get treated?

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:41.891 line:85.83%,end
Keep your word.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.810 line:85.83%,end
You promised to release hostages,
let me check the students' safety,

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.438 line:85.83%,end
and let the doctor do surgery
on my team leader.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:51.067 line:85.83%,end
I brought Dr. Kang here
because you agreed on those terms.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.823 line:85.83%,end
You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.745 line:85.83%,end
I'll kill you first if anything goes
wrong, so don't mess with me.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.801 line:85.83%,end
How is he?

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:20.638 line:85.83%,end
His temperature's still 38Â°C,
and it's not going down.

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.418 line:85.83%,end
It's because the infection caused
a high white blood cell count.

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:53.587 line:85.83%,end
I gave him a fever reducer,
so it'll go down in two to three hours.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.513 line:85.83%,end
<i>SWAT team breaking in soon.</i>

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:04.348 line:85.83%,end
<i>The whole dorm is being wiretapped.</i>

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.779 line:85.83%,end
Then why don't you treat
their team leader until then?

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.073 line:85.83%,end
I think that's better as well.

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.875 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP team leader
will be treated first.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.501 line:85.83%,end
Comrade.

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:39.425 line:85.83%,end
Treat him? We should be killing him.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.639 line:85.83%,end
For now, it's most important
to maintain mutual trust.

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.185 line:85.83%,end
<i>Trust?</i>

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.271 line:85.83%,end
Their goal is killing us.
How can we trust them?

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:58.110 line:85.83%,end
Just keep an eye on the hostages.
That's your job.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.323 line:85.83%,end
Especially those by the windows.

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.249 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you say
there was no problem with her?

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.628 line:85.83%,end
Yes, according to
all those weekly reports!

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.547 line:85.83%,end
That damn Pi.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.841 line:85.83%,end
She even went through
water and electric torture.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.718 line:85.83%,end
How dare she stab me in the back?

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.364 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.491 line:85.83%,end
I got to say,

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.743 line:85.83%,end
you are indeed a liability.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.037 line:85.83%,end
A liability to us.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.624 line:85.83%,end
Even your child
has become a liability now.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:37.459 line:85.83%,end
Unbelievable.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:39.086 line:85.83%,end
Oh, right.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.880 line:85.83%,end
-Hey, An.
-Yes, sir.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:45.467 line:85.83%,end
Does hiding a communist spy
count as espionage?

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:49.972 line:85.83%,end
To be precise,
it's aiding and abetting espionage.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.807 line:85.83%,end
My God.

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.058 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP director

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.895 line:85.83%,end
should be in the vanguard
of anti-communism and counterespionage.

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:57.980 line:85.83%,end
You're a disgrace to our country.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.773 line:85.83%,end
Don't you think?

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.406 line:85.83%,end
I was just kidding.
