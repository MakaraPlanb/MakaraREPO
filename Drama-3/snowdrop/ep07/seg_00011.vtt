00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:04.814 line:85.83%,end
But it's not working.

00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:06.941 line:85.83%,end
Listen carefully.

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:10.862 line:85.83%,end
I'll pick a hostage at random
and kill them in ten minutes.

00:58:11.905 --> 00:58:12.780 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:16.659 line:85.83%,end
And that student's death
will be all on you.

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.621 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:20.955 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:58:21.956 --> 00:58:23.041 line:85.83%,end
Turn the volume up!

00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:24.584 line:85.83%,end
Turn it up!

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:27.045 line:85.83%,end
"Student"? He definitely said student.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.239 line:85.83%,end
Are you really going to kill them?

00:58:58.576 --> 00:58:59.619 line:85.83%,end
I should.

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.955 line:85.83%,end
Who do you think we should kill?

00:59:06.751 --> 00:59:08.711 line:85.83%,end
<i>The one who called us communist bastards…</i>

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:12.423 line:85.83%,end
Shouldn't we kill that one first?

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:15.969 line:85.83%,end
So you're saying
we should kill Eun Yeong-ro first, right?

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.226 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:59:24.686 --> 00:59:25.770 line:85.83%,end
Kill her.

00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.297 line:85.83%,end
It's not working, is it?

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.381 line:85.83%,end
Why can't I hear anything?

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.634 line:85.83%,end
The wiretapping in Area 2-4 is cut off.

00:59:57.343 --> 00:59:58.469 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.060 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro's
the daughter of the ANSP director.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.567 line:85.83%,end
Which means she's our lifeline.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.160 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Area 2-4…</i>
-Area 2-2 is cut off.

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:23.828 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Can any sniper see her?</i>
-What?

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:25.538 line:85.83%,end
<i>I repeat. Area 2-4--</i>

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.968 line:85.83%,end
-Hey, An!
-Yes, sir.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.428 line:85.83%,end
One moment, sir.

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:42.013 line:85.83%,end
Area 2-3 is not working as well!

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:42.930 line:85.83%,end
Forget that.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.266 line:85.83%,end
Area 1-1 is not working as well!

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.935 line:85.83%,end
Don't just say that!
Find the ones still working!

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:49.312 line:85.83%,end
Check if there's any working!

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:50.313 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.985 line:85.83%,end
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:19.634 line:85.83%,end
Please.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.472 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:31.646 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.632 line:85.83%,end
I got rid of all the bugs.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.593 line:85.83%,end
You can talk freely now.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:45.970 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.236 line:85.83%,end
<i>Lim Soo-ho?</i>

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.405 line:85.83%,end
<i>This is the ANSP director.</i>
