That's good. Yeong-ro's still alive.

01:08:55.047 --> 01:08:56.757 line:85.83%,end
They must've listened to the instructions.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.218 line:85.83%,end
Then should we let the press know, sir?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.636 line:85.83%,end
We should tell Code 1 first.

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.430 line:85.83%,end
Let's hurry. You know
how impatient he is. Let's go.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.454 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

01:09:28.455 --> 01:09:29.707 line:85.83%,end
Yes. And?

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.918 line:85.83%,end
What? What are you talking about?

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.838 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-u?

01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:39.258 line:85.83%,end
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.570 line:85.83%,end
Eat.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.660 line:85.83%,end
Aren't I just a human shield?

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:49.828 line:85.83%,end
So why?

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:55.334 line:85.83%,end
I'm not telling you to eat for your sake,

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.380 line:85.83%,end
but for our sake.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.011 line:85.83%,end
Because the ANSP director's daughter
shouldn't starve to death?

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.143 line:85.83%,end
That paper airplane…

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.231 line:85.83%,end
Why do you have it?

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.533 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:29.785 line:85.83%,end
you came to the dorm

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.707 line:85.83%,end
because of that paper airplane.

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:19.376 line:85.83%,end
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.005 line:85.83%,end
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.423 line:85.83%,end
<i>and came to Korea</i>

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:27.468 line:85.83%,end

Bring him back!

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:58.082 line:85.83%,end
<i>So the ANSP director's daughter</i>

01:12:58.582 --> 01:13:00.709 line:85.83%,end
hid you in this dorm?

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:04.254 line:85.83%,end
<i>But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.</i>

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:05.297 line:85.83%,end
The doctor?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.466 line:85.83%,end
I never had any personal feelings for her.

<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:25.901 line:14.17%,start
<i>That's a bomb, isn't it?</i>

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:29.113 line:14.17%,start
Aren't they going to just kill us all?
Where's Yeong-ro?

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:32.282 line:14.17%,start
<i>Let me out.</i>
