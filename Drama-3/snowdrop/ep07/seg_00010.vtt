00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.054 line:85.83%,end
Take your hands off the door.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:06.474 line:85.83%,end
The SWAT team is standing by outside.

00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:10.312 line:85.83%,end
Take your hands off it
if you want to live.

00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:25.785 line:85.83%,end
Even if you shoot me, they'll break in
since I disabled the booby trap.

00:53:29.623 --> 00:53:31.041 line:85.83%,end
You know what this is, right?

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:40.133 line:85.83%,end
If I push this button, you and I,
as well as the hostages, will all die.

00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:47.599 line:85.83%,end
You want to save your team leader,

00:53:48.975 --> 00:53:50.185 line:85.83%,end
don't you?

00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:54.648 line:85.83%,end
He even got shot to protect you.

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.864 line:85.83%,end
If you want to save him,

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:05.367 line:85.83%,end
go out and stop the SWAT team.

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:18.171 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in! Now!

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:19.631 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in!

00:54:22.717 --> 00:54:24.135 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in!

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:34.896 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, go in! You bastards!

00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:43.530 line:85.83%,end
<i>Hey, are you sure
the wiretapping is working?</i>

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:45.865 line:85.83%,end
Why can't I hear anything?
Turn the volume up!

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.033 line:85.83%,end
Turn it up!

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.708 line:85.83%,end
Turn it up, you idiots! God damn it!

00:54:57.252 --> 00:54:59.296 line:85.83%,end
Eun, how did it go?

00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.630 line:85.83%,end
Did you talk to them?

00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:04.592 line:85.83%,end
See? I told you.

00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:10.432 line:85.83%,end
In any case, I'm worried how much more
Lim Ji-rok will demand this time.

00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:12.017 line:85.83%,end
He's not in charge anymore.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.227 line:85.83%,end
We negotiate with Choi Su-ryeon now.

00:55:14.894 --> 00:55:16.438 line:85.83%,end
What? Why?

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.232 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:21.776 line:85.83%,end
Why are we not sending the SWAT team in?

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.029 line:85.83%,end
We must send them in!

00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:25.196 line:85.83%,end
How dare you--

00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:30.869 line:85.83%,end
It's me.

00:55:30.952 --> 00:55:33.455 line:85.83%,end
You said you'd send us
back to the North safely,

00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:36.082 line:85.83%,end
but you're sending the SWAT team in?

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.335 line:85.83%,end
Sending the SWAT team in?

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:41.880 line:85.83%,end
Hey! It's all a lie!
Our agent lied to you!

00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.341 line:85.83%,end
She lied to make you surrender!

00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:45.342 line:85.83%,end
Give it!

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:48.762 line:85.83%,end
<i>Listen. First, let Cheong-- No.</i>

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:49.888 line:85.83%,end
Let the doctor out.

00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:53.099 line:85.83%,end
Let Dr. Kang out right now, you bastard!

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:59.773 line:85.83%,end
How did you find out your agent talked
about the SWAT team in the tent?

00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:07.364 line:85.83%,end
He wants to talk to you.

00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:11.242 line:85.83%,end
The hostages' lives are
at stake, but what?

00:56:11.826 --> 00:56:13.119 line:85.83%,end
It's all a lie?

00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:14.788 line:85.83%,end
Seriously?

00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:16.956 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.416 line:85.83%,end
Get her out of here!

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.960 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir. Come out here.

00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:23.171 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Choi.

00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:25.090 line:85.83%,end
Come here.

00:56:25.673 --> 00:56:26.591 line:85.83%,end
Let go of me!

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.433 line:85.83%,end
There must've been

00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:37.852 line:85.83%,end
<i>a misunderstanding.
We didn't try to send them in.</i>

00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:40.563 line:85.83%,end
-We just wanted to send you back--
<i>-No.</i>

00:56:41.272 --> 00:56:44.192 line:85.83%,end
I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.

00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:50.949 line:85.83%,end
If you don't believe me,
check with the North.

00:56:51.032 --> 00:56:52.450 line:85.83%,end
Check the instructions.

00:56:54.285 --> 00:56:57.914 line:85.83%,end
You tell me to check the instructions
whenever you're cornered.

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:02.544 line:85.83%,end
Last time we followed the instructions,
we got shot at upon getting out.

00:57:02.627 --> 00:57:06.005 line:85.83%,end
That was because of the engagement
on the West Sea. I told you!

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:07.549 line:85.83%,end
Does the leadership in the North

00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:11.010 line:85.83%,end
know that you tried to kill us?

00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:15.515 line:85.83%,end
They do know all three of you are alive.

00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:21.104 line:85.83%,end
Seeing how you know our rendezvous point

00:57:21.729 --> 00:57:24.441 line:85.83%,end
and the goal of this mission well,

00:57:25.024 --> 00:57:27.527 line:85.83%,end
you must be in close liaison
with the leadership in the North.

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.783 line:85.83%,end
What kind of deal did you make?

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.996 line:85.83%,end
<i>You'd better be honest with me.</i>

00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:42.167 line:85.83%,end
Your daughter's in my hands.

00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:44.544 line:85.83%,end
You know that, right?

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.300 line:85.83%,end
<i>You are</i>

00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:53.928 line:85.83%,end
a spy who must obey
orders from your country.

00:57:54.512 --> 00:57:56.890 line:85.83%,end
<i>So check the instructions right now!</i>

00:58:00.018 --> 00:58:03.271 line:85.83%,end
I wanted us to talk it out
before I make you pay for fooling us.
