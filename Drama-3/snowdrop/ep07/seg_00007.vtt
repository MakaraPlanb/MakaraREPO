Lim Ji-rok speaking.

00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:21.702 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lim.

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:25.581 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry about last time. I apologize.

00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:27.166 line:85.83%,end
It was so urgent that--

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.085 line:85.83%,end
<i>When on earth are you going to send</i>

00:35:29.168 --> 00:35:31.379 line:85.83%,end
our agents in the dorm back to us?

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.882 line:85.83%,end
It's been exposed that Han was abducted

00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:37.176 line:85.83%,end
and not defecting to the North.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.138 line:85.83%,end
So Aemin Party is
in a tough spot right now.

00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.181 line:85.83%,end
That's your problem.

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:45.518 line:85.83%,end
Send our agents
back to the North right away!

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:47.270 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:49.272 line:85.83%,end
but we have no choice but to make

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.190 line:85.83%,end
the hostage situation public.

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:52.775 line:85.83%,end
<i>What?</i>

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:54.443 line:85.83%,end
The hostage situation?

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:02.326 line:85.83%,end
What on earth is your big plan
you want to carry out?

00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:05.163 line:85.83%,end
As for the spies, how about we kill

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.165 line:85.83%,end
all three?

00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:08.416 line:85.83%,end
Kill all three?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.586 line:85.83%,end
Are you seriously
thinking of killing them all?

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.463 line:85.83%,end
Sir, it's just three spies.
If you sacrifice them,

00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:16.507 line:85.83%,end
you'll get 300 million dollars.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.926 line:85.83%,end
Just three spies?

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.221 line:85.83%,end
<i>Send our agents back to us unscathed!</i>

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:24.724 line:85.83%,end
Send them back right away! If you don't,

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.767 line:85.83%,end
there will be war! You hear me?

00:36:28.769 --> 00:36:29.812 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.238 line:85.83%,end
Yeon-hwa!

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.951 line:85.83%,end
Send them a message

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.370 line:85.83%,end
that they must come back alive! Now!

00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:48.039 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:36:48.122 --> 00:36:48.998 line:85.83%,end
Anyway,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.418 line:85.83%,end
the Secretary's Office wants
to see you right now.

00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:54.837 line:85.83%,end
Right now?

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:14.232 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lim?

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:18.611 line:85.83%,end
This is Choi Su-ryeon,
the deputy director of MSS.

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:20.780 line:85.83%,end
I see.

00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:23.074 line:85.83%,end
You'll have to negotiate with me
from now on.

00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:26.410 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm sure</i>

00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:29.288 line:85.83%,end
our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:33.292 line:85.83%,end
Kill them.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:09.537 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Choi Su-ryeon just told
the South to kill all of our spies.

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:31.142 line:14.17%,start
STOP
SECURITY CHECKPOINT

00:38:35.062 --> 00:38:36.814 line:14.17%,start
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:38.024 line:14.17%,start
What's going on?

00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.239 line:85.83%,end
You did well.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.538 line:85.83%,end
Could you put the rifle away?

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.874 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know
about the Geneva Conventions?

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:59.003 line:85.83%,end
Even during war, you can't attack any
of your enemy's medical staff or hospitals

00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:00.713 line:85.83%,end
that wounded soldiers are in.

00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:12.350 line:85.83%,end
What did you do to him?
Why isn't he waking up?

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:15.102 line:85.83%,end
Midazolam is

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.689 line:85.83%,end
a sedative you use before surgery.

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:22.610 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.912 line:85.83%,end
Stand up.

00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:01.107 line:85.83%,end
Look. How could you suspect the doctor?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.193 line:85.83%,end
If they wanted to kill you,
they wouldn't have sent in a doctor,

00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:05.694 line:85.83%,end
but an armed agent.
