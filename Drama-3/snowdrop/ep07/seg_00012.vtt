01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.539 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo Gyeok-chan.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.420 line:85.83%,end
You were fearless and worthy of the Order
of Military Service Honor you got.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:26.219 line:85.83%,end
I was instructed to come here
to send you back to the North safely.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.972 line:85.83%,end
I'm Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:35.269 line:85.83%,end
And I'm also known as Moran Hill 1
in our country.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:39.565 line:85.83%,end
Moran Hill…

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.986 line:85.83%,end
The one awarded the Hero of the Republic?

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.285 line:85.83%,end
I apologize. I should have recognized you.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:54.205 line:85.83%,end
I provoked you on purpose
to fool the others,

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:55.248 line:85.83%,end
so don't worry.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:59.168 line:85.83%,end
<i>Lim Soo-ho! Can you hear me?</i>

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:11.389 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho. You and I may

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:15.309 line:85.83%,end
believe in different things in different
situations, but we want the same thing.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.311 line:85.83%,end
You want your men's safety,

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.479 line:85.83%,end
and I want

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:21.274 line:85.83%,end
the hostages' safety.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:22.859 line:85.83%,end
Now,

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:26.195 line:85.83%,end
<i>the director of the Agency
for National Security Planning</i>

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:29.282 line:85.83%,end
<i>desperately wants to talk with you.</i>

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.619 line:85.83%,end
Pick up the phone!

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.371 line:85.83%,end
You can hear me, right?

01:04:35.454 --> 01:04:38.207 line:85.83%,end
Let's talk it out! Please!

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.168 line:85.83%,end
-Those bastards.
<i>-Lim Soo-ho!</i>

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.838 line:85.83%,end
They wiretapped us, and what? Talk it out?

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.382 line:85.83%,end
They can hear me, right?

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:50.469 line:85.83%,end
Actually, the ANSP director told me
to check the party's instructions,

01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:53.764 line:85.83%,end
so I took you here to check them with you.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.529 line:85.83%,end
<i>Lim Soo-ho.</i>

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.490 line:85.83%,end
If you kill any of the students,

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.910 line:85.83%,end
you'll be disobeying
orders from the North.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:18.289 line:85.83%,end
<i>We agreed to send you back to the North
safely in ten days, so check right now.</i>

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:21.500 line:85.83%,end
You bastard! Check the instructions first!

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.256 line:85.83%,end
He hung up again!

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.799 line:85.83%,end
Stop provoking him!

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.261 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:34.221 line:85.83%,end
They're not answering?

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.516 line:85.83%,end
Check them.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:42.647 line:85.83%,end
<i>It has been the basics review homework--</i>

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.212 line:85.83%,end
"Reached an agreement with the South."

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.298 line:85.83%,end
"Not to kill any hostages."

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.926 line:85.83%,end
"Guaranteed to be sent back in ten days."

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.638 line:85.83%,end
Will we really be able

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:18.891 line:85.83%,end
to go back alive in ten days?

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:25.982 line:85.83%,end
Last time we were ordered
to cooperate with them, we almost died.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.567 line:85.83%,end
-So from my point of view--
-Your point of view?

01:06:33.197 --> 01:06:36.200 line:85.83%,end
Since when did you start
questioning the instructions?

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:41.539 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:47.169 line:85.83%,end
The failure to abduct Professor Han
is all on you.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.881 line:85.83%,end
And because of you,
all of our agents on our ship

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:53.676 line:85.83%,end
were killed.

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:59.140 line:85.83%,end
Your new mission is to go back alive

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:01.392 line:85.83%,end
after keeping the hostages for ten days.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.187 line:85.83%,end
Making a contribution
to make up for your failure

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.648 line:85.83%,end
is what you need to do from now on.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:11.444 line:85.83%,end
I understand.

01:07:22.663 --> 01:07:23.497 line:85.83%,end
Look.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:29.295 line:85.83%,end
You should feed the students.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:32.590 line:85.83%,end
They haven't eaten for days.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.008 line:85.83%,end
She's right.

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.552 line:85.83%,end
And Mr. Kim's blood sugar is too low.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.140 line:85.83%,end
Let's do that.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:47.855 line:85.83%,end
Well, then I should
go make some rice balls.

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:49.231 line:85.83%,end
What ingredients do we have?

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:52.318 line:85.83%,end
Sausages and some tofu…

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:55.988 line:85.83%,end
I should fry them
and cook some <i>doenjang</i> soup as well.

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:11.796 line:85.83%,end
Go back.
