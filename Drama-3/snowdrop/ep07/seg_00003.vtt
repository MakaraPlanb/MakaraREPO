00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.414 line:85.83%,end
<i>By the way, ma'am,</i>

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.709 line:85.83%,end
I know he said
it should be 13 young virgins,

00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:20.836 line:85.83%,end
but does it have to be exactly 13?

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.634 line:85.83%,end
As a matter of fact,

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:30.304 line:85.83%,end
I was dying to know about that all night,

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:34.058 line:85.83%,end
so I called the fortuneteller
first thing in the morning.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.314 line:85.83%,end
What did he say?

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.609 line:85.83%,end
He said it should be

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:45.277 line:85.83%,end
exactly 13 virgins.

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:47.404 line:85.83%,end
No more, no less.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:49.198 line:85.83%,end
Exactly 13.

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.493 line:85.83%,end
Then it's very unlikely.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.164 line:85.83%,end
I mean, how will the spies kill

00:15:57.247 --> 00:16:00.292 line:85.83%,end
exactly 13 as if they know about it?

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:04.129 line:85.83%,end
There are more than 70 hostages
in the dorm.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.756 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.549 line:85.83%,end
That many?

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.592 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:09.760 line:85.83%,end
That reminds me.

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:12.638 line:85.83%,end
They're supposed to release
some of the hostages today.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.724 line:85.83%,end
Release?

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.102 line:85.83%,end
How many?

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:21.939 line:85.83%,end
Well, as many as the spies want, I guess.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.734 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I guess so.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.122 line:85.83%,end
What kind of man is
Eun Chang-su, the ANSP director?

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:28.047 line:85.83%,end
Do you want me

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.507 line:85.83%,end
to brief you on my boss?

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.384 line:85.83%,end
<i>Brief a Northern spy?</i>

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:35.512 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm holding tens of students hostage,</i>

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.306 line:85.83%,end
<i>yet he's fooled me twice.</i>

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.683 line:85.83%,end
Is he foolish enough
to try to fool me again?

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.686 line:85.83%,end
<i>Was Cheong-ya caught?</i>

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.938 line:85.83%,end
<i>Was Han-na caught?</i>

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.149 line:85.83%,end
<i>The ANSP director is
dealing with you himself?</i>

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.693 line:85.83%,end
<i>A mere Northern spy like you?</i>

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.612 line:85.83%,end
The director himself?

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.322 line:85.83%,end
His daughter is being held hostage,

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.992 line:85.83%,end
so I'm sure he ran over in a rush.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.328 line:85.83%,end
<i>The director's daughter?</i>

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:11.757 line:85.83%,end
The whole building is
rigged with C4 bombs,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.759 line:85.83%,end
from basement two to the third floor.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:17.054 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you try to deceive me again,</i>

00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:19.473 line:85.83%,end
<i>the bombs will go off all at once.</i>

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.643 line:85.83%,end
Check if it's true.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:25.979 line:85.83%,end
If I push this button,

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.023 line:85.83%,end
you, I,

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.526 line:85.83%,end
and the 70 hostages

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.403 line:85.83%,end
will all die.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.864 line:85.83%,end
Then

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.033 line:85.83%,end
Director Eun Chang-su

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.286 line:85.83%,end
<i>won't even find his daughter's body.</i>

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:45.916 line:85.83%,end
How dare that bastard
threaten him like that?

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.045 line:85.83%,end
Wait, Eun.

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.464 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me you believe that bulls***.

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.632 line:85.83%,end
I should.

00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:55.884 line:85.83%,end
If the bombs explode
and the students get killed,

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:56.927 line:85.83%,end
what will you do?

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.638 line:85.83%,end
<i>You'll blow yourself and your men up?</i>

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.017 line:85.83%,end
Aren't you their leader?

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:06.311 line:85.83%,end
Is Geum-cheol's death not enough?

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.313 line:85.83%,end
Are you going
to lead the rest to death too?

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.026 line:85.83%,end
I'll do anything for my men's honor.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.613 line:85.83%,end
I won't let them die as traitors.

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.200 line:85.83%,end
I'd rather blow ourselves up

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.953 line:85.83%,end
to die heroes for my country.

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.672 line:85.83%,end
What is this?

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.465 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:38.218 line:85.83%,end
what he just said is scaring you.

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:40.095 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.766 line:85.83%,end
You're too chicken to serve the country.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.685 line:85.83%,end
We can just get them all at once

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.146 line:85.83%,end
before they blow themselves up.

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.690 line:85.83%,end
Get them all at once? How?

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:55.986 line:85.83%,end
I knew this might happen,
so I already put another plan into action.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:03.827 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang will knock out two
of the communist spies with injections,

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.329 line:85.83%,end
so all you need to do

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:08.081 line:85.83%,end
is get rid of the booby traps
on basement two.

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:12.169 line:85.83%,end
Then our SWAT team
will go in secretly and kill

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.713 line:85.83%,end
the last one.
