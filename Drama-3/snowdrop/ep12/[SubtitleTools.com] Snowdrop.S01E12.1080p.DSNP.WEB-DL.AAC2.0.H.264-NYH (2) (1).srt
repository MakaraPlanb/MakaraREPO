EPISODE 12

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,776
ON AIR

4
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,945
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,155
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,449
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,826
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,285
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,578
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,580
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,582
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,168
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,194
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:33,594
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,262
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:37,473
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,684
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,646
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,949
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,874
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:07,044
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,883
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,803
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:24,353
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,858
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,611
As I thought…

28
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:08,702
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:19,212
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,519
kill me now.

31
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,734
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,155
is your father?

33
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:08,470
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,888
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,563
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,905
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:30,450
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,869
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:35,914
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,796
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,382
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,355
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,904
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:10,490
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:15,620
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,457
Do you believe

47
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,043
your life is yours?

48
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:33,221
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,141
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:39,561
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:44,941
Tonight,

52
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:48,403
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:52,574
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,205
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,500
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,460
Now that…

57
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,803
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,559
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,901
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,071
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,838
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:51,841
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:55,470
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,559
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,937
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,438
I'm just saying

67
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:08,567
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,528
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,655
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:17,200
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:23,039
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,500
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,920
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:32,757
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,386
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,596
An!

77
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,061
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:50,150
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,069
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,865
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,284
All right, sir.

82
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:03,747
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,664
Hey!

84
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:13,214
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:18,303
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,931
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:24,309
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:28,980
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:33,109
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:38,198
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:42,369
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,829
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:50,168
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,547
He got a message?

95
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:57,634
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,599
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,812
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,073
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:21,783
When he came out,

100
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,160
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,997
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:31,418
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,545
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:35,422
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,090
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:40,468
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,304
That reminds me.

108
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:46,057
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,851
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:51,354
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,440
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:54,357
When was it?

113
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:57,902
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,822
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,241
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:06,995
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,413
What do you think?

118
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,624
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,710
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,462
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,547
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,007
Blow them up?

123
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,509
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,386
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,514
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,517
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,352
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,897
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,107
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,942
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,111
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:44,073
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:49,287
Hey.

134
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,141
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,103
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,667
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,093
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,264
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,310
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,313
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,693
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,070
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,825
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:15,540
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:20,169
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,630
Protect me?

147
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:27,385
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,262
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,685
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,440
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,860
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,613
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:48,990
Understand?

154
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:30,114
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,950
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,869
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,664
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:41,167
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,170
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:47,090
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:48,633
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,218
Well…

163
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:55,390
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,684
a gun at me.

165
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,852
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:04,357
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,696
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:14,242
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:15,660
Maybe…

170
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:20,248
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,165
Hey.

172
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,001
Come on.

173
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,377
What?

174
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:29,382
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,551
made them think it was love

176
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,469
and kiss.

177
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,138
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:37,807
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,309
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,646
By the way,

181
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,649
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,153
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,529
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:54,490
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:55,825
to win the election.

186
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,119
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:00,830
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:08,171
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:12,341
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:15,928
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,931
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,475
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:29,734
I'm fine.

194
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,321
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:40,411
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:42,205
Are you serious?

197
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:44,332
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,294
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,338
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,423
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,008
Gosh…

202
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,579
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,935
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,523
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,862
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:42,533
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,786
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,146
I promise

209
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,608
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,534
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,371
will be all right.

212
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,252
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:38,506
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:40,049
Right?

215
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,766
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,228
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:01,112
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,167
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:48,576
Charlotte?

220
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,124
Look who's here.

221
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:00,004
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:03,966
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,218
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:09,889
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:14,310
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:19,357
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:24,695
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,366
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,826
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,372
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:40,503
Oh, right.

232
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,299
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:54,266
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:59,188
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:03,109
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:09,156
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,577
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,996
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,124
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:20,251
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:24,088
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,216
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,384
Oh, my.

244
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,514
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,102
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:41,689
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,529
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,538
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:00,166
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,461
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:04,753 --> 00:26:08,340
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:11,427
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:15,097
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,203
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:40,372
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,958
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:46,795
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,383
Let's see…

259
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:06,857
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:08,984
There's only one question,

261
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,153
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,863
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:22,665
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,461
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,047
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,135
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,178
Hey!

268
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:41,600
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:50,651
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,738
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,173
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,261
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:18,846
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:24,977
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,812
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,692
The deity always

277
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:34,653
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:40,451
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:43,454
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,247
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,791
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:07,436
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:19,865
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:27,456
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:32,419
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:35,214
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:40,135
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:43,972
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,397
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,649
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,152
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:00,072
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,842
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:22,428
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,348
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:28,517
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:32,020
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:36,567
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,404
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,114
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:45,743
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:46,660
Wait.

303
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:50,497
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,753
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:58,297
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:00,132
Arrest her.

307
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:01,216
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,432
Come here.

309
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:10,976
Now.

310
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:36,919
What's up?

311
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:39,338
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:40,506
Me?

313
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:43,759
For what?

314
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:47,638
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,768
All right.

316
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:07,032
Start the car!

317
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:15,082
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,251
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,920
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:22,130
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:36,854
Hey.

322
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,773
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,484
What?

324
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,319
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:46,738
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:50,409
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:54,079
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:00,335
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,545
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,339
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,888
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:20,272
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:23,400
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:27,279
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,072
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,991
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:33,869
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:38,498
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,880
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:48,216
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,847
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:57,017
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,146
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:03,774
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:14,076
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:18,789
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,333
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,544
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,755
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:29,800
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,802
You bastards.

352
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,429
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,183
Explosives?

354
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:45,524
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:49,611
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:53,532
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:57,327
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,454
You bastards!

359
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,334
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:07,295
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,299
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:15,512
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:16,430
One more thing.

364
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:21,518
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:24,521
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:26,898
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:36,033
What?

368
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,326
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:43,248
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:51,006
We need to talk.

371
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:56,845
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:58,388
What?

373
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,601
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:05,812
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:08,023
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:12,402
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:15,530
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,408
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,160
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,954
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:24,623
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:30,629
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,008
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,635
Okay.

385
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:39,012
All right.

386
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,731
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:28,687
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,151
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,987
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,199
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,827
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,497
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:53,211
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:55,088
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:01,469
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:03,972
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:26,661
Hey.

398
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,625
Hey!

399
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:38,089
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:39,633
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:43,428
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:45,555
Stop!

403
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,183
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:50,435
There must be something here.

405
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:53,647
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,981
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,651
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,070
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:02,239
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:05,033
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:05,116 --> 00:39:07,953
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:10,538
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:12,207
I am not.

414
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,042
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,335
Escape?

416
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:19,005
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:25,262
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,097
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,683
I repeat.

420
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:30,976
Everyone

421
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,227
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,979
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:36,481
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,695
Wait!

425
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:48,910
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:52,289
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,833
My goodness.

428
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,335
What is it this time?

429
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,587
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:03,383
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,219
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:10,140
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:16,146
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:32,454 --> 00:40:34,122
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,753
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:46,009
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:49,596
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,931
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:55,268
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:57,979
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:00,899
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,113
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,621
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,212
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:24,839
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:35,016
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:41,731
Why are you

448
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:46,111
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:49,406
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:57,831
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,124
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,878
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:08,049
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:10,927
I don't…

455
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,473
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,895
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:23,940
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,611
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:29,779
I'll go back.

460
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:33,366
What?

461
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,118
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,290
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:42,167
Are you insane?

464
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:44,878
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,504
If I go back,

466
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,426
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,900
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:12,405 --> 00:43:15,450
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:16,743 --> 00:43:17,827
Wait.

470
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:20,330
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,419
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,922
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,590
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,634
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:35,512
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:37,055
In the restroom?

477
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:39,307
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,237
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,740
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:58,535
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,579
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:04,457
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,512
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:21,683
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:23,393
You don't think?

486
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:25,311
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:29,649
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:31,609
To be honest,

489
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:34,070
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:38,866
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,578
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:42,453 --> 00:44:44,497
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,125
but she did not.

494
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,502
What about your side?

495
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:56,092
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:00,013
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:50,146
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,077
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:06,329
Last night,

500
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:08,081
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:13,252
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:14,796
I can't.

503
00:46:15,922 --> 00:46:18,466
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:20,343
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:22,053
Come out here.

506
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:24,472
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:27,225
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:34,232 --> 00:46:36,859
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:40,321
Ma'am.

510
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,755
Just a bite.

511
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:02,176
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,469
Put that away.

513
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,682
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:13,104
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:18,526
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:23,281
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:25,992
You can hear now.

518
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:31,289
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,960
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:37,962
so we're done for.

521
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,429
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:47,263 --> 00:47:48,723
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:51,392
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:51,476 --> 00:47:53,978
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:55,188
He will.

526
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:59,692
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,237
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,239
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:07,200
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,433
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:39,524 --> 00:48:40,650
Damn it.

532
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:56,541
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:58,042 --> 00:48:59,377
Please--

534
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:09,136
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,890
This is your last task.

536
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:16,561
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:18,479
Kill them all!

538
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:22,483
Only ten of you

539
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:25,862
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:37,415
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,688
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:21,500
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:23,210
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,762
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:33,804 --> 00:50:34,889
Attack him!

546
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,532
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:56,327
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:00,915 --> 00:51:02,458
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:13,594
You little bastard.

550
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:17,056
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:26,107
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:29,819
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:31,404
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,866
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:41,831
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:44,959
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:46,127
The party…

558
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:51,674
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:54,927
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:57,596
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:58,305 --> 00:51:59,890
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:06,313
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:18,117 --> 00:52:19,660
Ever since then,

564
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:24,165
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:25,708
Then

566
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,003
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:32,673
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:33,674 --> 00:52:35,342
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,344
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:40,639
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:42,767
Remember.

572
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,352
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:49,231
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:51,442
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:54,862
kill him.

576
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:58,115
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:01,077
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:03,704
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:07,291
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:28,854
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:34,985
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:38,697
Don't worry.

583
00:53:40,032 --> 00:53:42,076
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,995
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:49,250
You told the party?

586
00:53:52,211 --> 00:53:53,963
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,550
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,302
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:03,139
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:14,316
Our plan

591
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:18,320
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:20,322
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:24,618
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:27,413
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,166
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:31,500
Sit down.

597
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,629
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:39,842
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:44,763
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:48,976
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:50,144 --> 00:54:51,395
From now on,

602
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:52,897
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:55,441
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:58,611
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:00,779
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,364
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:02,448 --> 00:55:04,909
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:06,160
I told you.

609
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:07,536
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,747
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,790
I have that radio.

612
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:15,085
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,591
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:24,386
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:26,847
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:29,308
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:30,643
Hey.

618
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:33,229
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:35,356
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:37,399
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:42,696
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:45,783
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:49,828
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,581
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:54,792
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,629
Quiet.

627
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,422
Quiet!

628
00:56:02,132 --> 00:56:03,425
Hold on.

629
00:56:04,134 --> 00:56:06,804
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:10,432
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:12,101
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:12,685 --> 00:56:13,936
Is this why?

633
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,065
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:21,026
is all true.

635
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:24,530
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:24,613 --> 00:56:25,948
What?

637
00:56:26,031 --> 00:56:27,408
So it's true?

638
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:30,828
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:35,124
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,251
Wiretap?

641
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:38,877
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:40,838
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:44,216
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:49,138
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:50,264 --> 00:56:51,265
I'm sure…

646
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:56,687
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:57,688 --> 00:56:58,939
I see.

648
00:56:59,023 --> 00:57:01,400
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:03,193
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,154
Was it?

651
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:07,114
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:09,742
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:13,412
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,125
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:24,840
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:35,309
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:39,063
One more step forward,

658
00:57:40,522 --> 00:57:42,649
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:50,949
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:53,952
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:56,997 --> 00:57:58,165
She is not!

662
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,381
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:08,050
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:11,845
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:17,101
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:20,104
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:22,898
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:22,981 --> 00:58:24,233
That damn b****.

669
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:26,318
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:27,778 --> 00:58:30,739
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:33,659
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:35,577
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:37,621
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:39,623
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:37,931
This money…

676
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:39,933
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:42,436
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:44,855
and use her

679
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:47,316
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:53,030
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:54,281 --> 00:59:57,493
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,872
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:04,249
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:07,920
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:10,756
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:17,971
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:20,849
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:26,230
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:28,815
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,613
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:37,991
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:41,495
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:41,578 --> 01:00:43,705
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:47,834
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:52,631
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:57,427
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:57,511 --> 01:00:58,929
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:08,272
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:14,236
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:17,155 --> 01:01:20,742
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:23,954
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:39,928
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:44,474
December 3.

704
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:46,768
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:49,605
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:51,356 --> 01:01:53,400
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:58,238
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:00,365
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,958
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:13,045
On December 5.

711
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:15,797
What?

712
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:18,550
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,886
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:26,683 --> 01:02:28,518
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:28,602 --> 01:02:30,062
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:38,028
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:39,738
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:41,323
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:45,786
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:48,705
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,627
Is this bastard

722
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,255
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:57,339 --> 01:03:01,134
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:04,513
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:06,973
Su-hui?

726
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,519
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:10,602 --> 01:03:13,397
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,024
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:21,446
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:27,994
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:28,662 --> 01:03:32,082
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:32,165 --> 01:03:33,417
We should.

733
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:37,963
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:41,967
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:45,303
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:48,974
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:51,393
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,895
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,856
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:57,524
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:57,607 --> 01:03:59,443
I said one sentence.

742
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:01,403
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:01,486 --> 01:04:02,612
Among us?

744
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:22,924
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:23,008 --> 01:04:25,677
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:29,306 --> 01:04:32,184
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:34,561
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:00,545
Anything unusual?

749
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:01,963
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:04,341
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:06,092
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,720
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,223
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,183
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:18,730
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,567
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,153
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:38,560
Hello?

759
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:47,736
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:52,991
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:57,454 --> 01:06:59,956
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:06,963
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,382
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:11,092
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:29,611
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:32,155 --> 01:07:33,823
These innocent students…

767
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:37,452
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:39,496
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:40,956
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,707
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,669
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:47,837
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:49,881
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:51,883 --> 01:07:53,218
My father was

775
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:56,304
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:58,431 --> 01:08:02,352
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:04,688
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,068
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:13,488
So I ran away.

780
01:08:14,864 --> 01:08:18,535
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:21,287
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:24,040
I wandered around.

783
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,460
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:31,423
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:36,136 --> 01:08:38,221
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:48,273
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:52,986
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:14,841
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:24,976
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:25,685 --> 01:09:26,644
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:37,655
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:41,659 --> 01:09:42,994
I have no idea.

793
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:48,500
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,001
I'm not it!

795
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:50,919
Lady.

796
01:09:51,294 --> 01:09:53,421
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:54,547 --> 01:09:55,423
Stop it!

798
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:57,759
Look.

799
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:00,178
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,890
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:04,599 --> 01:10:07,519
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:10,939
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:11,022 --> 01:10:15,193
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:19,614
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:21,241
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:26,246 --> 01:10:27,872
She's from the North.

807
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:30,875
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:34,003
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:34,337 --> 01:10:36,631
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,635
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:46,349
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:49,811
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:58,945 --> 01:11:00,488
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:01,614 --> 01:11:04,576
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:05,326 --> 01:11:07,036
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:08,872 --> 01:11:10,915
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:14,002 --> 01:11:17,005
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:18,965 --> 01:11:21,009
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:21,092 --> 01:11:22,844
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:23,928
It's so scary.

821
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:27,849
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:29,893
Anyway,

823
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:34,189
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:34,772 --> 01:11:38,651
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:48,703
It's so scary.

826
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:21,778
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:22,362 --> 01:12:23,821
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:27,492
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:29,994
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:35,917
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,546
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:52,392
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:58,731
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:58,082
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,544
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:02,128 --> 01:14:04,922
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,555
I will

838
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,767
go meet my father.

839
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:20,772
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:22,315 --> 01:14:25,360
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,198
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:31,074 --> 01:14:33,659
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:37,372
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:39,332 --> 01:14:42,335
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,381
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:47,757 --> 01:14:50,802
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:53,012
Let me do this.

848
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:54,972
Please?

849
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:23,751
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:26,254
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:29,298
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,884
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:31,968 --> 01:15:33,136
Quiet!

854
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:36,848
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:45,398 --> 01:15:46,315
Hello?

856
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:48,734
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:49,152 --> 01:15:51,946
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:54,198
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:55,533 --> 01:15:57,285
You must come alone.

860
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:10,631
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:14,093
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:15,052 --> 01:16:16,304
We have no choice.

863
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:22,393
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:45,291
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:48,836
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:51,964
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:53,716
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:05,686
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:06,145 --> 01:17:07,897
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,399
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:10,483 --> 01:17:12,818
We must kill him.

872
01:17:13,903 --> 01:17:15,404
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:21,702
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:21,786 --> 01:17:22,954
Over and out.

875
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:23,014
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:47,455 --> 01:18:48,748
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:08,934
Are you all right?

878
01:19:12,063 --> 01:19:13,522
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:19,236 --> 01:19:20,446
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:26,285 --> 01:19:29,121
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:37,797 --> 01:19:38,798
Dad.

882
01:19:39,465 --> 01:19:40,466
Yes?

883
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:47,598
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:48,224 --> 01:19:51,977
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:52,853 --> 01:19:54,271
Please stop it.

886
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:58,567
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:58,651 --> 01:19:59,860
What are you talking about?

888
01:20:00,611 --> 01:20:02,613
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,533
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:07,743
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:19,505
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:23,217
Please save us.

893
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:27,263
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:28,806 --> 01:20:30,474
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:31,892
Don't move.

896
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,314
And my brother…

897
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:40,317
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:42,236 --> 01:20:44,947
died because of me.

899
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,207
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:57,418 --> 01:20:58,919
I won't be able to…

901
01:21:00,254 --> 01:21:01,088
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:02,089 --> 01:21:03,174
Please…

903
01:21:04,091 --> 01:21:07,178
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:11,348
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:12,683
Don't move!

906
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:20,816
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,658
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,709
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:49,094
No!

910
01:22:14,286 --> 01:22:16,789
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,376
Come in!

912
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:21,794
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:22,378 --> 01:22:23,295
Move back!

914
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:24,672
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:26,924 --> 01:22:28,759
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:30,261 --> 01:22:32,429
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,199
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:54,535
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:54,618 --> 01:22:56,495
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:56,579 --> 01:22:58,455
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:00,958
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,835
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:02,918 --> 01:23:05,254
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:05,337 --> 01:23:07,965
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:08,048 --> 01:23:09,842
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:09,925 --> 01:23:11,886
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:11,969 --> 01:23:13,012
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:13,095 --> 01:23:14,847
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:20,477
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,354
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:23,689
What do we do now?

932
01:23:23,772 --> 01:23:26,734
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:29,737
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,906
What if they really

935
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:36,201
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:38,996 --> 01:23:41,790
BONUS

937
01:23:41,874 --> 01:23:44,877
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:47,713 --> 01:23:52,384
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
