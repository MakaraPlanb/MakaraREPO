EPISODE 12

00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,876
ON AIR

4
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,045
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,255
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,549
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,926
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,385
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,678
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,680
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,682
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,268
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,294
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,694
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,362
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,573
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,784
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,746
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,049
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,974
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,144
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,983
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,903
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,453
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,958
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,711
As I thought…

28
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,802
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,312
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,619
kill me now.

31
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,834
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,255
is your father?

33
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,570
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,988
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,663
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,550
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,969
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,014
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,896
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,482
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,455
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,004
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,590
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,720
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,557
Do you believe

47
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,143
your life is yours?

48
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,321
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,241
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,661
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,041
Tonight,

52
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,503
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,674
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,305
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,600
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,560
Now that…

57
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,659
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,001
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,171
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,938
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,941
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,570
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,659
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,037
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,538
I'm just saying

67
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,667
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,628
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,755
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,300
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,139
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,600
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,020
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,857
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,486
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,696
An!

77
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,161
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,250
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,169
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,965
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,384
All right, sir.

82
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,847
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,764
Hey!

84
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,314
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,403
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,031
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,409
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,080
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,209
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,298
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,469
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,929
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,268
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,647
He got a message?

95
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,734
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,699
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,912
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,173
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,883
When he came out,

100
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,260
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,097
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,518
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,645
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,522
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,190
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,568
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,404
That reminds me.

108
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,157
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,951
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,454
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,540
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,457
When was it?

113
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,002
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,922
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,341
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,095
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,513
What do you think?

118
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,724
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,810
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,562
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,647
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,107
Blow them up?

123
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,609
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,486
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,614
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,617
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,452
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,997
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,207
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,042
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,211
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,173
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,387
Hey.

134
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,241
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,203
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,767
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,193
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,364
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,410
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,413
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,793
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,925
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,640
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,269
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,730
Protect me?

147
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,485
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,362
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,785
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,540
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,960
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,713
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,090
Understand?

154
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,214
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,050
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,969
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,764
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,267
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,270
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,190
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,733
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,318
Well…

163
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,490
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,784
a gun at me.

165
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,952
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,457
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,796
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,342
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,760
Maybe…

170
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,348
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
Hey.

172
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,101
Come on.

173
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,477
What?

174
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,482
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,651
made them think it was love

176
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,569
and kiss.

177
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,238
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,907
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,409
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,746
By the way,

181
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,749
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,253
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,629
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,590
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,925
to win the election.

186
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,219
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,930
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,271
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,441
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,028
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,031
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,575
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm fine.

194
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,421
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,511
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,305
Are you serious?

197
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,432
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,394
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,438
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,523
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,108
Gosh…

202
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,679
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,035
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,962
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,633
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,886
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,246
I promise

209
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,708
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,634
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,471
will be all right.

212
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,352
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,606
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,149
Right?

215
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,866
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,328
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,212
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,267
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,676
Charlotte?

220
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,224
Look who's here.

221
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,104
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:03,066
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,318
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,989
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,410
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:18,457
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,795
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,466
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,926
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,472
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,603
Oh, right.

232
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,399
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:53,366
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,288
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,209
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,256
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,677
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,096
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,224
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,351
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,188
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,316
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,484
Oh, my.

244
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,614
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,202
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,789
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,629
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,638
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,266
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,561
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,440
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,527
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,197
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,303
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,472
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,058
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,895
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,483
Let's see…

259
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,957
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,084
There's only one question,

261
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,253
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,963
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,765
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,561
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,147
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,235
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,278
Hey!

268
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,700
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,751
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,838
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,273
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,361
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,946
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,077
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,912
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,792
The deity always

277
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,753
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:39,551
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,554
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,347
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,891
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,536
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,965
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,556
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,519
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,314
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,235
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,072
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,497
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,749
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,252
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,172
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,942
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,528
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,448
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,617
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,120
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,667
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,504
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,214
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,843
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,760
Wait.

303
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,597
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,397
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,232
Arrest her.

307
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,316
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,532
Come here.

309
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,076
Now.

310
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,019
What's up?

311
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,438
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,606
Me?

313
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,859
For what?

314
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,738
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,868
All right.

316
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,132
Start the car!

317
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,182
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,351
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,020
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,230
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,954
Hey.

322
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,873
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,584
What?

324
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,419
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,838
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,509
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,179
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,435
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,645
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,439
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,988
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,372
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,500
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,379
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,172
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,091
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,969
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,598
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,980
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,316
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,947
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,117
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,246
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,874
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,176
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,889
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,433
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,644
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,855
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,900
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,902
You bastards.

352
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,529
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,283
Explosives?

354
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,624
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,711
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,632
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,427
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,554
You bastards!

359
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,434
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,395
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,399
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,612
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,530
One more thing.

364
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,618
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,621
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:25,998
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,133
What?

368
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,426
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,348
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,106
We need to talk.

371
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,945
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,488
What?

373
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,701
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,912
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,123
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,502
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,630
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,508
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,260
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,054
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,723
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,729
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,108
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,735
Okay.

385
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,112
All right.

386
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,831
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,787
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,251
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,087
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,299
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,927
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,597
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:52,311
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,188
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,569
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,072
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,761
Hey.

398
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,725
Hey!

399
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,189
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,733
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,528
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,655
Stop!

403
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,283
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,535
There must be something here.

405
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,747
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,081
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,751
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,170
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,339
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,133
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,053
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,638
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,307
I am not.

414
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,142
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,435
Escape?

416
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,105
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,362
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,197
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,783
I repeat.

420
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,076
Everyone

421
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,327
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,079
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,581
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,795
Wait!

425
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,010
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,389
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,933
My goodness.

428
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,435
What is it this time?

429
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,687
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,483
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,319
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:15,246
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,222
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,853
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,109
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,696
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,031
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,368
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,079
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,999
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,213
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,721
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,312
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,939
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,116
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,831
Why are you

448
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:45,211
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,506
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,931
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,224
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,978
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,149
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,027
I don't…

455
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,573
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,995
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,040
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,711
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,879
I'll go back.

460
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,466
What?

461
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,218
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,390
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,267
Are you insane?

464
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,978
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,604
If I go back,

466
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,526
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,000
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,550
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,927
Wait.

470
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,430
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,519
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,022
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,690
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,734
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,612
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,155
In the restroom?

477
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,407
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,337
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,840
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,635
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,679
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,557
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,612
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,783
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,493
You don't think?

486
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,411
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,749
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,709
To be honest,

489
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,170
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,966
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,678
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,597
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,225
but she did not.

494
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,602
What about your side?

495
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,192
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,113
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,246
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,177
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,429
Last night,

500
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,181
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,352
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,896
I can't.

503
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,566
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,443
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,153
Come out here.

506
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,572
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,325
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,959
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,421
Ma'am.

510
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,855
Just a bite.

511
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,276
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,569
Put that away.

513
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,782
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,204
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,626
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,381
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,092
You can hear now.

518
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,389
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,060
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,062
so we're done for.

521
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,529
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,823
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,492
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,078
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,288
He will.

526
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,792
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,337
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,339
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,300
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,533
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,750
Damn it.

532
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,641
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,477
Please--

534
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,236
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,990
This is your last task.

536
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,661
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,579
Kill them all!

538
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,583
Only ten of you

539
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,962
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,515
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,788
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,600
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,310
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,862
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,989
Attack him!

546
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,632
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,427
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,558
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,694
You little bastard.

550
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,156
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:25,207
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,919
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,504
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,966
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,931
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,059
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,227
The party…

558
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,774
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,027
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,696
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,990
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,413
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,760
Ever since then,

564
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:23,265
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,808
Then

566
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,103
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,773
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,442
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,444
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,739
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,867
Remember.

572
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,452
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,331
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,542
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,962
kill him.

576
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,215
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,177
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,804
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,391
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,954
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,085
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,797
Don't worry.

583
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,176
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,095
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,350
You told the party?

586
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,650
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,402
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,239
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,416
Our plan

591
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,420
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,422
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,718
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,513
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,266
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,600
Sit down.

597
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,729
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,942
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,863
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,076
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,495
From now on,

602
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,997
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,541
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,711
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,879
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,464
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,009
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,260
I told you.

609
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,636
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,847
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,890
I have that radio.

612
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,185
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,691
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,486
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,947
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,408
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,743
Hey.

618
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,329
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,456
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,499
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,796
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,883
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,928
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,681
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,892
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,729
Quiet.

627
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,522
Quiet!

628
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,525
Hold on.

629
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,904
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,532
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,201
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,036
Is this why?

633
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,165
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,126
is all true.

635
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,630
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,048
What?

637
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,508
So it's true?

638
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,928
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,224
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,351
Wiretap?

641
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,977
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,938
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,316
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,238
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,365
I'm sure…

646
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,787
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,039
I see.

648
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,500
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,293
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,254
Was it?

651
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,214
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,842
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,512
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,225
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,940
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,409
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,163
One more step forward,

658
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,749
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,049
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,052
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,265
She is not!

662
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,481
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,150
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,945
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,201
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,204
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:21,998
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,333
That damn b****.

669
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,418
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,839
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,759
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,677
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,721
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,723
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,031
This money…

676
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,033
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,536
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,955
and use her

679
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,416
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,130
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,593
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,972
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,349
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,020
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,856
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,071
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,949
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:25,330
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,915
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,713
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:37,091
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,595
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,805
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,934
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,731
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,527
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,029
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,372
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,336
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,842
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:23,054
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,028
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,574
December 3.

704
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,868
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,705
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,500
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,338
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,465
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,058
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,145
On December 5.

711
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:14,897
What?

712
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,650
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,986
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,618
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,162
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,128
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,838
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,423
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,886
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,805
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,727
Is this bastard

722
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:56,355
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,234
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,613
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,073
Su-hui?

726
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,619
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,497
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,124
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,546
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:27,094
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,182
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,517
We should.

733
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,063
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,067
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,403
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,074
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,493
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,995
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,956
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,624
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,543
I said one sentence.

742
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,503
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,712
Among us?

744
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,024
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,777
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,284
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,661
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,645
Anything unusual?

749
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,063
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,441
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,192
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,820
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,323
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,283
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,830
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,667
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,253
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,660
Hello?

759
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,836
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,091
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,056
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,063
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,482
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,192
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,711
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,923
These innocent students…

767
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,552
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,596
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,056
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,807
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,769
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,937
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,981
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,318
My father was

775
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,404
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:01,452
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,788
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,168
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,588
So I ran away.

780
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:17,635
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,387
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,140
I wandered around.

783
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,560
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,523
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,321
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,373
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:52,086
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,941
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,076
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:25,744
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,755
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,094
I have no idea.

793
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:47,600
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,101
I'm not it!

795
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,019
Lady.

796
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,521
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:54,523
Stop it!

798
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,859
Look.

799
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,278
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,990
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,619
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,039
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:14,293
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,714
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,341
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,972
She's from the North.

807
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,975
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,103
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,731
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,735
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,449
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,911
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,588
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,676
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,136
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,015
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,105
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,109
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,944
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,028
It's so scary.

821
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,949
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,993
Anyway,

823
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:33,289
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:37,751
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:47,803
It's so scary.

826
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:20,878
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,921
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,592
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,094
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,017
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,646
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,492
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:57,831
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,182
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,644
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,022
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,655
I will

838
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,867
go meet my father.

839
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:19,872
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,460
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,298
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,759
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,472
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,435
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,481
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,902
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,112
Let me do this.

848
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,072
Please?

849
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,851
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,354
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:28,398
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,984
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,236
Quiet!

854
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,948
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,415
Hello?

856
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,834
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,046
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:53,298
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,385
You must come alone.

860
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,731
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,193
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:15,404
We have no choice.

863
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,493
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,391
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,936
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,064
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,816
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:04,786
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,997
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,499
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,918
We must kill him.

872
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,504
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,802
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,054
Over and out.

875
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,114
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,848
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:08,034
Are you all right?

878
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,622
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:19,546
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:28,221
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:37,898
Dad.

882
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:39,566
Yes?

883
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:46,698
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:51,077
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,371
Please stop it.

886
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,667
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,960
What are you talking about?

888
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,713
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,633
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,843
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:18,605
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,317
Please save us.

893
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,363
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,574
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,992
Don't move.

896
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,414
And my brother…

897
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,417
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,047
died because of me.

899
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,307
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,019
I won't be able to…

901
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,188
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,274
Please…

903
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,278
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:10,448
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,783
Don't move!

906
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,916
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,758
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,809
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,194
No!

910
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:15,889
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:19,476
Come in!

912
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:20,894
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,395
Move back!

914
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,772
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,859
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,529
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,299
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,635
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,595
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,555
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,058
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,935
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:04,354
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:07,065
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,942
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,986
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,112
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,947
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:19,577
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,454
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,789
What do we do now?

932
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,834
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,837
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,006
What if they really

935
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,301
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:40,890
BONUS

937
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,977
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:51,484
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
