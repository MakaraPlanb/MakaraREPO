EPISODE 12

00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,876
ON AIR

4
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,045
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,255
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,549
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:31,926
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,385
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,678
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,680
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,682
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,268
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,294
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,694
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,362
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,573
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,784
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,746
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,049
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,974
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,144
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,983
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,903
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,453
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,958
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,711
As I thought…

28
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,802
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,312
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,619
kill me now.

31
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,834
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,255
is your father?

33
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,570
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,988
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,663
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,005
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,550
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,969
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,014
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,896
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,482
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,455
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,004
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,590
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,720
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,557
Do you believe

47
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,143
your life is yours?

48
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,321
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,241
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,661
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,041
Tonight,

52
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,503
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,674
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,305
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,600
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,560
Now that…

57
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,903
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,659
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,001
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,171
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,938
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,941
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,570
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,659
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,037
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,538
I'm just saying

67
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,667
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,628
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,755
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,300
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,139
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,600
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,020
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,857
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,486
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,696
An!

77
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,161
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,250
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,169
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,965
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,384
All right, sir.

82
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,847
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,764
Hey!

84
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,314
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,403
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,031
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,409
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:27,080
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:31,209
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,298
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,469
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,929
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,268
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,647
He got a message?

95
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,734
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,699
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,912
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,173
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,883
When he came out,

100
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,260
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,097
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,518
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,645
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,522
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,190
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,568
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,404
That reminds me.

108
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,157
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,951
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,454
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,540
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,457
When was it?

113
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,002
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,922
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,341
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:05,095
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,513
What do you think?

118
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,724
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,810
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,562
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,647
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,107
Blow them up?

123
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,609
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,486
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,614
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,617
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,452
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,997
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,207
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,042
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,211
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,173
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,387
Hey.

134
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,241
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,203
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,767
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,193
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,364
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,410
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,413
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,793
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,170
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,925
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,640
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:18,269
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,730
Protect me?

147
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,485
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,362
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,785
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,540
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,960
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,713
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,090
Understand?

154
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,214
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,050
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,969
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,764
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,267
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,270
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,190
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,733
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,318
Well…

163
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,490
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,784
a gun at me.

165
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,952
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:02,457
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,796
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,342
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,760
Maybe…

170
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,348
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,265
Hey.

172
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,101
Come on.

173
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,477
What?

174
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:27,482
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,651
made them think it was love

176
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,569
and kiss.

177
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,238
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,907
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,409
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,746
By the way,

181
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,749
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,253
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,629
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,590
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,925
to win the election.

186
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,219
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,930
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,271
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,441
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:14,028
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,031
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,575
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,834
I'm fine.

194
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,421
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,511
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,305
Are you serious?

197
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,432
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,394
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,438
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,523
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,108
Gosh…

202
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,679
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,035
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,623
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,962
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,633
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,886
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,246
I promise

209
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,708
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,634
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,471
will be all right.

212
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,352
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,606
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,149
Right?

215
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,866
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,328
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,212
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,267
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,676
Charlotte?

220
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,224
Look who's here.

221
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,104
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:02,066
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,318
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,989
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,410
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:17,457
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,795
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,466
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,926
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,472
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:38,603
Oh, right.

232
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,399
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:52,366
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,288
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:01,209
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,256
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,677
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,096
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,224
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,351
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,188
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,316
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,484
Oh, my.

244
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,614
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,202
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,789
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,629
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,638
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,266
Have you two made up already?

250
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,561
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,440
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,527
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,197
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,303
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,472
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,058
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:44,895
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,483
Let's see…

259
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,957
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,084
There's only one question,

261
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,253
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,963
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,765
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,561
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,147
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,235
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,278
Hey!

268
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,700
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,751
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,838
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,273
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,361
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,946
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,077
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,912
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,792
The deity always

277
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,753
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:38,551
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,554
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,347
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,891
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,536
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,965
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,556
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:30,519
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,314
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,235
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,072
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,497
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,749
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,252
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,172
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,942
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,528
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,448
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,617
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,120
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,667
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,504
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,214
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,843
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:44,760
Wait.

303
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,597
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,853
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,397
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,232
Arrest her.

307
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,316
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,532
Come here.

309
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,076
Now.

310
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,019
What's up?

311
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,438
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,606
Me?

313
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,859
For what?

314
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,738
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,868
All right.

316
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,132
Start the car!

317
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,182
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,351
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,020
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,230
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,954
Hey.

322
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,873
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,584
What?

324
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,419
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,838
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,509
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,179
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:58,435
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,645
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,439
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,988
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,372
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,500
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,379
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,172
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,091
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,969
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:36,598
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,980
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,316
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,947
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,117
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,246
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,874
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,176
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:16,889
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,433
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,644
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,855
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,900
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,902
You bastards.

352
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,529
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,283
Explosives?

354
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,624
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,711
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,632
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:55,427
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,554
You bastards!

359
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,434
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,395
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,399
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,612
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:14,530
One more thing.

364
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,618
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,621
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:24,998
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,133
What?

368
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,426
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,348
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,106
We need to talk.

371
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,945
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,488
What?

373
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,701
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,912
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,123
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,502
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,630
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:16,508
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,260
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,054
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,723
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,729
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,108
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,735
Okay.

385
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,112
All right.

386
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,831
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,787
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,251
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,087
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,299
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,927
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,597
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:51,311
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,188
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,569
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,072
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:24,761
Hey.

398
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,725
Hey!

399
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,189
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,733
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,528
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,655
Stop!

403
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,283
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,535
There must be something here.

405
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,747
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,081
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,751
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,170
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,339
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,133
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:06,053
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,638
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,307
I am not.

414
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,142
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,435
Escape?

416
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:17,105
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,362
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,197
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,783
I repeat.

420
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,076
Everyone

421
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,327
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,079
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,581
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,795
Wait!

425
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,010
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,389
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,933
My goodness.

428
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,435
What is it this time?

429
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,687
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,483
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,319
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:14,246
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,222
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,853
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,109
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,696
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,031
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,368
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,079
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,999
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,213
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,721
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,312
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,939
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,116
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,831
Why are you

448
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:44,211
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,506
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,931
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,224
Yeong-ro…

452
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,978
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,149
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,027
I don't…

455
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,573
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,995
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,040
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,711
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:27,879
I'll go back.

460
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:31,466
What?

461
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,218
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,390
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,267
Are you insane?

464
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,978
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,604
If I go back,

466
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,526
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,000
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,550
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:15,927
Wait.

470
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,430
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,519
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,022
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,690
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,734
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,612
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,155
In the restroom?

477
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,407
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,337
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,840
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,635
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,679
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,557
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,612
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,783
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,493
You don't think?

486
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,411
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,749
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,709
To be honest,

489
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,170
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,966
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,678
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,597
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,225
but she did not.

494
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,602
What about your side?

495
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,192
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,113
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,246
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,177
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,429
Last night,

500
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,181
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,352
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,896
I can't.

503
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:16,566
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,443
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,153
Come out here.

506
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,572
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,325
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,959
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,421
Ma'am.

510
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:55,855
Just a bite.

511
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,276
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,569
Put that away.

513
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,782
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,204
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,626
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,381
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,092
You can hear now.

518
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:29,389
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,060
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,062
so we're done for.

521
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,529
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,823
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,492
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,078
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,288
He will.

526
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,792
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,337
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,339
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,300
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,533
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,750
Damn it.

532
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:54,641
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,477
Please--

534
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,236
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,990
This is your last task.

536
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,661
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:16,579
Kill them all!

538
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,583
Only ten of you

539
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,962
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,515
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,788
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,600
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,310
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,862
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:32,989
Attack him!

546
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,632
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,427
I know what your order means.

548
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,558
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,694
You little bastard.

550
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,156
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:24,207
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,919
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,504
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,966
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,931
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,059
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,227
The party…

558
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:49,774
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,027
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,696
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,990
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,413
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,760
Ever since then,

564
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,265
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:23,808
Then

566
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:27,103
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:30,773
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,442
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,444
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,739
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:40,867
Remember.

572
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,452
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,331
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,542
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,962
kill him.

576
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,215
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,177
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,804
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,391
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:26,954
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,085
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,797
Don't worry.

583
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,176
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,095
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:47,350
You told the party?

586
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,063
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,650
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,402
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,239
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,416
Our plan

591
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,420
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,422
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,718
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,513
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,266
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,600
Sit down.

597
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,729
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,942
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,863
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,076
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,495
From now on,

602
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,997
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,541
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,711
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,879
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,464
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,009
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:04,260
I told you.

609
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,636
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,847
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,890
I have that radio.

612
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,185
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,691
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,486
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:24,947
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:27,408
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:28,743
Hey.

618
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,329
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:33,456
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,499
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,796
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,883
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,928
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,681
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,892
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,729
Quiet.

627
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,522
Quiet!

628
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,525
Hold on.

629
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,904
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,532
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,201
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,036
Is this why?

633
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,165
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,126
is all true.

635
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,630
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,048
What?

637
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,508
So it's true?

638
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,928
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:33,224
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,351
Wiretap?

641
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,977
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,938
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,316
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,238
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:49,365
I'm sure…

646
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:54,787
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,039
I see.

648
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:59,500
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,293
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,254
Was it?

651
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,214
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,842
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,512
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:16,225
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,940
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,409
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,163
One more step forward,

658
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,749
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:49,049
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,052
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,265
She is not!

662
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,481
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,150
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,945
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,201
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,204
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:20,998
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,333
That damn b****.

669
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,418
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,839
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:31,759
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,677
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,721
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,723
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,031
This money…

676
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,033
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,536
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,955
and use her

679
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,416
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:51,130
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:55,593
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,972
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,349
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,020
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,856
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,071
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,949
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:24,330
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,915
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,713
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,091
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,595
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,805
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:45,934
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,731
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,527
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,029
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,372
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,336
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:18,842
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,054
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,028
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,574
December 3.

704
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,868
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,705
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,500
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:56,338
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:58,465
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,058
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:11,145
On December 5.

711
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:13,897
What?

712
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,650
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,986
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,618
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:28,162
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,128
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,838
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,423
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:43,886
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,805
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,727
Is this bastard

722
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:55,355
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:59,234
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:02,613
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,073
Su-hui?

726
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,619
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,497
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,124
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:19,546
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:26,094
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:30,182
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,517
We should.

733
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:36,063
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,067
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,403
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:47,074
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,493
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:51,995
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,956
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,624
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,543
I said one sentence.

742
01:03:58,252 --> 01:03:59,503
What if it's among us?

743
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,712
Among us?

744
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,024
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,777
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,284
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,661
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:58,645
Anything unusual?

749
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,063
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,441
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,192
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,820
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,323
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,283
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,830
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:20,667
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:05,253
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:36,660
Hello?

759
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:45,836
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:51,091
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:58,056
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,063
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,482
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,192
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,711
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:31,923
These innocent students…

767
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,552
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,596
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,056
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:40,807
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,769
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,937
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,981
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,318
My father was

775
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,404
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,452
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,788
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,168
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,588
So I ran away.

780
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:16,635
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,387
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,140
I wandered around.

783
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,560
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,523
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,321
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,373
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:51,086
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:12,941
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,076
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:24,744
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:35,755
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,094
I have no idea.

793
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:46,600
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,101
I'm not it!

795
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,019
Lady.

796
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,521
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,523
Stop it!

798
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:55,859
Look.

799
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,278
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,990
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,619
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,039
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:13,293
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,714
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,341
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:25,972
She's from the North.

807
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,975
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,103
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,731
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,735
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,449
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,911
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,588
I'm sorry…

814
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:02,676
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,136
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:09,015
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:15,105
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:19,109
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,944
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,028
It's so scary.

821
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,949
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:27,993
Anyway,

823
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:32,289
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,751
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,803
It's so scary.

826
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,878
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:21,921
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,592
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,094
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:34,017
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,646
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:50,492
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:56,831
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,182
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,644
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,022
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,655
I will

838
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,867
go meet my father.

839
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,872
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,460
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,298
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,759
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:35,472
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:40,435
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,481
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,902
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,112
Let me do this.

848
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,072
Please?

849
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,851
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:24,354
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,398
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,984
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:31,236
Quiet!

854
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,948
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:44,415
Hello?

856
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,834
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:50,046
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,298
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,385
You must come alone.

860
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,731
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:12,193
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,404
We have no choice.

863
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:20,493
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:43,391
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:46,936
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,064
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,816
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:03,786
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,997
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,499
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,918
We must kill him.

872
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:13,504
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,802
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:21,054
Over and out.

875
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,114
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:46,848
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,034
Are you all right?

878
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,622
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,546
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:27,221
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:36,898
Dad.

882
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:38,566
Yes?

883
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:45,698
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:50,077
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,371
Please stop it.

886
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,667
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:57,960
What are you talking about?

888
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,713
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:03,633
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,843
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:17,605
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,317
Please save us.

893
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:25,363
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,574
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:29,992
Don't move.

896
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,414
And my brother…

897
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,417
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,047
died because of me.

899
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,307
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,019
I won't be able to…

901
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,188
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,274
Please…

903
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,278
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:09,448
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:10,783
Don't move!

906
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,916
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,758
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:36,809
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:47,194
No!

910
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,889
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,476
Come in!

912
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,894
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:21,395
Move back!

914
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,772
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,859
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,529
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:50,299
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,635
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,595
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:56,555
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,058
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,935
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:03,354
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,065
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,942
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,986
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:11,112
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:12,947
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:18,577
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,454
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:21,789
What do we do now?

932
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,834
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:27,837
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:30,006
What if they really

935
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:34,301
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:39,890
BONUS

937
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,977
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:50,484
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
