EPISODE 12

00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,976
ON AIR

4
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,145
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:30,355
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,649
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,026
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,485
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,778
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:38,780
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,782
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,368
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,394
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,794
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:35,462
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,673
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:40,884
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,846
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:56,149
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:04,074
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,244
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,083
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,003
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:24,553
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,058
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,811
As I thought…

28
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:08,902
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:19,412
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,719
kill me now.

31
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,934
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,355
is your father?

33
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,670
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,088
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,763
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,105
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,650
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,069
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:36,114
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:42,996
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,582
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:00,555
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:08,104
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:10,690
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,820
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,657
Do you believe

47
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,243
your life is yours?

48
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:33,421
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,341
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:39,761
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:45,141
Tonight,

52
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:48,603
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:52,774
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,405
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,700
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:03,660
Now that…

57
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,003
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,759
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,101
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,271
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,038
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:52,041
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:55,670
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,759
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,137
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:05,638
I'm just saying

67
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:08,767
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,728
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,855
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,400
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:23,239
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:25,700
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,120
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:32,957
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,586
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,796
An!

77
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,261
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,350
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:53,269
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:57,065
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,484
All right, sir.

82
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,947
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,864
Hey!

84
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:13,414
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,503
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:22,131
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,509
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:29,180
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:33,309
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:38,398
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:42,569
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,029
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,368
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,747
He got a message?

95
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,834
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,799
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:09,012
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:20,273
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:21,983
When he came out,

100
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,360
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,197
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:31,618
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,745
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,622
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,290
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:40,668
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,504
That reminds me.

108
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:46,257
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,051
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:51,554
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,640
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:54,557
When was it?

113
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:58,102
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:01,022
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,441
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:07,195
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,613
What do you think?

118
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:11,824
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,910
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,662
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,747
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,207
Blow them up?

123
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,709
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,586
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,714
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,717
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,552
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,097
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,307
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,142
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,311
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:44,273
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:49,487
Hey.

134
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,341
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,303
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,867
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,293
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,464
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,510
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,513
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:01,893
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,270
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:09,025
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:15,740
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:20,369
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:22,830
Protect me?

147
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:27,585
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:29,462
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,885
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,640
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:44,060
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,813
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,190
Understand?

154
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,314
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,150
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,069
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,864
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,367
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,370
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:47,290
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:48,833
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,418
Well…

163
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:55,590
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,884
a gun at me.

165
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,052
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:04,557
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,896
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:14,442
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:15,860
Maybe…

170
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,448
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,365
Hey.

172
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:23,201
Come on.

173
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:24,577
What?

174
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:29,582
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,751
made them think it was love

176
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,669
and kiss.

177
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,338
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:38,007
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,509
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,846
By the way,

181
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,849
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,353
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,729
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:54,690
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,025
to win the election.

186
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,319
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,030
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,371
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,541
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,128
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:19,131
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,675
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:29,934
I'm fine.

194
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,521
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:40,611
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,405
Are you serious?

197
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,532
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,494
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,538
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:52,623
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,208
Gosh…

202
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,779
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,135
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,723
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,062
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,733
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,986
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,346
I promise

209
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:15,808
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,734
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:28,571
will be all right.

212
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:34,452
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:38,706
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:40,249
Right?

215
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,966
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,428
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:01,312
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,367
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:48,776
Charlotte?

220
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:55,324
Look who's here.

221
00:23:56,367 --> 00:24:00,204
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:04,166
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,418
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:10,089
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,510
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:19,557
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:24,895
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,566
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,026
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,572
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:40,703
Oh, right.

232
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,499
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:54,466
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,388
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:03,309
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:09,356
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,777
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:16,196
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,324
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:20,451
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:24,288
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,416
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,584
Oh, my.

244
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:33,714
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,302
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,889
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:48,729
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:57,738
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:00,366
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,661
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:08,540
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,627
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:15,297
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,403
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:40,572
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,158
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:46,995
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,583
Let's see…

259
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:07,057
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:09,184
There's only one question,

261
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:11,353
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,063
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:22,865
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:27,661
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,247
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,335
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:36,378
Hey!

268
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:41,800
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,851
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:54,938
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,373
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,461
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:19,046
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,177
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,012
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:31,892
The deity always

277
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,853
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:40,651
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:43,654
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:45,447
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,991
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:07,636
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:20,065
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:27,656
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:32,619
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:35,414
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,335
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,172
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:51,597
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,849
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,352
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,272
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,042
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:22,628
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:26,548
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:28,717
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,220
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:36,767
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:40,604
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,314
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:45,943
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:46,860
Wait.

303
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,697
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,953
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,497
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,332
Arrest her.

307
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:01,416
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,632
Come here.

309
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:11,176
Now.

310
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:37,119
What's up?

311
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,538
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:40,706
Me?

313
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:43,959
For what?

314
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,838
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:52,968
All right.

316
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,232
Start the car!

317
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:15,282
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,451
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:20,120
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:22,330
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:37,054
Hey.

322
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,973
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,684
What?

324
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:44,519
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,938
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:50,609
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:54,279
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:57,491 --> 00:33:00,535
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:01,745
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:04,539
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,088
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,472
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,600
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:27,479
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,272
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:31,191
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,069
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:38,698
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,080
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:48,416
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,047
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,217
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,346
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:03,974
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:14,276
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:18,989
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:21,533
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,744
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,955
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:30,000
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,002
You bastards.

352
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,629
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:38,383
Explosives?

354
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:45,724
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:49,811
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,732
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:57,527
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:58,695 --> 00:34:59,654
You bastards!

359
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:04,534
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,495
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,499
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,712
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:16,630
One more thing.

364
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,718
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,721
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:27,098
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:36,233
What?

368
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:38,526
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:43,448
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,206
We need to talk.

371
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:57,045
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:58,588
What?

373
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,801
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:06,012
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,223
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:12,602
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:15,730
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:18,608
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,360
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:23,154
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:24,823
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:30,829
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,208
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,835
Okay.

385
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:39,212
All right.

386
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:49,931
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:28,887
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,351
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,187
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,399
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:44,027
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:47,697
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:53,411
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:55,288
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,669
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:04,172
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:25,944 --> 00:38:26,861
Hey.

398
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,825
Hey!

399
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,289
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:39,833
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:43,628
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,755
Stop!

403
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,383
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:50,635
There must be something here.

405
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:53,847
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,181
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,851
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,270
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:02,439
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:05,233
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:05,316 --> 00:39:08,153
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:10,738
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:11,573 --> 00:39:12,407
I am not.

414
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,242
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:15,535
Escape?

416
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:19,205
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:25,462
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:27,297
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,883
I repeat.

420
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:31,176
Everyone

421
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:32,427
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,179
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:36,681
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,895
Wait!

425
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:49,110
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,489
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,033
My goodness.

428
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:57,535
What is it this time?

429
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,787
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,583
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,419
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:16,346
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:34,322
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,953
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:46,209
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:48,294 --> 00:40:49,796
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:52,131
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:55,468
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:58,179
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:01,099
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:07,313
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,821
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,412
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,039
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,216
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:40,638 --> 00:41:41,931
Why are you

448
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:46,311
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:49,606
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:58,031
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,324
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:04,078
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:08,249
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,127
I don't…

455
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,673
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:21,095
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,140
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,811
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:29,979
I'll go back.

460
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:33,566
What?

461
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,318
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:40,490
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:42,367
Are you insane?

464
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:45,078
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,704
If I go back,

466
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:51,626
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:07,100
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,650
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:18,027
Wait.

470
00:43:18,736 --> 00:43:20,530
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,619
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,122
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:30,790
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:32,834
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,712
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:37,255
In the restroom?

477
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:39,507
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,437
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:55,940
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:58,735
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,779
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:04,657
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,712
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:21,883
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:23,593
You don't think?

486
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:25,511
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:29,849
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:31,809
To be honest,

489
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:34,270
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:39,066
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,778
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:44,697
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:47,325
but she did not.

494
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:49,702
What about your side?

495
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:56,292
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:00,213
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:50,346
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,277
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:05,194 --> 00:46:06,529
Last night,

500
00:46:06,612 --> 00:46:08,281
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:12,243 --> 00:46:13,452
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:14,996
I can't.

503
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:18,666
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:20,543
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:22,253
Come out here.

506
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:24,672
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:27,425
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:37,059
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:40,521
Ma'am.

510
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:57,955
Just a bite.

511
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,376
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,669
Put that away.

513
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:07,882
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:13,304
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:18,726
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:23,481
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,192
You can hear now.

518
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:31,489
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:36,160
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:38,162
so we're done for.

521
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,629
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:48,923
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:51,592
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:54,178
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:54,261 --> 00:47:55,388
He will.

526
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:59,892
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:03,437
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:05,439
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:07,400
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,633
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:40,850
Damn it.

532
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:56,741
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:58,242 --> 00:48:59,577
Please--

534
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:09,336
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,090
This is your last task.

536
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:16,761
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:17,595 --> 00:49:18,679
Kill them all!

538
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:22,683
Only ten of you

539
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:26,062
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:37,615
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,888
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:21,700
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:23,410
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,962
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:35,089
Attack him!

546
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:53,732
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:56,527
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:01,115 --> 00:51:02,658
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,794
You little bastard.

550
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:17,256
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:26,307
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:30,019
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:31,604
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,066
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:42,031
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:42,114 --> 00:51:45,159
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:45,242 --> 00:51:46,327
The party…

558
00:51:49,163 --> 00:51:51,874
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,127
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,796
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,090
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,513
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:19,860
Ever since then,

564
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:24,365
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:25,908
Then

566
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:29,203
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:32,873
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:33,874 --> 00:52:35,542
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:37,544
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,839
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:42,967
Remember.

572
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,552
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:49,431
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:51,642
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:55,062
kill him.

576
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:58,315
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:01,277
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:03,904
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:07,491
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:27,928 --> 00:53:29,054
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:35,185
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:38,897
Don't worry.

583
00:53:40,232 --> 00:53:42,276
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:45,195
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:49,450
You told the party?

586
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:54,163
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,750
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:00,502
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:03,339
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,516
Our plan

591
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:18,520
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:20,522
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:24,818
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:27,613
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:30,366
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:31,700
Sit down.

597
00:54:34,661 --> 00:54:35,829
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:40,042
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,963
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:49,176
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:51,595
From now on,

602
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:53,097
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:53,764 --> 00:54:55,641
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:58,811
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:00,979
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:02,564
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:05,109
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:06,360
I told you.

609
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:07,736
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,947
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,990
I have that radio.

612
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:15,285
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,791
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,586
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:27,047
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:29,508
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:29,591 --> 00:55:30,843
Hey.

618
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:33,429
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:33,512 --> 00:55:35,556
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:37,599
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:42,896
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:45,983
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:50,028
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:52,781
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:54,992
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:57,786 --> 00:55:58,829
Quiet.

627
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,622
Quiet!

628
00:56:02,332 --> 00:56:03,625
Hold on.

629
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:07,004
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:10,632
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:12,301
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:14,136
Is this why?

633
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:18,265
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:21,226
is all true.

635
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:24,730
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:26,148
What?

637
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:27,608
So it's true?

638
00:56:27,691 --> 00:56:31,028
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:35,324
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:37,451
Wiretap?

641
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,077
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,038
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:44,416
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:49,338
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:50,464 --> 00:56:51,465
I'm sure…

646
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:56,887
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:57,888 --> 00:56:59,139
I see.

648
00:56:59,223 --> 00:57:01,600
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:03,393
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,354
Was it?

651
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:07,314
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:09,942
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:13,612
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:18,325
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:25,040
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:35,509
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:39,263
One more step forward,

658
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:42,849
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:51,149
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:54,152
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:58,365
She is not!

662
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,581
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:08,250
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:12,045
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,301
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:18,302 --> 00:58:20,304
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:23,098
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:24,433
That damn b****.

669
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:26,518
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:30,939
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:33,859
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:35,777
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:37,821
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:37,904 --> 00:58:39,823
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:38,131
This money…

676
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:40,133
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,636
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:43,553 --> 00:59:45,055
and use her

679
00:59:45,764 --> 00:59:47,516
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:53,230
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:57,693
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:02,072
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:04,449
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:06,618 --> 01:00:08,120
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:10,956
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:16,795 --> 01:00:18,171
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,049
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:26,430
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:29,015
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:34,813
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:38,191
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:41,695
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:41,778 --> 01:00:43,905
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:48,034
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:52,831
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,627
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:59,129
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:07,137 --> 01:01:08,472
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,436
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:17,355 --> 01:01:20,942
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:24,154
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:38,835 --> 01:01:40,128
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:44,674
December 3.

704
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:46,968
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:48,136 --> 01:01:49,805
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:53,600
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:58,438
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:00,565
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:10,158
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:10,242 --> 01:02:13,245
On December 5.

711
01:02:15,163 --> 01:02:15,997
What?

712
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:18,750
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:21,086
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:26,883 --> 01:02:28,718
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:30,262
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:37,018 --> 01:02:38,228
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:39,938
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:41,523
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:42,107 --> 01:02:45,986
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:48,905
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:53,827
Is this bastard

722
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:57,455
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:01,334
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:04,713
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:07,173
Su-hui?

726
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,719
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:13,597
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,224
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:21,646
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:28,194
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:28,862 --> 01:03:32,282
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:33,617
We should.

733
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:38,163
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:42,167
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:45,503
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:49,174
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:51,593
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:54,095
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:56,056
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:56,139 --> 01:03:57,724
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,643
I said one sentence.

742
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,603
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:01,686 --> 01:04:02,812
Among us?

744
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:23,124
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:25,877
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:29,506 --> 01:04:32,384
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:32,509 --> 01:04:34,761
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:59,744 --> 01:05:00,745
Anything unusual?

749
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:02,163
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:04,541
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,292
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,920
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:11,423
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:13,383
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:18,930
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:19,014 --> 01:05:22,767
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:06,019 --> 01:06:07,353
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:37,926 --> 01:06:38,760
Hello?

759
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:47,936
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:51,356 --> 01:06:53,191
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:57,654 --> 01:07:00,156
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:07,163
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:09,582
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,292
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:29,811
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:32,355 --> 01:07:34,023
These innocent students…

767
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,652
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:39,696
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:39,779 --> 01:07:41,156
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:42,907
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:45,869
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:45,952 --> 01:07:48,037
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:50,081
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,418
My father was

775
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:56,504
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:02,552
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:04,888
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:10,268
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:13,688
So I ran away.

780
01:08:15,064 --> 01:08:18,735
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:21,487
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:24,240
I wandered around.

783
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:27,660
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,623
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:38,421
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,473
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:49,474 --> 01:08:53,186
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:15,041
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:25,176
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:26,844
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:36,396 --> 01:09:37,855
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,194
I have no idea.

793
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:48,700
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,201
I'm not it!

795
01:09:50,285 --> 01:09:51,119
Lady.

796
01:09:51,494 --> 01:09:53,621
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:55,623
Stop it!

798
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:57,959
Look.

799
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:00,378
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:04,090
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,719
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:07,802 --> 01:10:11,139
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:15,393
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:16,352 --> 01:10:19,814
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:19,897 --> 01:10:21,441
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:28,072
She's from the North.

807
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:31,075
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:34,203
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:36,831
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,835
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:46,549
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:50,011
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:59,145 --> 01:11:00,688
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:04,776
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:05,526 --> 01:11:07,236
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:11,115
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:17,205
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:21,209
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:23,044
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:24,128
It's so scary.

821
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,049
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:30,093
Anyway,

823
01:11:31,177 --> 01:11:34,389
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:38,851
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:48,903
It's so scary.

826
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:21,978
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:24,021
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:27,692
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:28,901 --> 01:12:30,194
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:36,117
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:40,746
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:49,297 --> 01:12:52,592
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:58,931
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:58,282
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:01,744
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:05,122
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:12,755
I will

838
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:15,967
go meet my father.

839
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:20,972
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:25,560
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:30,398
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:33,859
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:33,943 --> 01:14:37,572
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:42,535
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:46,581
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:51,002
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:53,212
Let me do this.

848
01:14:54,088 --> 01:14:55,172
Please?

849
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:23,951
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:26,454
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:26,662 --> 01:15:29,498
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,084
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:33,336
Quiet!

854
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:37,048
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:45,598 --> 01:15:46,515
Hello?

856
01:15:46,599 --> 01:15:48,934
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:52,146
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:54,398
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,485
You must come alone.

860
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:10,831
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:11,624 --> 01:16:14,293
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:16,504
We have no choice.

863
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:22,593
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:45,491
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:45,991 --> 01:16:49,036
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:52,164
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:52,248 --> 01:16:53,916
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:05,886
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:08,097
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,599
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:13,018
We must kill him.

872
01:17:14,103 --> 01:17:15,604
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,902
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:21,986 --> 01:17:23,154
Over and out.

875
01:18:21,837 --> 01:18:23,214
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:48,948
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:09,134
Are you all right?

878
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,722
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:20,646
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:29,321
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:37,997 --> 01:19:38,998
Dad.

882
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:40,666
Yes?

883
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:47,798
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:48,424 --> 01:19:52,177
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:53,053 --> 01:19:54,471
Please stop it.

886
01:19:55,931 --> 01:19:58,767
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:58,851 --> 01:20:00,060
What are you talking about?

888
01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:02,813
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:05,733
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:05,816 --> 01:20:07,943
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:19,705
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:21,832 --> 01:20:23,417
Please save us.

893
01:20:25,878 --> 01:20:27,463
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:30,674
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:32,092
Don't move.

896
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,514
And my brother…

897
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:40,517
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:45,147
died because of me.

899
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,407
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:59,119
I won't be able to…

901
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:01,288
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:03,374
Please…

903
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:07,378
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:11,548
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:12,883
Don't move!

906
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:21,016
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,858
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:37,533 --> 01:21:38,909
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:48,335 --> 01:21:49,294
No!

910
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:16,989
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:20,576
Come in!

912
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:21,994
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:22,578 --> 01:22:23,495
Move back!

914
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:24,872
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:27,124 --> 01:22:28,959
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:32,629
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,399
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:54,735
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:56,695
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:56,779 --> 01:22:58,655
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:01,158
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:03,035
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:03,118 --> 01:23:05,454
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:05,537 --> 01:23:08,165
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:08,248 --> 01:23:10,042
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,086
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:13,212
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:13,295 --> 01:23:15,047
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:20,677
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:20,761 --> 01:23:22,554
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:22,638 --> 01:23:23,889
What do we do now?

932
01:23:23,972 --> 01:23:26,934
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:27,518 --> 01:23:29,937
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:32,106
What if they really

935
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:36,401
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:39,196 --> 01:23:41,990
BONUS

937
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:45,077
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:47,913 --> 01:23:52,584
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
