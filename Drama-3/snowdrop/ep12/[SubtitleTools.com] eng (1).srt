EPISODE 12

00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,076
ON AIR

4
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,245
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,455
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,749
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,126
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,585
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:36,878
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,880
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,882
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,468
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,494
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,894
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:35,562
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:37,773
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,984
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,946
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:56,249
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,174
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:07,344
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,183
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,103
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:24,653
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,158
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:01,911
As I thought…

28
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,002
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,512
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,819
kill me now.

31
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,034
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,455
is your father?

33
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,770
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,188
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,863
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:27,205
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,750
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,169
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,214
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:43,096
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,682
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,655
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:08,204
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,790
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,920
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:18,757
Do you believe

47
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,343
your life is yours?

48
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:33,521
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,441
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:39,861
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,241
Tonight,

52
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,703
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,874
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,505
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,800
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:03,760
Now that…

57
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,103
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,859
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,201
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,371
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,138
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:52,141
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,770
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,859
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,237
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:05,738
I'm just saying

67
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,867
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,828
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:13,955
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,500
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,339
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,800
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:29,220
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:33,057
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,686
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:37,896
An!

77
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,361
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,450
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,369
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,165
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,584
All right, sir.

82
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,047
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,964
Hey!

84
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,514
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,603
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:22,231
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:24,609
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:29,280
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:33,409
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:38,498
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:42,669
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,129
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,468
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,847
He got a message?

95
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:57,934
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,899
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,112
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:20,373
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,083
When he came out,

100
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,460
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,297
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:31,718
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,845
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,722
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,390
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,768
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,604
That reminds me.

108
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,357
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,151
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:51,654
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,740
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:54,657
When was it?

113
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:58,202
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:01,122
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:03,541
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:07,295
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:08,713
What do you think?

118
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,924
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:14,010
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,762
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,847
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,307
Blow them up?

123
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,809
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,686
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,814
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,817
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,652
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,197
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,407
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,242
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,411
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,373
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,587
Hey.

134
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,441
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,403
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:35,967
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:45,393
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,564
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,610
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,613
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:01,993
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,370
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:09,125
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:15,840
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:20,469
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:22,930
Protect me?

147
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:27,685
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,562
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,985
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,740
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,160
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:46,913
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,290
Understand?

154
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,414
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,250
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,169
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:37,964
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:41,467
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,470
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:47,390
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:48,933
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,518
Well…

163
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,690
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,984
a gun at me.

165
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,152
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,657
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,996
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:14,542
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:15,960
Maybe…

170
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,548
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:21,465
Hey.

172
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:23,301
Come on.

173
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:24,677
What?

174
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:29,682
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,851
made them think it was love

176
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,769
and kiss.

177
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,438
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,107
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,609
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,946
By the way,

181
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,949
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,453
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:51,829
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:54,790
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,125
to win the election.

186
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,419
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,130
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,471
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,641
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:16,228
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:19,231
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,775
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,034
I'm fine.

194
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,621
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:40,711
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:42,505
Are you serious?

197
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,632
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,594
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:50,638
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:52,723
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,308
Gosh…

202
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,879
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:28,235
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:32,823
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:38,162
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:42,833
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,086
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:12,446
I promise

209
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:15,908
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,834
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,671
will be all right.

212
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,552
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:38,806
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:40,349
Right?

215
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,066
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,528
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:01,412
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,467
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:48,876
Charlotte?

220
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,424
Look who's here.

221
00:23:56,467 --> 00:24:00,304
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:04,266
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,518
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:10,189
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,610
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:19,657
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:24,995
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,666
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,126
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,672
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:40,803
Oh, right.

232
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,599
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:54,566
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,488
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:03,409
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:09,456
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,877
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,296
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,424
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:20,551
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:24,388
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,516
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,684
Oh, my.

244
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:33,814
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,402
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,989
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:48,829
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:57,838
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,466
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,761
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:08,640
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:11,727
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:15,397
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,503
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:40,672
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,258
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:47,095
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:51,683
Let's see…

259
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:07,157
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,284
There's only one question,

261
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,453
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,163
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:22,965
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:27,761
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,347
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,435
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:36,478
Hey!

268
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:41,900
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,951
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:55,038
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,473
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,561
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:19,146
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,277
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,112
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:31,992
The deity always

277
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,953
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:40,751
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:43,754
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:45,547
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:48,091
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,736
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,165
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:27,756
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,719
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:35,514
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:40,435
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,272
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:51,697
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,949
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,452
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:00,372
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,142
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:22,728
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,648
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,817
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,320
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:36,867
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,704
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,414
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:46,043
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:46,960
Wait.

303
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:50,797
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,053
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,597
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,432
Arrest her.

307
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:01,516
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:08,732
Come here.

309
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,276
Now.

310
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:37,219
What's up?

311
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,638
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,806
Me?

313
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:44,059
For what?

314
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,938
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,068
All right.

316
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,332
Start the car!

317
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,382
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:17,551
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,220
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:22,430
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,154
Hey.

322
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:40,073
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,784
What?

324
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,619
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:47,038
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:47,622 --> 00:32:50,709
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:54,379
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:00,635
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,845
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,639
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,188
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:20,572
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:23,700
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:27,579
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,372
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,291
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,169
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:38,798
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,180
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:48,516
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,147
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:57,317
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,446
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,074
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,376
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:19,089
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,633
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:24,844
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,055
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,100
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,102
You bastards.

352
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,729
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:38,483
Explosives?

354
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:45,824
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:49,911
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:53,832
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:57,627
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:58,795 --> 00:34:59,754
You bastards!

359
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:04,634
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:07,595
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,599
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:15,812
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:16,730
One more thing.

364
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:21,818
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:24,821
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:26,364 --> 00:35:27,198
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,333
What?

368
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,626
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:43,548
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,306
We need to talk.

371
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:57,145
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:58,688
What?

373
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,901
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:06,112
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:08,323
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:12,702
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:15,830
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:18,708
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,460
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:23,254
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:24,923
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:30,929
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,308
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,935
Okay.

385
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:39,312
All right.

386
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:50,031
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:28,987
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,451
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,287
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,499
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:44,127
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:47,797
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:53,511
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,388
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:01,769
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:04,272
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:26,961
Hey.

398
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,925
Hey!

399
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,389
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:39,933
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:43,728
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:45,855
Stop!

403
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:48,483
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:50,735
There must be something here.

405
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:53,947
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,281
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:57,951
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:00,370
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:02,539
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:05,333
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:08,253
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:10,838
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:12,507
I am not.

414
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,342
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,635
Escape?

416
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:19,305
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:25,562
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:27,397
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,983
I repeat.

420
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,276
Everyone

421
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,527
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,279
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:36,781
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,995
Wait!

425
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,210
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:52,589
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,133
My goodness.

428
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:57,635
What is it this time?

429
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,887
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:03,683
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,519
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:10,440
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:16,446
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:34,422
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:40,053
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,309
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,896
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,231
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:55,568
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,279
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,199
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:07,413
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:14,921
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,512
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:25,139
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,316
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:40,738 --> 00:41:42,031
Why are you

448
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:46,411
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:49,706
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:58,131
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,424
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:04,178
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:08,349
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,227
I don't…

455
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:15,773
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:21,195
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:24,240
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:28,911
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:30,079
I'll go back.

460
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:33,666
What?

461
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,418
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:40,590
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:42,467
Are you insane?

464
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:45,178
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,804
If I go back,

466
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,726
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:07,200
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:15,750
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,127
Wait.

470
00:43:18,836 --> 00:43:20,630
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,719
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,222
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:30,890
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:32,934
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:35,812
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:37,355
In the restroom?

477
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:39,607
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,537
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:56,040
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:58,835
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:01,879
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:04,757
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,812
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:21,983
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:23,693
You don't think?

486
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:25,611
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:26,612 --> 00:44:29,949
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:31,909
To be honest,

489
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:34,370
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:39,166
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,878
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:42,753 --> 00:44:44,797
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,425
but she did not.

494
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:49,802
What about your side?

495
00:44:54,682 --> 00:44:56,392
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:00,313
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:50,446
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,377
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:06,629
Last night,

500
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:08,381
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:13,552
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:15,096
I can't.

503
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:18,766
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,643
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:22,353
Come out here.

506
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:24,772
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,525
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:37,159
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:40,621
Ma'am.

510
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:58,055
Just a bite.

511
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:02,476
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,769
Put that away.

513
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:07,982
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:13,404
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:18,826
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:23,581
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,292
You can hear now.

518
00:47:27,585 --> 00:47:31,589
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:36,260
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:38,262
so we're done for.

521
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:46,729
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,023
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:51,692
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:51,776 --> 00:47:54,278
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:55,488
He will.

526
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:59,992
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:03,537
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:05,539
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:07,500
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,733
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:40,950
Damn it.

532
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:56,841
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:58,342 --> 00:48:59,677
Please--

534
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:09,436
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,190
This is your last task.

536
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:16,861
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:17,695 --> 00:49:18,779
Kill them all!

538
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:22,783
Only ten of you

539
00:49:22,867 --> 00:49:26,162
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:37,715
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,988
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:20,507 --> 00:50:21,800
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:23,510
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,062
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:34,104 --> 00:50:35,189
Attack him!

546
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,832
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,627
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:02,758
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:13,894
You little bastard.

550
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,356
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:26,407
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:27,908 --> 00:51:30,119
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:31,704
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,166
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:39,712 --> 00:51:42,131
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:45,259
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:46,427
The party…

558
00:51:49,263 --> 00:51:51,974
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:55,227
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,896
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,190
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:06,613
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:19,960
Ever since then,

564
00:52:21,086 --> 00:52:24,465
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,008
Then

566
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:29,303
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:29,595 --> 00:52:32,973
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:35,642
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,644
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:38,312 --> 00:52:40,939
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:43,067
Remember.

572
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,652
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:49,531
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:51,742
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:55,162
kill him.

576
00:52:56,914 --> 00:52:58,415
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,377
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:04,004
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:07,591
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:29,154
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:35,285
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:38,997
Don't worry.

583
00:53:40,332 --> 00:53:42,376
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:45,295
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:49,550
You told the party?

586
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,263
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,850
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:00,602
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:03,439
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:14,616
Our plan

591
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,620
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:20,622
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,918
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:27,713
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:28,547 --> 00:54:30,466
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:31,800
Sit down.

597
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:35,929
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:40,142
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:45,063
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:49,276
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:50,444 --> 00:54:51,695
From now on,

602
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:53,197
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:53,864 --> 00:54:55,741
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:58,911
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:01,079
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:02,664
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:05,209
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,460
I told you.

609
00:55:06,543 --> 00:55:07,836
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,047
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,090
I have that radio.

612
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:15,385
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:20,891
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,686
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:27,147
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,608
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:30,943
Hey.

618
00:55:31,026 --> 00:55:33,529
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,656
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:37,699
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:42,996
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:43,747 --> 00:55:46,083
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,128
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:52,881
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:55,092
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:57,886 --> 00:55:58,929
Quiet.

627
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,722
Quiet!

628
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:03,725
Hold on.

629
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:07,104
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:10,732
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:10,816 --> 00:56:12,401
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:14,236
Is this why?

633
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:18,365
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:21,326
is all true.

635
00:56:23,495 --> 00:56:24,830
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:26,248
What?

637
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:27,708
So it's true?

638
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:31,128
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:35,424
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,551
Wiretap?

641
00:56:37,634 --> 00:56:39,177
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:41,138
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:44,516
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:49,438
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:50,564 --> 00:56:51,565
I'm sure…

646
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:56,987
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:57,988 --> 00:56:59,239
I see.

648
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:01,700
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:03,493
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,454
Was it?

651
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:07,414
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:08,373 --> 00:57:10,042
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,712
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:18,425
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:25,140
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:35,609
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:39,363
One more step forward,

658
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,949
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:51,249
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,252
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:58,465
She is not!

662
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,681
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,350
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:12,145
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,401
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,404
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:23,198
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:24,533
That damn b****.

669
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,618
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:28,078 --> 00:58:31,039
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:33,959
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,877
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:37,921
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:39,923
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:38,231
This money…

676
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:40,233
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:40,942 --> 00:59:42,736
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:45,155
and use her

679
00:59:45,864 --> 00:59:47,616
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:53,330
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:57,793
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:02,172
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,549
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:08,220
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:11,056
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:18,271
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:21,149
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:22,692 --> 01:00:26,530
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:26,696 --> 01:00:29,115
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:34,913
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:34,996 --> 01:00:38,291
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:41,795
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:41,878 --> 01:00:44,005
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:48,134
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:50,387 --> 01:00:52,931
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:57,727
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:57,811 --> 01:00:59,229
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:08,572
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:14,536
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:21,042
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:22,168 --> 01:01:24,254
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:40,228
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:44,774
December 3.

704
01:01:45,859 --> 01:01:47,068
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:48,236 --> 01:01:49,905
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:51,656 --> 01:01:53,700
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:58,538
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:58,622 --> 01:02:00,665
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:10,258
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:10,342 --> 01:02:13,345
On December 5.

711
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:16,097
What?

712
01:02:16,848 --> 01:02:18,850
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:21,186
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:28,818
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:30,362
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:37,118 --> 01:02:38,328
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:40,038
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:41,623
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:46,086
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:46,169 --> 01:02:49,005
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:53,927
Is this bastard

722
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:57,555
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:01,434
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:01,518 --> 01:03:04,813
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,273
Su-hui?

726
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,819
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,697
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,324
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:19,953 --> 01:03:21,746
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:28,294
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:32,382
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:33,717
We should.

733
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:38,263
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:42,267
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:43,893 --> 01:03:45,603
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:49,274
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:51,693
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:54,195
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:56,156
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:57,824
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:57,907 --> 01:03:59,743
I said one sentence.

742
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:01,703
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:01,786 --> 01:04:02,912
Among us?

744
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:23,224
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:25,977
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:29,606 --> 01:04:32,484
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:32,609 --> 01:04:34,861
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:00,845
Anything unusual?

749
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,263
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,641
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:05,016 --> 01:05:06,392
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,020
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:11,523
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,483
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:19,030
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:22,867
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:07,453
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:38,860
Hello?

759
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:48,036
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:53,291
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:57,754 --> 01:07:00,256
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:07,263
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:09,682
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:11,392
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:28,284 --> 01:07:29,911
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:34,123
These innocent students…

767
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,752
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:39,796
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:41,256
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,007
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:45,969
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:46,052 --> 01:07:48,137
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:50,181
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:53,518
My father was

775
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:56,604
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:58,731 --> 01:08:02,652
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:03,361 --> 01:08:04,988
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:10,368
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:13,788
So I ran away.

780
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:18,835
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:21,587
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:24,340
I wandered around.

783
01:08:25,842 --> 01:08:27,760
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:31,723
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:38,521
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:48,573
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:53,286
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:13,139 --> 01:09:15,141
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:25,276
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:26,944
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:36,496 --> 01:09:37,955
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:43,294
I have no idea.

793
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:48,800
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:48,883 --> 01:09:50,301
I'm not it!

795
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:51,219
Lady.

796
01:09:51,594 --> 01:09:53,721
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:55,723
Stop it!

798
01:09:57,141 --> 01:09:58,059
Look.

799
01:09:58,142 --> 01:10:00,478
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:04,190
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:07,819
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:07,902 --> 01:10:11,239
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:11,322 --> 01:10:15,493
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:16,452 --> 01:10:19,914
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:21,541
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:26,546 --> 01:10:28,172
She's from the North.

807
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:31,175
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:34,303
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:34,637 --> 01:10:36,931
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,935
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:46,649
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:50,111
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:59,245 --> 01:11:00,788
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:04,876
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:05,626 --> 01:11:07,336
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:09,172 --> 01:11:11,215
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:17,305
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,309
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:21,392 --> 01:11:23,144
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:24,228
It's so scary.

821
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:28,149
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:30,193
Anyway,

823
01:11:31,277 --> 01:11:34,489
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:35,072 --> 01:11:38,951
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,003
It's so scary.

826
01:12:20,743 --> 01:12:22,078
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:24,121
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:27,792
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:30,294
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:36,217
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:40,846
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:52,692
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:55,194 --> 01:12:59,031
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:55,379 --> 01:13:58,382
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:59,675 --> 01:14:01,844
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:05,222
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,855
I will

838
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,067
go meet my father.

839
01:14:18,861 --> 01:14:21,072
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:25,660
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:30,498
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:33,959
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:34,043 --> 01:14:37,672
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:39,632 --> 01:14:42,635
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:43,761 --> 01:14:46,681
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:48,057 --> 01:14:51,102
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:53,312
Let me do this.

848
01:14:54,188 --> 01:14:55,272
Please?

849
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:24,051
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:24,135 --> 01:15:26,554
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:26,762 --> 01:15:29,598
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,184
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:32,268 --> 01:15:33,436
Quiet!

854
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:37,148
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:45,698 --> 01:15:46,615
Hello?

856
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:49,034
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:49,452 --> 01:15:52,246
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:54,498
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,585
You must come alone.

860
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:10,931
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:11,724 --> 01:16:14,393
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:16,604
We have no choice.

863
01:16:18,898 --> 01:16:22,693
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:42,296 --> 01:16:45,591
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:49,136
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:52,264
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:54,016
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:04,443 --> 01:17:05,986
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:06,445 --> 01:17:08,197
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,699
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,118
We must kill him.

872
01:17:14,203 --> 01:17:15,704
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,002
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:22,086 --> 01:17:23,254
Over and out.

875
01:18:21,937 --> 01:18:23,314
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:49,048
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:07,566 --> 01:19:09,234
Are you all right?

878
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:13,822
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:19,536 --> 01:19:20,746
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:26,585 --> 01:19:29,421
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:38,097 --> 01:19:39,098
Dad.

882
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:40,766
Yes?

883
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:47,898
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:48,524 --> 01:19:52,277
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:54,571
Please stop it.

886
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:58,867
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:58,951 --> 01:20:00,160
What are you talking about?

888
01:20:00,911 --> 01:20:02,913
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:02,997 --> 01:20:05,833
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:08,043
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:15,926 --> 01:20:19,805
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:21,932 --> 01:20:23,517
Please save us.

893
01:20:25,978 --> 01:20:27,563
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:30,774
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:32,192
Don't move.

896
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,614
And my brother…

897
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,617
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:42,536 --> 01:20:45,247
died because of me.

899
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,507
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:57,718 --> 01:20:59,219
I won't be able to…

901
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:01,388
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:02,389 --> 01:21:03,474
Please…

903
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:07,478
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:11,648
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:12,983
Don't move!

906
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,116
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,958
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:37,633 --> 01:21:39,009
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:49,394
No!

910
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:17,089
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:19,758 --> 01:22:20,676
Come in!

912
01:22:20,759 --> 01:22:22,094
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:23,595
Move back!

914
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:24,972
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:27,224 --> 01:22:29,059
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:32,729
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,499
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:54,835
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:56,795
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:56,879 --> 01:22:58,755
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:58,839 --> 01:23:01,258
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:01,341 --> 01:23:03,135
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:03,218 --> 01:23:05,554
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:05,637 --> 01:23:08,265
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:08,348 --> 01:23:10,142
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:10,225 --> 01:23:12,186
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:12,269 --> 01:23:13,312
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:13,395 --> 01:23:15,147
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:20,777
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:22,654
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:23,989
What do we do now?

932
01:23:24,072 --> 01:23:27,034
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:30,037
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:32,206
What if they really

935
01:23:33,749 --> 01:23:36,501
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:39,296 --> 01:23:42,090
BONUS

937
01:23:42,174 --> 01:23:45,177
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:48,013 --> 01:23:52,684
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
