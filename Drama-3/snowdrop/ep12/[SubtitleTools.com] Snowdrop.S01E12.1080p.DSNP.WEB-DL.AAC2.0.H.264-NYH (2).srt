EPISODE 12

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,676
ON AIR

4
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,845
Kids, cameras are over there.

5
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:30,055
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

6
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:32,349
-It's a rabbit!
-It's a rabbit!

7
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,726
-Hi, Rabbit.
-Hey.

8
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,185
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

9
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,478
-Where are you going?
-Where?

10
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,480
-What?
-He's leaving.

11
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,482
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

12
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,068
-Where are you going?
-Rabbit!

NEWSROOM CHIEF'S OFFICE

14
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:09,094
NEWSROOM CHIEF

15
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,494
Mr. Lee, do you copy?

16
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,162
Mr. Lee.

17
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,373
Hey. Have you delivered all?

18
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,584
Yes, to six newspapers
and two TV stations.

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,546
Good job. Stay safe.

20
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,849
A newspaper or a TV station,
just one of them needs to cover it.

21
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,774
About Kang Cheong-ya…

22
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,944
Well, what do you think of her?

23
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,783
She seems to be wavering,

24
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,703
but how can we trust her?

25
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,253
Leave her to me.

26
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,758
Would you like some hot tea?

27
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,511
As I thought…

28
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,602
It was my father, wasn't it?

29
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:19,112
If you believe
his order to kill me is right…

30
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,419
kill me now.

31
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,634
Director Lim Ji-rok of the UFD…

32
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,055
is your father?

33
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:08,370
GREAT SUPREME LEADER KIM IL-SUNG…

34
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:09,788
Comrade Director!

35
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,463
We got this message
from Hosu University dorm last night.

36
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,805
SENDER: HAEGEUMSEONG 1

37
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:30,350
TAEDONG RIVER 1 BETRAYED, JOINED HANDS
WITH LEE GANG-MU, TRYING TO RUIN OPERATION

38
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,769
The apple never falls far from the tree.

39
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,814
He's indeed a son of a reactionary.

40
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,696
Don't tell Deputy Director Choi Su-ryeon.

41
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,282
Understood, Comrade Director.

42
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,255
Why don't you eat something
and get some sleep?

43
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,804
I may have decided not to kill you,

44
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,390
but don't trust me too much.

45
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:15,520
Because the party still trusts me.

46
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:18,357
Do you believe

47
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,943
your life is yours?

48
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:33,121
It's the life the party planned out
for you. It's not the life you chose.

49
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,041
Stop living as Kang Cheong-ya
or Moran Hill 1.

50
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,461
Live as your real name.

51
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:44,841
Tonight,

52
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,303
I'll help you get out through the shrine
without anyone knowing.

53
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:52,474
Escape here while Nam Tae-il
still believes you're locked in here.

54
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,105
And leave for another country.

55
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,400
That's your only way out.

56
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,360
Now that…

57
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,703
you've disobeyed the party's orders,

58
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:19,459
going to another country is
your only way out too, isn't it?

59
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,801
I'm sure you already know

60
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,971
that I can't do that.

61
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,738
You got the accounts for the secret funds?

62
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,741
There's not much time.
Get 300 million dollars ready by today.

63
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,370
I will after telling the President.

64
00:10:57,873 --> 00:11:00,459
Are you saying you'll disobey my orders?

65
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,837
Disobey? Of course not.

66
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:05,338
I'm just saying

67
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:08,467
I was appointed as new chief
of the OPC just a few hours ago,

68
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,428
so I'm afraid I can't withdraw
such a huge amount of money

69
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,555
without the President knowing.

70
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:17,100
I told you,
you can just put it as working expenses.

71
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,939
If it won't be a problem,
why is it top secret

72
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,400
and why must it be kept
between you and me?

73
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,820
And why can I not ask
the President for approval?

74
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:32,657
Before I have answers to those questions,

75
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,286
I can't withdraw
such a huge sum of money just like that.

76
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,496
An!

77
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,961
I mean, Chief An.

78
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:50,050
That money will be sent
to the North in a week anyway.

79
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,969
The President is also aware of it.
I'm just…

80
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,765
sending it a little early. That's all.

81
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,184
All right, sir.

82
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,647
I'll try my best to get approval
from the President and have it--

83
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,564
Hey!

84
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:13,114
God, what an inflexible punk.

85
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:18,203
This is Eun Chang-su.

86
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:21,831
Your agent who's being
held hostage in the dorm

87
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:24,209
is persistently ruining our plan.

88
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,880
It seems he's convinced Lim Soo-ho
to turn the dorm into some haven.

89
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:33,009
Are you saying Lim Soo-ho has joined
hands with Lee Gang-mu?

90
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:38,098
It seems those two are trying
to ruin the election scheme together.

91
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:42,269
I got a message that they already started
carrying out their plan to ruin it.

92
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,729
Plan to ruin it?

93
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:50,068
I understand. I'll see what we can do.

94
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,447
He got a message?

95
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,534
But who sent it from the dorm?

96
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,499
You can take your time
to get 300 million ready.

97
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,712
Are you going to the scene, sir?

98
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:19,973
That damn bastard!
He joined hands with a communist?

99
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,683
When he came out,

100
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:24,060
we should've just shot him to death!

101
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:27,897
We should jam radio signals first.

102
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:31,318
Hurry up with the jamming
so that no one can contact anyone inside.

103
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:33,445
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

104
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,322
There's someone spying for us inside.

105
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:36,990
That's not important right now.

106
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:40,368
We need them if we want to know
what's going on inside--

107
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,204
That reminds me.

108
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,957
The dorm's telephone operator
tried to tell me

109
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,751
something about Soo-ho and Gang-mu.

110
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:51,254
I think she was trying to say
they joined hands.

111
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,340
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

112
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:54,257
When was it?

113
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:57,802
-Before we got the camcorder?
-Yes, before that.

114
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,722
Then the students probably found out
it's an election scheme.

115
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,141
You're right. I think they did.

116
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:06,895
No wonder they didn't seem scared
laughing and chatting. What do we do now?

117
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,313
What do you think?

118
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,524
We should kill them all.

119
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,610
Bring in the EOD team

120
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,362
and plant bombs all over the dorm.

121
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,447
We'll blow them all up if need be.

122
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,907
Blow them up?

123
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:21,409
Even if we use high-capacity bombs,

124
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,286
we can't guarantee they'll be all killed.

125
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,414
Send in the SWAT team
and rescue my daughter first.

126
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,417
Then send in an EOD specialist
to plant bombs

127
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,252
and make sure they kill them all.

128
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,797
More than 30 people will die.

129
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,007
So we must make it look
like it's the spies' doing.

130
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,842
So that there won't be any controversy.

131
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,011
So that we'll be able to win the election!

132
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:43,973
-Choi.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:49,187
Hey.

134
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,041
Gye Bun-ok.

135
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,003
Gye Bun-ok! Open the door.

136
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,567
You can't just barge into my room!

137
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:44,993
Where's the radio? Give it to me.

138
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,164
The ANSP guy took it,
so go ask him to give it back.

139
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,210
Don't do anything stupid again.

140
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,213
We're trying
to get all of us out of here alive.

141
00:15:57,297 --> 00:16:01,593
So don't try to survive alone
or play any tricks.

142
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,970
That's rich coming from you.

143
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:08,725
Didn't you hide the radio away
to save your own skin?

144
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,440
Bun-ok.

145
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:20,069
If you keep being this way,
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

146
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:22,530
Protect me?

147
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:27,285
You ordered me around, looked down on me,
and used me. You call that protecting?

148
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,162
Is that why you pulled the trigger?

149
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,585
You didn't know it was unloaded?
How stupid.

150
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:40,340
Did that doctor promise
to save your father?

151
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,760
She gave you an unloaded gun
because she didn't trust you.

152
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:46,513
She's the one who looked down on you
and used you!

153
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,890
Understand?

154
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,014
Don't you find Ms. Pi strange?

155
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,850
Why is she like that to Gizzard?

156
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,769
Tell me about it.
I thought she'd drag her out right away.

157
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,564
"I don't need
to be supervised by you, do I?"

158
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,067
Yet she couldn't say anything
to that arrogant wench.

159
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,070
Yeong-ro, do you know anything about it?

160
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,990
You said Ms. Pi knows
Bun-ok threatened us with a gun.

161
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,533
-Yes, you did.
-Right.

162
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,118
Well…

163
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:55,290
She saw Bun-ok pointing

164
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,584
a gun at me.

165
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,752
-Even at you?
-But she and you were very close.

166
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:04,257
Guys, I think
Bun-ok has something big on Ms. Pi.

167
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,596
When I was singing in the cafeteria,

168
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:14,142
I saw Ms. Pi and the ANSP guy
whispering and found it weird.

169
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:15,560
Maybe…

170
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,148
Gizzard caught them kissing secretly.

171
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,065
Hey.

172
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:22,901
Come on.

173
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,277
What?

174
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:29,282
Who knows?
Being in this kind of crisis together

175
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,451
made them think it was love

176
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,369
and kiss.

177
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:35,038
No one but you would do that.

178
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,707
The ANSP might be trying
to kill us out there.

179
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,209
But what? The ANSP guy and Ms. Pi kissing?

180
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,546
By the way,

181
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,549
is the ANSP really going to kill us all?

182
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,053
They even shot innocent people to death
to win the election.

183
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,429
They're capable of anything.

184
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:54,390
Hey! I don't think
they're crazy enough to kill us

185
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:55,725
to win the election.

186
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:58,019
The Director must be crazy enough.

187
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:00,730
-I'm so scared.
-So am I.

188
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:08,071
Why do you look so down?
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:12,241
I have an upset stomach.

190
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,828
An upset stomach? All you had today
is a bowl of cup noodles.

191
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:18,831
You're right.
Is it the chicken you had last night?

192
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,375
Do you want some medicine?

193
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,634
I'm fine.

194
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,221
I need to go to the restroom.

195
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,311
But will they really kill us
to regain power?

196
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,105
Are you serious?

197
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,232
You still don't know
what they're really like?

198
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,194
Anyway, we need to find a way to survive.

199
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:50,238
How? Anything in your mind?

200
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,323
I'll think about it from now on.

201
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:53,908
Gosh…

202
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:04,479
What did you pray for so hard?

203
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,835
I prayed that we'll get out of here safely

204
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:32,423
and you'll get to see your sister

205
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:37,762
and live a normal, free life

206
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:42,433
like other guys your age.

207
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,686
I prayed for that.

208
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,046
I promise

209
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,508
I'll keep you safe.

210
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,434
Everyone including your friends

211
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:28,271
will be all right.

212
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,152
At the next Open House,

213
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:38,406
we should play fun games
and dance together.

214
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:39,949
Right?

215
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,666
But Soo-ho,

216
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,128
who will keep you safe then?

217
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:01,012
Don't worry. You know I'm like Superman.

218
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:15,067
You can't even fly.

219
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,476
Charlotte?

220
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:55,024
Look who's here.

221
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,904
Didn't you say you didn't take
what the fortuneteller said seriously?

222
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:03,866
But you ran over here
as soon as you buried your son.

223
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,118
I never imagined it'd be possible

224
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:09,789
for 13 people to be killed
unless war broke out.

225
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,210
But ever since
the hostage situation began,

226
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:19,257
I've been getting the feeling
that exactly 13 people will die.

227
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:24,595
Aren't you also here
because you're worried about that?

228
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,266
You just lost your child. How could you…

229
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,726
It's not that I didn't know,

230
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,272
but you're indeed cold-hearted.

231
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:40,403
Oh, right.

232
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,199
Are you aware
that An has become the Chief of the OPC?

233
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:54,166
It seems Mr. Eun also didn't know
that An was going to be appointed.

234
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,088
He had no idea one of his subordinates
was loved by the President.

235
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:03,009
He might end up
getting stabbed in the back at this rate.

236
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:09,056
The ANSP is not required

237
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,477
to disclose the details of the budget to
the Ministry of Finance or the Assembly.

238
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,896
But they keep all the money in the bank

239
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,024
and receive a puny interest.

240
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:20,151
I think it's such a shame.

241
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,988
Pray with all your heart
and pick out a few companies to invest in.

242
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,116
I'm sure
the deity will give you directions.

243
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,284
Oh, my.

244
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:33,414
My goodness. Thank you so much.

245
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,002
Well, when I come to see you next time,

246
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,589
I should get you a new car key.

247
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,429
Hello, sir!

248
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,438
You must have a strong stomach.

249
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:00,066
Have you two made up already?

250
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:03,361
Why don't you just go
if you're done with him?

251
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:08,240
If I'd known in advance,
I would've sent you some flowers.

252
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:11,327
The President gave my husband
a bouquet when he appointed him.

253
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:14,997
And that's more than enough.

254
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,103
You came to ask me
if 13 people will really die, didn't you?

255
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,272
Oh, my goodness!

256
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:42,858
How did you know? You're so good!

257
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:46,695
So you want me
to ask the deity about it for you?

258
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,283
Let's see…

259
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:06,757
Here. Pick one.

260
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,884
There's only one question,

261
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:11,053
so it's okay for only one of you to pick.

262
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,763
Who'll pick first?

263
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:22,565
I outrank you, don't I?

264
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,361
It's about the Gonyeo Eun Clan.
I should do it.

265
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,947
You've just been bereaved. It's bad luck.

266
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:35,035
I've had it. How dare you, you wench!

267
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:36,078
Hey!

268
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:41,500
What was that? How dare you do that
in the presence of the deity?

269
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:50,551
It doesn't matter who picks first.

270
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:54,638
It could turn into bad luck
depending on what you pick.

271
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:13,073
It's very auspicious.

272
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:17,161
Your wishes will come true.

273
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:18,746
-My wishes?
-My wishes?

274
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,877
Everything will go as you wish.

275
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,712
-As who wishes?
-As who wishes?

276
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:31,592
The deity always

277
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,553
helps the more desperate one.

278
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:40,351
It means everything depends
on your sincerity and effort.

279
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,354
My goodness. Then,

280
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,147
should I do some rites?

281
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:47,691
You think rites work every time?

282
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,336
Once you're done
setting up the bombs, radio me.

283
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:19,765
We have set up bombs
all around the dorm. Over.

284
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:27,356
Park Mu-yeol,
the Aemin Party's candidate, said

285
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:32,319
he won't condone the spies' hostage-taking
and will prevent the North's provocations

286
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,114
expected to happen before the Olympics.

287
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:40,035
To hold the Seoul Olympics successfully

288
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,872
and make the whole world
remember it forever…

289
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,297
I doubt TV stations
gave up on such a scoop.

290
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,549
I think something went wrong.

291
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,052
Breaking news, my foot.

292
00:29:58,262 --> 00:29:59,972
Nothing related to it is being covered.

293
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,742
Arrest Jang Han-na.

294
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:22,328
Arrest Han-na?

295
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,248
I wondered why a veteran agent like Soo-ho

296
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,417
decided to betray his country.
This was it.

297
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:31,920
Did you forget about the agreement?

298
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:36,467
We agreed to killing all the spies.

299
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,304
Reporter Gal must've recorded this.

300
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,014
Soo-ho must have listened to this.

301
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:45,643
They started trying to ruin our plan
by sending this out to TV stations.

302
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:46,560
Wait.

303
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:50,397
They're inside the dorm. How did they--

304
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,653
Jang Han-na?

305
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:58,197
No wonder they kept asking for her.

306
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,032
Arrest her.

307
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:01,116
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:08,332
Come here.

309
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:10,876
Now.

310
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:36,819
What's up?

311
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:39,238
Mr. Eun wants to see you.

312
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:40,406
Me?

313
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:43,659
For what?

314
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:47,538
Well, you'll know when you see him.

315
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,668
All right.

316
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,932
Start the car!

317
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:14,982
I'm sure
they're watching all the entrances.

318
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,151
But they can't cover all the windows.

319
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:19,820
But we don't know
which windows they're watching.

320
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:22,030
We can't just test it out.

321
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:36,754
Hey.

322
00:32:36,837 --> 00:32:39,673
Is it the recording tape
that makes you this reckless?

323
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,384
What?

324
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:44,219
Didn't you learn you'd be awarded

325
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:46,638
the Hero of the Republic
if you died for your country?

326
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:50,309
If you die, your family will live well.

327
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:53,979
So why did you change your mind
and make things more complicated?

328
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:00,235
Stop talking nonsense
and cut to the chase.

329
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,445
Cut to the chase?

330
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,239
Let me talk to Gang-mu.

331
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,788
Put that communist bastard on the phone!

332
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:20,172
You'll accuse me of being a communist?

333
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:23,300
That makes you a true communist.

334
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:27,179
You schemed with the high-ups of the North
to win the election.

335
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:28,972
Am I wrong?

336
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:30,891
Listen to this guy.

337
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:33,769
You're really something
just like they say.

338
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:38,398
If you're being like that,
I'm going to have to kill you.

339
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,780
Listen carefully.

340
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:48,116
Bombs have been set up
all around the dorm.

341
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,747
How dare a mere pawn like you

342
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,917
try to ruin the scheme for the election?

343
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,046
If you try anything funny,
I'll blow the dorm up.

344
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:03,674
I'll blow all of you to bits.

345
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,976
Soo-ho, you heard him, right?

346
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:18,689
He's threatening to blow the whole dorm
to bits. You think that's possible?

347
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:21,233
The explosive power will be dispersed.

348
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,444
Yes, you're right.

349
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:26,655
To completely destroy a building,

350
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,700
you must install bombs
on pillars inside it.

351
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,702
You bastards.

352
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,329
We've set up high-capacity explosives!

353
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,083
Explosives?

354
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:45,424
Then the sound of the explosion
will be really big. That's good.

355
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:49,511
Even kids will know
the bombs exploded outside the dorm.

356
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:53,432
Then people will find out
it's an election scheme without our help.

357
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:57,227
You know, people in Seoul are quite smart.

358
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,354
You bastards!

359
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:04,234
Gang-mu.

360
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,195
This is Eun Chang-su.

361
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,199
We collected all of the recording tapes
that had been sent to the press.

362
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:15,412
Didn't you know our agents were stationed
at all of the newspapers and TV stations?

363
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:16,330
One more thing.

364
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,418
If you're worried about the safety
of Jang Han-na, your messenger,

365
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:24,421
you'd better not do anything from now on.

366
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:26,798
Mr. Eun…

367
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:35,933
What?

368
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:38,226
You set up bombs?

369
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:43,148
Only to use them to threaten the spies.

370
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,906
We need to talk.

371
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:56,745
We could just talk inside.
Why did you have to make me come out?

372
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,288
What?

373
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:02,501
Should I pull the trigger?

374
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:05,712
I lost my beloved son,
and my daughter is in there.

375
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,923
You think I have anything to fear?

376
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:12,302
Listen. I don't intend
to set them off anytime soon.

377
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:15,430
As you know, Dr. Kang is in there.
She's my doctor.

378
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:18,308
We must send in the SWAT team secretly.

379
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,060
But you told them about the bombs?

380
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,854
When we rescue your daughter,

381
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,523
we must get Dr. Kang out too.

382
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,529
This is your last warning.

383
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,908
We must rescue my daughter first.
No matter what.

384
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,535
Okay.

385
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:38,912
All right.

386
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:49,631
That damn bastard…

387
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,587
-Move your car!
-Move it!

388
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,051
Our plan was leaked.

389
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,887
It means we have a mole inside the dorm.

390
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:41,099
Except you, I, and Yeong-ro,

391
00:37:41,683 --> 00:37:43,727
we can't trust anyone in here.

392
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:47,397
If they've set up bombs,

393
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:53,111
Eun Chang-su might send in the SWAT team
to rescue Yeong-ro tonight.

394
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:54,988
We must find the mole before that.

395
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:01,369
I'll gather the hostages in the prayer
room. Take care of the southern side.

396
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:03,872
I'll watch Comrade Kang and my guys.

397
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:26,561
Hey.

398
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,525
Hey!

399
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:37,989
-Wait.
-What?

400
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:39,533
This side isn't blocked.

401
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:43,328
-Lead the way.
-Wait, stop.

402
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,455
Stop!

403
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,083
We're up against
an ANSP team leader and a spy.

404
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,335
There must be something here.

405
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:53,547
I'm sure this is a trap.

406
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,881
How is this a trap?

407
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,551
But I don't see any trap here.

408
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,970
Hye-ryeong.

409
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,139
There are invisible booby traps too.

410
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:04,933
Depending on how you set them up,

411
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:07,853
-there are many various types.
-Hey.

412
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:10,438
Don't lie.
You're chickening out, aren't you?

413
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:12,107
I am not.

414
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,942
Are you going to escape or not?

415
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:15,235
Escape?

416
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:18,905
-How can I escape like this?
-Let's escape!

417
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:25,162
Everyone in the dormitory,

418
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,997
gather in the prayer room now.

419
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,583
I repeat.

420
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,876
Everyone

421
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,127
in the dormitory,

422
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,879
gather in the prayer room now.

423
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:36,381
…to carry out our duties…

424
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,595
Wait!

425
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:48,810
Let's go to the prayer room.

426
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,189
Hey, let's go.

427
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,733
My goodness.

428
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,235
What is it this time?

429
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,487
At the moment, agent Lee Gang-mu,

430
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:03,283
the ANSP team leader,
is being held hostage in the dorm.

431
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,119
He is a veteran agent
experienced in anti-communism,

432
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm sure he's trying his best
to save the students from the spies.

433
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:16,046
With our good agent Lee Gang-mu,
we will save the hostages no matter--

434
00:40:32,354 --> 00:40:34,022
I spoke with Nam Tae-il on the phone.

435
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,653
He already knew
Gang-mu and I had joined hands.

436
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:45,909
No wonder
they're bringing up Gang-mu on TV.

437
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:49,496
They must've decided to kill him.

438
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,831
He'll be killed later anyway.

439
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:55,168
If people think
he's died saving the hostages,

440
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,879
they'll think highly of the ANSP.

441
00:40:57,963 --> 00:41:00,799
They also know about our plan
to ruin the election scheme.

442
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,013
They even set up bombs around the dorm.

443
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,521
Are you suspecting me?

444
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,112
I want to give you
a chance to live a new life.

445
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:24,739
But if you've betrayed me…

446
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,916
one of us two must die.

447
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,631
Why are you

448
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:46,011
dying to save the South Koreans
who have nothing to do with us?

449
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:49,306
Because of Yeong-ro?

450
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,731
You'll never end up with her.
You know that.

451
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,024
Yeong-ro…

452
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,778
paid too harsh a price for me.

453
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:07,949
All she did is risking her life
to save my life and helping me.

454
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:10,827
I don't…

455
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:15,373
want her to suffer anymore.

456
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,795
So what on earth is your plan?

457
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:23,840
Let's say you get out of here alive.
What's next?

458
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:28,511
You must think about what's next.

459
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:29,679
I'll go back.

460
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:33,266
What?

461
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,018
If I don't go back,

462
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:40,190
my sister Su-hui will be killed.

463
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:42,067
Are you insane?

464
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:44,778
You think Lim Ji-rok will let you live?

465
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,404
If I go back,

466
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:51,326
he'll let Su-hui live.

467
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,800
You must bear with it
until we catch the mole.

468
00:43:12,305 --> 00:43:15,350
All right. Everyone is here, right?

469
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:17,727
Wait.

470
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,230
I don't see Ms. Oh.

471
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,319
Ms. Pi, have you seen Ms. Oh?

472
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,822
You slept with her last night.

473
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,490
I saw her in the morning.

474
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:32,534
Has anyone seen her since then?

475
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:35,412
I saw her not long ago
in the restroom on the second floor.

476
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:36,955
In the restroom?

477
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,207
Ma'am, I'll go.

478
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,137
It's an emergency.

479
00:43:53,054 --> 00:43:55,640
All of you should stay here.
That's the safest.

480
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:58,435
So don't leave the room until I get back.

481
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:01,479
An emergency? What's going on?

482
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:04,357
I'll tell you after finding Ms. Oh.

483
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,412
What did Cheong-ya say?

484
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,583
I don't think it's her.

485
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,293
You don't think?

486
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:25,211
Did you question her right?

487
00:44:26,212 --> 00:44:29,549
She even got a big shot like Nam Tae-il.
She wouldn't change her mind easily.

488
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:31,509
To be honest,

489
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:33,970
I suspect her the most.

490
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:38,766
If she'd sent the message,

491
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,478
she would've killed me this morning.

492
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:44,397
She did have the chance,

493
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,025
but she did not.

494
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:49,402
What about your side?

495
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:55,992
Ms. Oh disappeared.

496
00:44:58,703 --> 00:44:59,913
Ms. Oh did?

497
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:50,046
What are you doing here?

498
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,977
Someone stole chickens.

499
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,229
Last night,

500
00:46:06,312 --> 00:46:07,981
someone stole chickens.

501
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,152
Come out here. Now.

502
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:14,696
I can't.

503
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:18,366
Those who steal food are the worst.

504
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:20,243
Wait until I catch them. I'll…

505
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:21,953
Come out here.

506
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:24,372
But I need to put them back in here.

507
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:27,125
Or they will thaw.

508
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:36,759
But I must guard the kitchen.

509
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:40,221
Ma'am.

510
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:57,655
Just a bite.

511
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,076
Chicken from the South is really good.

512
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,369
Put that away.

513
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:07,582
-Just a bite.
-Put that away, you bastard!

514
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,004
Comrade Joo.

515
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:18,426
Do you have a death wish?

516
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:23,181
You must've had a good night's sleep.

517
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,892
You can hear now.

518
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:31,189
I understand how you feel.
But surviving is most important right now.

519
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:35,860
Our team leader's betrayed the country,

520
00:47:36,361 --> 00:47:37,862
so we're done for.

521
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:46,329
Didn't you hear our country
and the South are scheming to kill us?

522
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,623
I trust Comrade Lim.

523
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:51,292
He's trying to save our lives at all cost.

524
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,878
Our country decided to kill us,
so how will he save us?

525
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:55,088
He will.

526
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:59,592
I believe Comrade Lim is going to save us.

527
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,137
Have you forgotten

528
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:05,139
he saved the dying comrades

529
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,100
on Mount Puksubaek?

530
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,333
Pick up the pace!

531
00:48:39,424 --> 00:48:40,550
Damn it.

532
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:56,441
-Please spare us!
-Save us!

533
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:59,277
Please--

534
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:09,036
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

535
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:12,790
This is your last task.

536
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,461
Those who couldn't kill the traitors…

537
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:18,379
Kill them all!

538
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:22,383
Only ten of you

539
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:25,762
will become warriors
who will make our republic proud.

540
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,315
Comrade Geum-cheol…

541
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,588
Didn't you hear my order?

542
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:21,400
Lim Soo-hyeok!

543
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:23,110
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,662
What are you doing, Eung-cheol?

545
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:34,789
Attack him!

546
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,432
Lim Soo-hyeok.

547
00:50:54,308 --> 00:50:56,227
I know what your order means.

548
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:02,358
But I can't kill him.

549
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,494
You little bastard.

550
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,956
Are you disobeying the party?

551
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:26,007
I will kill as many traitors
as you want me to.

552
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:29,719
But the person you're ordering me to kill

553
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:31,304
is a warrior of our country.

554
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,766
Everyone here is my comrade
who survived the hellish training with me!

555
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,731
Don't you know how important it is
to be mentally armed?

556
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:44,859
When the party orders you,
you must obey without question!

557
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,027
The party…

558
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,574
would never order us to kill our comrades.

559
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:54,827
The party cherishes
every one of its people!

560
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:57,496
It would never abandon
warriors of the Republic

561
00:51:58,205 --> 00:51:59,790
who finished the harsh training!

562
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:06,213
TRAIN LIKE REAL COMBAT WITH THE SPIRIT
OF ANTI-JAPANESE GUERRILLAS…

563
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:19,560
Ever since then,

564
00:52:20,686 --> 00:52:24,065
he's always been likely
to betray our country.

565
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:25,608
Then

566
00:52:26,484 --> 00:52:28,903
why did the party not kill him?

567
00:52:29,195 --> 00:52:32,573
They punished the instructor
because they thought Lim was right.

568
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:35,242
Why did they not kill him?

569
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,244
Thanks to his father,

570
00:52:37,912 --> 00:52:40,539
he wasn't killed
even after disobeying the party.

571
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:42,667
Remember.

572
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,252
Lim Soo-ho
could commit treason any moment.

573
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:49,131
Watch him closely all the time,

574
00:52:49,215 --> 00:52:51,342
and if you sense
any change in his ideology,

575
00:52:53,552 --> 00:52:54,762
kill him.

576
00:52:56,514 --> 00:52:58,015
The party abandoned him.

577
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:00,977
And you abandoned your family for him?

578
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:03,604
If the party finds out you've turned,

579
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,191
all your family members will be taken
to the political prison camp.

580
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:28,754
Comrade Lim.

581
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:34,885
What'll happen to my family?

582
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:38,597
Don't worry.

583
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:41,976
I told the party
that I betrayed them alone.

584
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:44,895
So your family will be safe, Eung-cheol.

585
00:53:47,565 --> 00:53:49,150
You told the party?

586
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:53,863
The North must be aware anyway.

587
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,450
Someone informed them
I'd joined hands with Gang-mu.

588
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:00,202
Someone in the dorm.

589
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:03,039
There's a mole in here?

590
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,216
Our plan

591
00:54:15,676 --> 00:54:18,220
to let people know
about the election scheme.

592
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:20,222
The ANSP already knew about it.

593
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,518
Damn it. Who was it?

594
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:27,313
Who the hell told them?

595
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:30,066
Come clean.
I'll kill you when I catch you.

596
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,400
Sit down.

597
00:54:34,361 --> 00:54:35,529
Ms. Pi.

598
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:39,742
Is there any other walkie-talkie
in this dorm that I don't know about?

599
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,663
No. Not that I know of.

600
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:48,876
It's impossible
to contact someone outside without it.

601
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:51,295
From now on,

602
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:52,797
we'll search your rooms

603
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,341
where you slept last night.

604
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,511
-What? Why do they have to?
-Why?

605
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:00,679
-Searching our rooms?
-Why?

606
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:02,264
Are they suspecting us?

607
00:55:02,348 --> 00:55:04,809
-Searching our rooms?
-Is he suspecting us?

608
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:06,060
I told you.

609
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:07,436
The radio is Ms. Pi's.

610
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,647
Why are you not suspecting her?

611
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,690
I have that radio.

612
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:14,985
We need to see
if there are any other radios in here.

613
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,491
We all slept on the second floor.

614
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:24,286
But Bun-ok slept in her room alone.

615
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:26,747
You should search her room first.

616
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,208
Damn it. Stay out of it.
You don't know anything.

617
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,543
Hey.

618
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,129
If there's a mole among us,
it must be you. Who else would--

619
00:55:33,212 --> 00:55:35,256
Don't you know
Ms. Pi is on the ANSP's side?

620
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,299
Bun-ok. Shut it.

621
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:42,596
When I turned on the radio,
they said your name. I heard it clearly.

622
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:45,683
You're a spy for the ANSP. Am I wrong?

623
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,728
She's a spy for the ANSP?

624
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:52,481
-A spy for the ANSP?
-But really?

625
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:54,692
But that doesn't make sense.

626
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:58,529
Quiet.

627
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,322
Quiet!

628
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:03,325
Hold on.

629
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:06,704
Ms. Pi. Is what she said true?

630
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:10,332
You turned a blind eye
to Bun-ok's stealing.

631
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,001
So I wondered why.

632
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:13,836
Is this why?

633
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:17,965
Yes, what she said

634
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:20,926
is all true.

635
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:24,430
-It's true?
-What?

636
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:25,848
What?

637
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:27,308
So it's true?

638
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,728
-What, is she out of her mind?
-I can't trust anyone.

639
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:35,024
They even wiretapped the dorm
and had me keep an eye on you.

640
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,151
Wiretap?

641
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:38,777
God, that's scary.

642
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,738
-Is that true?
-Even wiretapped?

643
00:56:40,821 --> 00:56:44,116
But I swear I've never sold
any of you out to the ANSP.

644
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:49,038
If you were not going to do that,
why did you spy for them?

645
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:51,165
I'm sure…

646
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:56,587
she had to obey them
to protect all of the students.

647
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,839
I see.

648
00:56:58,923 --> 00:57:01,300
You searched all our rooms
with the spare keys.

649
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:03,093
Was that also to protect us?

650
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,054
Was it?

651
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,014
Jeong-min, shut it.

652
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:09,642
We must find the mole first.

653
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:13,312
I'll watch the students.
You should go search the rooms.

654
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:18,025
I'll leave them to you.

655
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:24,740
-I can't believe this.
-Can you believe her?

656
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:35,209
Bun-ok, stop right there!

657
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:38,963
One more step forward,

658
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:42,549
and that proves you're the mole.

659
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,849
How am I the mole?

660
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:53,852
You spied for the ANSP.
You must be the mole.

661
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:58,065
She is not!

662
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,281
If Ms. Pi ever wanted to harm us,

663
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,950
all the student protesters among us
would've been arrested.

664
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,745
Jeong-min and Hye-seong
would have already been arrested.

665
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,001
For now, it's best for all of us
not to leave this room

666
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:20,004
so that Mr. Lee can find the mole.

667
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:22,798
Bun-ok!

668
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:24,133
That damn b****.

669
00:58:24,216 --> 00:58:26,218
Hey, you two. Follow me!

670
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:30,639
You little…
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:33,559
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Come here.

672
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:35,477
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

673
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,521
-Take her inside!
-Come on.

674
00:58:37,604 --> 00:58:39,523
I'm really not the mole!

675
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:37,831
This money…

676
00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:39,833
You gave it to her, right?

677
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:42,336
You made Soo-ho believe you'd turned,

678
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:44,755
and use her

679
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:47,216
to inform Nam Tae-il of our plan.

680
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:52,930
Didn't you keep me tied
in the office all night?

681
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:57,393
I didn't even have a radio.
And even if I did,

682
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,772
what if she'd tell Tae-il
that I was a Northern spy?

683
01:00:02,314 --> 01:00:04,149
You think I'd risk that?

684
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:07,820
You have another radio, don't you?

685
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,656
Where did you hide it?

686
01:00:16,495 --> 01:00:17,871
It wasn't me.

687
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:20,749
I'm not the mole!

688
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:26,130
Why are you suspecting me and not
the ANSP informant? Am I an easy target?

689
01:00:26,296 --> 01:00:28,715
You looked down on me
on the group blind date too!

690
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,513
Apparently, I'm guilty
of the National Security Law violation,

691
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:37,891
threatening to kill, illegal possession
of firearms, and attempted murder.

692
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:41,395
I resent the fact
that my life's been ruined

693
01:00:41,478 --> 01:00:43,605
because of you,
so I beat my chest all night.

694
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:47,734
My chest is all bruised.
Do you want to see it?

695
01:00:49,987 --> 01:00:52,531
Why the hell did you come back?

696
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,327
You left the dorm safely
on the day of the Open House.

697
01:00:57,411 --> 01:00:58,829
Why did you have to come back?

698
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,172
Because of Yeong-ro?

699
01:01:12,259 --> 01:01:14,136
You came back to see Yeong-ro.

700
01:01:17,055 --> 01:01:20,642
Why do I have to
be sacrificed for your love?

701
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:23,854
Why? This is so unfair!

702
01:01:38,535 --> 01:01:39,828
HOSU WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY DORMITORY
OPEN HOUSE

703
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:44,374
December 3.

704
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:46,668
The day of the Open House.

705
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:49,505
Did you really leave the dorm?

706
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:53,300
Yes. Why?

707
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:58,138
"Dormitory has been searched.
A high risk of exposure.

708
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:00,265
Hoping to go to the North
as soon as possible."

709
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,858
The ANSP wiretapping team
intercepted this message.

710
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:12,945
On December 5.

711
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:15,697
What?

712
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:18,450
I naturally thought
you sent it from the dorm.

713
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,786
That's why I came here to catch you.

714
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,418
Then even before this hostage situation--

715
01:02:28,502 --> 01:02:29,962
There was a spy in here.

716
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:37,928
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

717
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:39,638
REPORT MESSAGE
SENDER: TAEDONG RIVER 1

718
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:41,223
Lim Soo-ho betrayed alone.

719
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:45,686
Guarantee Su-hui's safety.
If she is harmed,

720
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:48,605
I cannot guarantee Moran Hill 1's safety.

721
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:53,527
Is this bastard

722
01:02:54,111 --> 01:02:57,155
threatening me right now?

723
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:01,034
He must be worried you might kill Su-hui
because he's betrayed the party.

724
01:03:01,118 --> 01:03:04,413
He wants Su-hui to be the broadcaster
of the numbers station starting today.

725
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,873
Su-hui?

726
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,419
For fear we'll kill her
after recording her voice,

727
01:03:10,502 --> 01:03:13,297
he says he'll send us an
additional four-digit number

728
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,924
three hours before every broadcast.

729
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:21,346
He's trying so hard.

730
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:27,894
I'm not worried about Moran Hill 1.
I'm sure Nam Tae-il will save her.

731
01:03:28,562 --> 01:03:31,982
Then I'll leave the numbers station
to the usual broadcaster.

732
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:33,317
We should.

733
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:37,863
I, Lim Ji-rok, shouldn't let
a puppy like him push me around.

734
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:41,867
Send word to Haegeumseong 1 in the dorm

735
01:03:43,493 --> 01:03:45,203
that if the ANSP fails,

736
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:48,874
they're to kill the traitors
and return to Pyongyang.

737
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,293
Who on earth is it?

738
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,795
How can there be a mole?

739
01:03:53,879 --> 01:03:55,756
How long do we have to stay here?

740
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,424
Be quiet, will you?

741
01:03:57,507 --> 01:03:59,343
I said one sentence.

742
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:01,303
What if it's among us?

743
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:02,512
Among us?

744
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,824
RÉSUMÉ
OH DEOK-SIM

745
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:25,577
GRADUATED FROM NORTH HAMGYONG PROVINCE
MYEONGCHEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

746
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:32,084
WORKED AT A SAUDI ARABIAN
CONSTRUCTION SITE

747
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:34,461
RÉSUMÉ
KIM MAN-DONG

748
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:00,445
Anything unusual?

749
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,863
Before coming to work here,

750
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:04,241
he was a construction worker
in the Middle East.

751
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:05,992
What about Ms. Oh's résumé?

752
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,620
She came to the South
during the Korean War.

753
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,123
I think she commutes
to the dorm every day.

754
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,083
Did you search the cafeteria?

755
01:05:16,962 --> 01:05:18,630
Someone stole chickens.

756
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:22,467
Last night, someone stole chickens.

757
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:07,053
Soo-ho.

758
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,460
Hello?

759
01:06:46,384 --> 01:06:47,636
Gang-mu?

760
01:06:51,056 --> 01:06:52,891
This is Director Eun.

761
01:06:57,354 --> 01:06:59,856
He must've taken it from her.

762
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:06,863
Come to your senses, Gang-mu.

763
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:09,282
What do you gain by turning against us?

764
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:10,992
You're digging your own grave.

765
01:07:27,884 --> 01:07:29,511
Let me ask you something.

766
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:33,723
These innocent students…

767
01:07:35,183 --> 01:07:37,352
Are you really planning to kill them all?

768
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:39,396
Why would we kill the innocent students?

769
01:07:39,479 --> 01:07:40,856
You heard the recording.

770
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:42,607
We agreed to save the hostages.

771
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,569
Do you expect me to believe that
when you've set up bombs?

772
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:47,737
They're just for threatening.

773
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,781
Don't you trust the ANSP?

774
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:53,118
My father was

775
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,204
shot to death while chasing a spy.

776
01:07:58,331 --> 01:08:02,252
I followed suit and joined the ANSP
to catch all those communists.

777
01:08:02,961 --> 01:08:04,588
But rather than catching communists,

778
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:09,968
the agency framed innocent people
for espionage to produce results.

779
01:08:12,178 --> 01:08:13,388
So I ran away.

780
01:08:14,764 --> 01:08:18,435
"Fine. All I have to do
is catch real communists."

781
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:21,187
Telling myself that,

782
01:08:22,397 --> 01:08:23,940
I wandered around.

783
01:08:25,442 --> 01:08:27,360
What do you think I should do now?

784
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,323
The ANSP is trying
to kill the innocent students.

785
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:38,121
Where should I run to this time?

786
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:48,173
You ran away pretending to have no idea.

787
01:08:49,174 --> 01:08:52,886
Do that this time too.
Just as you've been doing.

788
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:14,741
I don't think we can locate Yeong-ro.

789
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:24,876
Proceed as planned.

790
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:26,544
Yes, sir.

791
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,555
Where do you belong?

792
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:42,894
I have no idea.

793
01:09:44,604 --> 01:09:48,400
I dont know. Why are you doing this to me?

794
01:09:48,483 --> 01:09:49,901
I'm not it!

795
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:50,819
Lady.

796
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:53,321
Stop pretending to be insane!

797
01:09:54,447 --> 01:09:55,323
Stop it!

798
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:57,659
Look.

799
01:09:57,742 --> 01:10:00,078
Why would she be pretending to be insane?

800
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,790
And she's normally really cold and edgy.

801
01:10:04,499 --> 01:10:07,419
She started behaving that way after
the hostage-taking. Isn't it suspicious?

802
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:10,839
Well, she was always quite moody,

803
01:10:10,922 --> 01:10:15,093
and after the gunfire and everything,
she must've been so shocked.

804
01:10:16,052 --> 01:10:19,514
Look. It's been so long
since the war ended.

805
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:21,141
Have you ever been in a war?

806
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:27,772
She's from the North.

807
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:30,775
While fleeing to the South,

808
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,903
she lost her father, mother,
and brother from bombings.

809
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:36,531
Their bodies were ripped
to pieces in front of her.

810
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,535
That's why even the sound of airplanes
still frightens her into a fit.

811
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:46,249
Hey, it's all right.
You can come out here.

812
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,711
-Come out now.
-I don't know…

813
01:10:58,845 --> 01:11:00,388
I'm sorry…

814
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:04,476
-Hey, don't cry.
-I'm sorry…

815
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:06,936
I'm sorry…

816
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:10,815
I'm sorry…

817
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,905
I'm sorry…

818
01:11:18,865 --> 01:11:20,909
Ms. Oh is the mole?

819
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:22,744
She was a Northern spy.

820
01:11:22,827 --> 01:11:23,828
It's so scary.

821
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:27,749
Then we've been eating
what a Northern spy cooked?

822
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,793
Anyway,

823
01:11:30,877 --> 01:11:34,089
the mole's been caught,
so you're free to go back to your rooms.

824
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:38,551
But refrain from leaving your rooms
except when you go to the restroom.

825
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:48,603
It's so scary.

826
01:12:20,343 --> 01:12:21,678
It looks like PTSD.

827
01:12:22,262 --> 01:12:23,721
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

828
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,392
A weak-minded person like her was a spy?

829
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:29,894
Do you believe it?

830
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,817
We weren't able to become spies
because we were strong from the beginning.

831
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:40,446
It's because we were trained so.

832
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:52,292
It's almost time to cook dinner…

833
01:12:54,794 --> 01:12:58,631
This is the end of a secret agent
who dedicated her life to her country?

834
01:13:54,979 --> 01:13:57,982
What's your plan?
Are you going to go to war with the ANSP?

835
01:13:59,275 --> 01:14:01,444
Bombs have been installed around the dorm.

836
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,822
The SWAT team might break in
to rescue you tonight.

837
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:12,455
I will

838
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:15,667
go meet my father.

839
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,672
Let me convince him in person.

840
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:25,260
If he changes his mind,
we'll all be able to live.

841
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:30,098
No. If you meet him,

842
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:33,559
your father will try to get you out.

843
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:37,272
Once his daughter is out,
they'll blow up the dorm.

844
01:14:39,232 --> 01:14:42,235
But you said
the SWAT team might break in tonight.

845
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:46,281
You're just two. Will you be okay?

846
01:14:47,657 --> 01:14:50,702
Before you decide to fight,
we should try everything you can.

847
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:52,912
Let me do this.

848
01:14:53,788 --> 01:14:54,872
Please?

849
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:23,651
If you found out
where Yeong-ro and Dr. Kang are,

850
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:26,154
it would've made this a lot easier.

851
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:29,198
You boasted about your informant,
but what is this?

852
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:31,784
Gang-mu took her radio from her.
Why is that--

853
01:15:31,868 --> 01:15:33,036
Quiet!

854
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,748
Ready to go in.

855
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:46,215
Hello?

856
01:15:46,299 --> 01:15:48,634
Yeong-ro wants to meet you.

857
01:15:49,052 --> 01:15:51,846
Come to the shrine in five minutes. Alone.

858
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,098
If you try anything stupid,
she'll be hurt.

859
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:57,185
You must come alone.

860
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:10,531
If anything goes wrong, you might die.

861
01:16:11,324 --> 01:16:13,993
All that's left for us now is all-out war.

862
01:16:14,952 --> 01:16:16,204
We have no choice.

863
01:16:18,498 --> 01:16:22,293
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try it.

864
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:45,191
I should bring the minimum number
of agents, or they'll catch on.

865
01:16:45,691 --> 01:16:48,736
I only brought two marksmen, sir.

866
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,864
But this could be a trap.
It's dangerous to go in alone.

867
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:53,616
Why don't you wear this bulletproof vest?

868
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:05,586
I'll go in first.

869
01:17:06,045 --> 01:17:07,797
I'll shout "Yeong-ro" as a signal.

870
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,299
Then come in through the shrine.

871
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,718
We must kill him.

872
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:15,304
Understood, sir.

873
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:21,602
Kill the target only. Mr. Eun and
his daughter's safety is our top priority.

874
01:17:21,686 --> 01:17:22,854
Over and out.

875
01:18:21,537 --> 01:18:22,914
Will you be all right?

876
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,648
Yeong-ro.

877
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:08,834
Are you all right?

878
01:19:11,963 --> 01:19:13,422
Are you hurt at all?

879
01:19:19,136 --> 01:19:20,346
Put the gun down.

880
01:19:26,185 --> 01:19:29,021
Have you ever seen
the ANSP director carrying a gun?

881
01:19:37,697 --> 01:19:38,698
Dad.

882
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:40,366
Yes?

883
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:47,498
Is it true
that you're going to kill us all?

884
01:19:48,124 --> 01:19:51,877
Of course not.
Who told you that? That's absurd.

885
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:54,171
Please stop it.

886
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:58,467
I know all you're thinking about
is winning the election.

887
01:19:58,551 --> 01:19:59,760
What are you talking about?

888
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,513
I really want to save you.

889
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,433
Not just me. You must save my friends too!
The students!

890
01:20:05,516 --> 01:20:07,643
There are more than 30 students
in the dorm!

891
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:19,405
And they're innocent. You know that.

892
01:20:21,532 --> 01:20:23,117
Please save us.

893
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:27,163
It's all my fault.

894
01:20:28,706 --> 01:20:30,374
Why do you think that way?

895
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,792
Don't move.

896
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,214
And my brother…

897
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:40,217
Yeong-u…

898
01:20:42,136 --> 01:20:44,847
died because of me.

899
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,107
If my friends die too,

900
01:20:57,318 --> 01:20:58,819
I won't be able to…

901
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:00,988
Yeong-ro.

902
01:21:01,989 --> 01:21:03,074
Please…

903
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:07,078
I don't have the power
to decide everything on my own.

904
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:11,248
But I'll do my best
to persuade them not to hurt anyone.

905
01:21:11,332 --> 01:21:12,583
Don't move!

906
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:20,716
Can you trust me?

907
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,558
Yeong-ro.

908
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:38,609
Yeong-ro!

909
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:48,994
No!

910
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:16,689
Don't shoot! Yeong-ro!

911
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:20,276
Come in!

912
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:21,694
-Yeong-ro!
-Come in!

913
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:23,195
Move back!

914
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,572
Don't shoot!

915
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:28,659
Don't shoot! Hold fire!

916
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:32,329
I'm the ANSP director! Hold fire--

917
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:52,099
Director Eun Chang-su of the ANSP
was shot by the armed spies

918
01:22:52,183 --> 01:22:54,435
near the Hosu University dorm.

919
01:22:54,518 --> 01:22:56,395
-How's Eun?
-The wound is severe,

920
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,355
so they'll know for sure
after the surgery.

921
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:00,858
So? Is he going to make it or not?

922
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,735
Eun is still not conscious.

923
01:23:02,818 --> 01:23:05,154
Since he's out,
it's a perfect opportunity for Nam.

924
01:23:05,237 --> 01:23:07,865
He only cares about saving his daughter.

925
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:09,742
We can't leave our fate to him.

926
01:23:09,825 --> 01:23:11,786
In ten minutes, we will

927
01:23:11,869 --> 01:23:12,912
retake the dorm.

928
01:23:12,995 --> 01:23:14,747
Taking a hard line? Does that mean…

929
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:20,377
They're making up a reason to kill us off
including the hostages.

930
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,254
How are the two of them
going to protect us?

931
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:23,589
What do we do now?

932
01:23:23,672 --> 01:23:26,634
They'll frame us for killing the hostages.

933
01:23:27,218 --> 01:23:29,637
We should get ready to fight now.

934
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:31,806
What if they really

935
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:36,101
break in to kill us all?
What do we do then?

936
01:23:38,896 --> 01:23:41,690
BONUS

937
01:23:41,774 --> 01:23:44,777
CHIEF OF THE OPC
AN GYEONG-HUI

938
01:23:47,613 --> 01:23:52,284
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR HONORABLE PROMOTION
