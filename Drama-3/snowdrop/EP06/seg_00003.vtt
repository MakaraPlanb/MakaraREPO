00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.339 line:85.83%,end
Counterattack?

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:28.302 line:85.83%,end
Making up evidence with a dead guy is
just a piece of cake. What counterattack?

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.890 line:85.83%,end
Will the higher-ups be content with
inspiring a sense of national security?

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:40.439 line:85.83%,end
Do it.

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:43.442 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell them right now
he was trying to defect to the North.

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:46.236 line:85.83%,end
<i>Of course, he'd kill them.</i>

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.405 line:85.83%,end
<i>You know how people are willing</i>

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.199 line:85.83%,end
to kill their own family,

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.452 line:85.83%,end
cousins, and even children
if it helps them become king.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.287 line:85.83%,end
So why would he be any different?

00:15:55.871 --> 00:16:00.334 line:85.83%,end
Come on. You know how much
Ms. Hong care for his daughter.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.587 line:85.83%,end
Your own child means

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:05.798 line:85.83%,end
more than anything in the world.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:11.845 line:85.83%,end
I feel like a horrible person.

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.390 line:85.83%,end
As soon as I heard
about the hostage situation,

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.725 line:85.83%,end
the first thing I thought of
is the fortuneteller.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.938 line:85.83%,end
She's not even your own daughter.

00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:24.108 line:85.83%,end
I must say,
you're such an angel, Ms. Hong.

00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:27.736 line:85.83%,end
Are you

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.323 line:85.83%,end
very worried that 13 people will die

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.409 line:85.83%,end
in the dorm?

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:36.286 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.249 line:85.83%,end
That must be why
you ran over here so late at night.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.251 line:85.83%,end
I ran over here

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.336 line:85.83%,end
so late at night?

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:49.133 line:85.83%,end
They say you can never hide
your humble origins.

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:50.718 line:85.83%,end
How could you be so rude?

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:54.555 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know my husband is
your husband's superior?

00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:55.973 line:85.83%,end
Charlotte.

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.768 line:85.83%,end
You know that my husband graduated
from the military academy

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.228 line:85.83%,end
four years earlier than him?

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:03.355 line:85.83%,end
Pardon?

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:07.609 line:85.83%,end
Well, yes. That's…

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.405 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.534 line:85.83%,end
They say the boughs that bear the most
hang the lowest.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.829 line:85.83%,end
I know the higher-up likes your husband,

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:21.373 line:85.83%,end
but he might end up paying dearly

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.377 line:85.83%,end
for disrespecting his senior.
I'm quite worried.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.422 line:85.83%,end
Worried?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.799 line:85.83%,end
You're worried?

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:32.801 line:85.83%,end
You wench!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.804 line:85.83%,end
How dare a lowly entertainer like you
threaten me?

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.640 line:85.83%,end
I'm a daughter of a general.
A four-star general!

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.438 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. Ma'am, please calm down.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:49.151 line:85.83%,end
Hey, your husband rose
from humble origins.

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:53.405 line:85.83%,end
Mine has many high-ranking in-laws.
You think they're on the same level?

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:57.451 line:85.83%,end
Your husband becoming president.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.703 line:85.83%,end
Don't even dream about it.

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:03.123 line:85.83%,end
It's not something
a lowlife like you can covet!

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.176 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Hong, I'll get going too.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.572 line:85.83%,end
<i>He definitely ordered us
to cooperate with the South.</i>

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:41.954 line:85.83%,end
<i>Father must've made a deal with
the director of ANSP to save our lives.</i>

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.006 line:85.83%,end
<i>Then why did they…</i>

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.760 line:85.83%,end
<i>try to kill us?</i>

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:25.372 line:85.83%,end
I laid Comrade Lee down
in the next room. He's severely injured.

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:27.040 line:85.83%,end
I'll go to him with the first aid kit.

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.172 line:85.83%,end
You.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:40.804 line:85.83%,end
Follow me with the first aid kit.

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.776 line:85.83%,end
-Why is he taking her?
-I don't know.

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:56.904 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:05.704 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.458 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.094 line:85.83%,end
Wait.
