EPISODE 6

3
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,868
Now…

4
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,746
Plan B is the only option now.

5
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,248
And in order for it to succeed,

6
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,335
we must kill them all.

7
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,049
As soon as they come out,

8
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,676
-kill them all.
-Mr. Nam,

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,680
even if we go with plan B, if we kill
them, the North won't sit back--

10
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,598
What if they won't?

11
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,975
We made a deal--

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,153
You think they'll disclose
that we made a deal?

13
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,656
We have no choice but
to exaggerate the engagement.

14
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,659
If the North throws a monkey wrench
into the works, it'll fail!

15
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,286
You think they're that stupid?

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,289
You think they'll refuse the chance
to make huge money every election?

17
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,584
But if it fails,
the hostages' lives will be in danger!

18
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,669
God damn it!

19
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,297
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

20
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
Everyone, retreat.

21
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,652
This is HQ. Ambush team,
we're going in for the kill.

22
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,654
Once the targets are in the zone,

23
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,197
kill them at all costs.

24
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,534
The targets appeared. All units,
they're approaching the kill zone.

25
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,702
Stand by.

26
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,961
Let's go.

27
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,383
Stop.

28
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,735
Three targets, armed with AK-47s.

29
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,977
A change of plan. Open fire.

30
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,858
Eung-cheol!

31
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,252
Everyone, calm down.

32
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,714
I think they're trying to escape
through the exit in basement two.

33
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,341
And I'll go after them right now.

34
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,302
So everyone stay here.

35
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,347
Let's go.

36
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,203
Eung-cheol, hold me.

37
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,679
You bastards!

38
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,432
It's a grenade! Get down!

39
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,438
All units, fire!

40
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,782
Get out of here! Hurry up!

41
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,046
Four of our guys are injured.

42
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,298
It looks like the plan failed.

43
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,262
I'll kill them all.

44
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,283
Eung-cheol!

45
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,618
Get it together.

46
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,404
<i>We're going in.
We'll go in and secure the targets.</i>

47
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,822
Hey, halt! Halt!

48
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,866
This is the director of ANSP. Halt!

49
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,543
If the students are killed,
we'll be doomed!

50
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,714
Why do you think
this happened in the first place?

51
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,175
Exaggerating the engagement won't help us!

52
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,052
Let's just go in and eliminate them all!

53
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,889
Are you insane?
What if all the hostages are killed?

54
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,349
I'll deal with the communist jerks,

55
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,768
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

56
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,062
SWAT team, listen--

57
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,149
If you stab them in the back twice,
how will you negotiate with them?

58
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,902
You think you can bury this
without anyone knowing?

59
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,807
You made sure
no one will talk about this, right?

60
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,477
If anyone asks about this
hostage situation, just lock them all up!

61
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,728
We already

62
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,065
took necessary measures just in case.

63
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,109
We told the shop owners

64
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,696
that we were catching deserters.
And we made sure

65
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
to keep the press quiet about it.

66
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,491
But your daughter…

67
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,001
Do you think the other hostages are okay?

68
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,795
Put me through to the dorm.

69
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,986
You bastard.

70
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,678
You son of a b****!

71
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,192
You murderer.

72
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,945
You bastard!

73
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,534
How dare you kill my husband?

74
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:12,380
Who gave you the right to kill him?

75
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,346
You murderer!

76
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,140
How dare you!

77
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,353
Bring her here.

78
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,898
You're all right. Calm down.

79
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,862
Twice.

80
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,448
They deceived us twice!

81
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,368
You wasted our precious bullets.

82
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,038
It's always an emotional prick
like you that ruins a mission.

83
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,460
You need to be coolheaded
in a situation like this.

84
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,255
If you keep this up,
I won't need you anymore.

85
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,264
Everyone go back to the cafeteria.

86
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,894
Now!

87
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,409
I'll watch the cafeteria.
You go bring Eung-cheol.

88
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,537
And lock him in another room.

89
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,166
You two.

90
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,960
Follow me.

91
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,674
Yes, sir!

92
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,609
Yes.

93
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,320
Sir.

94
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,822
It's the military situation room.

95
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,042
Hey, have you looked into the casualties?

96
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,294
Ask about Han I-seop first.

97
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,631
Yes, sir!
All of the armed spies were killed.

98
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:05,636
And Professor Han who was with them
was killed by one of the Northern spies.

99
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,679
Is he dead?

100
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,266
How about our casualties?

101
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,769
One killed in action
and four injured, sir.

102
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,814
Yeong-u!

103
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,233
Yeong-u, stay with me!

104
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,279
You'll be okay. Hang in there.

105
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,001
Don't tell their families just yet.

106
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,628
And ask the press for a news embargo.

107
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,134
Here. We need help here.

108
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,430
Chief An.

109
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,308
Tell the press that Han I-seop died
while defecting to the North.

110
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,727
-Defecting to the North?
-Yes.

111
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,313
<i>But he was the
opposition party's mentor in economics.</i>

112
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,480
An.

113
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,442
Just tell them the North abducted him
and we tried to rescue him.

114
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,403
Inspiring the people's sense
of national security will help us--

115
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,282
You want to stop there
when we can win the game?

116
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,744
If the opposition party raises an issue,
we will be counterattacked.

117
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,339
Counterattack?

118
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,302
Making up evidence with a dead guy is
just a piece of cake. What counterattack?

119
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,890
Will the higher-ups be content with
inspiring a sense of national security?

120
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
Do it.

121
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,442
I'll tell them right now
he was trying to defect to the North.

122
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,236
<i>Of course, he'd kill them.</i>

123
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,405
<i>You know how people are willing</i>

124
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,199
to kill their own family,

125
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,452
cousins, and even children
if it helps them become king.

126
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,287
So why would he be any different?

127
00:15:55,871 --> 00:16:00,334
Come on. You know how much
Ms. Hong care for his daughter.

128
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,587
Your own child means

129
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,798
more than anything in the world.

130
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,845
I feel like a horrible person.

131
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,390
As soon as I heard
about the hostage situation,

132
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,725
the first thing I thought of
is the fortuneteller.

133
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,938
She's not even your own daughter.

134
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,108
I must say,
you're such an angel, Ms. Hong.

135
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,736
Are you

136
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,323
very worried that 13 people will die

137
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,409
in the dorm?

138
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,286
What?

139
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,249
That must be why
you ran over here so late at night.

140
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,251
I ran over here

141
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,336
so late at night?

142
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,133
They say you can never hide
your humble origins.

143
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,718
How could you be so rude?

144
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,555
Don't you know my husband is
your husband's superior?

145
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,973
Charlotte.

146
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,768
You know that my husband graduated
from the military academy

147
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,228
four years earlier than him?

148
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,355
Pardon?

149
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,609
Well, yes. That's…

150
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,405
Yes, I'm aware of that.

151
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,534
They say the boughs that bear the most
hang the lowest.

152
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,829
I know the higher-up likes your husband,

153
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,373
but he might end up paying dearly

154
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,377
for disrespecting his senior.
I'm quite worried.

155
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,422
Worried?

156
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
You're worried?

157
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,801
You wench!

158
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,804
How dare a lowly entertainer like you
threaten me?

159
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm a daughter of a general.
A four-star general!

160
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,438
My goodness. Ma'am, please calm down.

161
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:49,151
Hey, your husband rose
from humble origins.

162
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,405
Mine has many high-ranking in-laws.
You think they're on the same level?

163
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,451
Your husband becoming president.

164
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,703
Don't even dream about it.

165
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,123
It's not something
a lowlife like you can covet!

166
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,176
Ms. Hong, I'll get going too.

167
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,572
<i>He definitely ordered us
to cooperate with the South.</i>

168
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,954
<i>Father must've made a deal with
the director of ANSP to save our lives.</i>

169
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,006
<i>Then why did they…</i>

170
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,760
<i>try to kill us?</i>

171
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,372
I laid Comrade Lee down
in the next room. He's severely injured.

172
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,040
I'll go to him with the first aid kit.

173
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,172
You.

174
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,804
Follow me with the first aid kit.

175
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,776
-Why is he taking her?
-I don't know.

176
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,904
Keep your heads down.

177
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,704
Eung-cheol.

178
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,094
Wait.

180
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,187
I said, wait.

181
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,658
I'm okay, sir.

182
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,660
No, you're not, you punk.

183
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,853
Fortunately,
you didn't hurt any arteries or veins.

184
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,232
I could even take
an axe blade with my abs.

185
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,901
So this wound is nothing.

186
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,903
I can survive this.

187
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,165
It should be treated.

188
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,315
Let everyone go.

189
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,869
If you feel bad for me just a little bit,

190
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,873
let them go. Please.

191
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,131
Let them go.

192
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:19,022
Tomorrow morning, I'll demand a doctor
who will treat Eung-cheol's wound.

193
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,442
They'll demand the release of a hostage.

194
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,070
And I'm…

195
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,533
planning to release you.

196
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,664
To repay you for what you've done
for me these past few days.

197
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,584
We'll be even then.

198
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,007
"Even"?

199
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,352
Go back to the cafeteria.

200
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,214
Look at her.

201
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,425
Her hand is bandaged.

202
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,470
-What? Bandage?
-She's right.

203
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,888
He treated her?

204
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,098
But why treat only her?

205
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,483
Lim Soo-ho?

206
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,110
Are you guys okay?

207
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,738
I'll speak to the person in charge.

208
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,492
There are people who don't agree with me,
so it went awry.

209
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,078
<i>But I'm still willing to get you out</i>

210
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,704
safely and--

211
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,832
I'll talk to the person
who ordered to kill us.

212
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,544
I'm the person in charge here.
I'm the director of ANSP.

213
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,551
So you're the one
who ordered to kill us, you bastard?

214
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,302
What? "Bastard"?

215
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,888
How dare this communist call you that?

216
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,183
Give it. I'll teach him a lesson. Give it!

217
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,102
Stop it, you idiot!

218
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,942
Don't deal with him. Why don't you
go home? I'll take care of this.

219
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,652
You'll take care of this?

220
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,903
Why don't you go home?

221
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,698
You're not coolheaded,
desperate to save your child.

222
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,615
You little…

223
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,786
Are you trying to get her killed?

224
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,081
If they find out,
what do you think they'll do?

225
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,172
What're you looking at?

226
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,724
There was an engagement on the West Sea
at around 22:00.

227
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,560
An engagement?

228
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,272
<i>The ship for the North was
stupid enough to be get caught.</i>

229
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:52,277
The navy found the ship,
so there was nothing I could do.

230
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,030
And my colleagues?

231
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,947
<i>Before that…</i>

232
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,075
I heard gunfire. Are the students okay?

233
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,124
If you wanted them safe,
you shouldn't have deceived us twice.

234
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,129
What happened to my colleagues?

235
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,465
Unfortunately,

236
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,093
everyone was killed
including Professor Han.

237
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,721
Everyone?

238
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,683
How can I believe you?

239
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,226
Whether or not you believe me,

240
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,521
I want to help you.

241
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,566
<i>Give me a bit more time,
and I'll come up with a plan--</i>

242
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,109
When you tried to kill us,

243
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,074
had the North approved it?

244
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,534
Of course not. We had no time for that.

245
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,246
Remember this.

246
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,877
Once we're convinced we're never
going back alive, we'll blow ourselves up.

247
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,005
And all the hostages will die too.

248
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,238
<i>You must accomplish
this mission at all costs, okay?</i>

249
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,534
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

250
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,786
<i>are pointing a gun at me.</i>

251
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,207
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

252
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,542
Don't forget that.

253
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,891
Mom…

254
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,155
PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR KIM IL SUNG,
DEAR LEADER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE

255
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,951
Because your son failed the mission,

256
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,287
we lost 300 million dollars.

257
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,205
The party's 300 million dollars.

258
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,792
Have you forgotten our Leader
ordered us to get it done at all costs?

259
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,587
It's too early

260
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,506
to say the mission has failed.

261
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,760
Too early?

262
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,138
You think your son,
who's holding people hostage

263
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,765
in the middle of Seoul,

264
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,143
will come back with 300 million dollars?

265
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,191
The party will make a decision soon.
Prepare yourself.

266
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,201
We failed our mission,
so there's only one option left for us.

267
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,080
To kill them all

268
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,625
and blow ourselves up.

269
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,923
It's too early for that. We must try
our best to go back alive until the end.

270
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,217
I'll buy as much time as--

271
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,095
We shouldn't beg them for negotiation.
Blowing ourselves up…

272
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,433
is the only way
to defend the honor of our Leader.

273
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,108
We'll be dying for nothing.

274
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,902
Dying for nothing?

275
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,999
You son of a b****.

276
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,668
You dare to call it dying for nothing?

277
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,548
To shoot all the hostages dead

278
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,300
and blow ourselves up in a determined way

279
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,886
is the most honorable death for us!

280
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,433
I'll decide if we must die or not.

281
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,727
I'm your leader.

282
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,439
You're just a soft guy
from a powerful family. How dare you

283
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,024
disrespect the revolutionary spirit?

284
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,028
It would've gone smoothly
if you hadn't come to the dorm!

285
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,622
Hey, Yeong-ro. Do something.

286
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,000
You and he must be close.

287
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,710
Do something for us!

288
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,462
What could she do?

289
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,673
we were also fooled.
She didn't know he was a spy either.

290
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,799
She didn't?

291
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,135
Look what she got us into.
"I didn't know" won't cut it.

292
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,971
You guys from room 207
are accomplices. So be quiet.

293
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,683
Accomplices?
Look, I'm also mad at Yeong-ro.

294
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,186
I told you we shouldn't have hid him!

295
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:30,234
But it is true that we really thought
he was a college student we met on a date.

296
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,528
And you met him with us.

297
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,407
She's right.
And he was your partner that day.

298
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,825
-Partner?
-Bun-ok's partner?

299
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,077
She joined them?

300
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,788
So you think you did nothing wrong?

301
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,414
Stop arguing!

302
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,291
The ANSP agent was just dragged out.

303
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,044
We must find a way to get out alive.

304
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,420
Why take it out on me?

305
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,215
You think we can find any way
in this situation?

306
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,885
Byeong-tae!

307
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,428
Do something.

308
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,765
You'll be commissioned soon.
Will you just sit back?

309
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,810
Isn't there any manual
for a situation like this?

310
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:05,895
Actually…

311
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,192
There's nothing in particular.

312
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
But…

313
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,410
With my great leadership

314
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,413
and sense of duty to save your lives,
let me tell you something.

315
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,417
In 1972, there was a hostage situation
during the Munich Olympics.

316
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,296
And the West German police
dealt with it in such an idiotic way,

317
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,506
so all the hostages

318
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,299
were killed.

319
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,386
-Oh, no.
-All of them?

320
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,056
You didn't know?
It's a well-known tragedy.

321
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,602
Anyway, even the West German
police failed like that.

322
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,896
So the Korean police and ANSP…

323
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,900
We should never count on them.

324
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,282
For now,

325
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,742
those bastards…

326
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,494
We should

327
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,373
do as those bastards say
if we want to stay alive.

328
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,542
God, you idiot!

329
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,170
-You stupid…
-What?

330
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,504
You idiot.

331
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,673
You little…

332
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,635
Keep quiet!

333
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,182
How will you handle
the consequences of the failed mission?

334
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,519
I'm the leader.
I'll take full responsibility.

335
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,813
You did nothing wrong.

336
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,399
I'll go back alive at all cost
and take responsibility.

337
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,525
Responsibility?

338
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:39,822
You're a coward begging for your life
even after being fooled twice.

339
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,325
How will you do that?

340
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,502
Comrade Joo.

341
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,134
Don't forget the party
ordered you to obey my orders.

342
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,817
You think the party trusts you,
but you're mistaken.

343
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,864
If I sense any change
in your ideology, I can--

344
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:05,366
Why did you disobey my orders
and follow me into Mount Ogong?

345
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,455
If you disobey my orders again,

346
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,749
then…

347
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,254
I won't shoot here.

348
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,175
I'll shoot here.

349
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,054
Your life depends on me, your leader.

350
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,474
Don't forget that.

351
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,239
Comrade Lim…

352
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,998
The rifle!

353
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,065
Ms. Oh?

354
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,823
Oh, no.

355
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,679
Bang!

356
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,934
Bang!

357
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,145
Bang!

358
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,605
Bang!

359
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:06,070
Bang!

360
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,573
My goodness. My arm hurts so much.

361
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,826
-Gosh.
-She's not herself right now.

362
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,786
The rifle is so heavy.

363
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,622
Stop it and come here.

364
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,794
Yes. All right. Just sit down.

365
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,711
Sit now.

366
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,557
Lim Soo-ho?

367
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,767
We have an injured person.

368
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,478
-Send a doctor in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

369
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,398
But how about you release
some of them in return?

370
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,276
You have too many hostages
for the three of you anyway.

371
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,988
Send in a doctor in ten minutes.

372
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,739
We need more time.

373
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,618
We'll find a doctor as soon as possible,
so release some of them first.

374
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,078
You have 20 minutes.

375
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,082
<i>If a doctor doesn't come in here by 9:44,</i>

376
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,336
I'll execute
one hostage every ten minutes.

377
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,094
Hey, find a doctor right away.
We only got 20 minutes.

378
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,429
20 minutes?

379
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,098
Even our agency doctor
can't get here in 20 minutes.

380
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,266
What?

381
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,769
I see.

382
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:26,525
Those damn bastards, are they trying
to train us like some freaking dog?

383
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,113
Why are you dilly-dallying when you can
just break in and wipe them out?

384
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,492
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

385
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,536
Kang Cheong-ya speaking.

386
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,704
Hey, where are you?

387
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,456
<i>What do you mean?</i>

388
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,957
You called me at the hospital.

389
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,251
That's good. Come
to the Hosu University dorm right now.

390
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,420
Yes. It'll take
less than ten minutes, right?

391
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,963
<i>Why do you want me there?</i>

392
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,426
The spies' hostage situation?

393
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,555
<i>Come over here right now! To the scene!</i>

394
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,370
We'll escort you.

395
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,833
Open it!

396
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,962
-Hurry up!
-Open it!

397
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,427
<i>I'll disguise</i>

398
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,346
Han-na as a nurse, send her in,

399
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,891
and rescue your daughter first
no matter what.

400
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:45,062
But if we act rashly,
it'll put the hostages in more danger.

401
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,814
This is the perfect chance.

402
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,401
If this drags on and they find out
she's your daughter, then it will…

403
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,821
I'm sorry to say this,

404
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,699
but something tragic might happen.

405
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,498
But Han-na wasn't very prudent yesterday.

406
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,542
Is she reliable?

407
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,421
Disguise myself as a nurse?

408
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,089
But they must know my face.

409
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,716
None of them knows your face.

410
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,593
They saw you briefly during the shoot-out.

411
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,139
I even spoke with them.

412
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,516
Do you remember
when I lost Han while tailing him?

413
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,184
I'm sure they set us up.

414
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,562
They must know my face.

415
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,440
In any case, go in with the doctor

416
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,610
and rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

417
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,071
And how will I do that?

418
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,742
It might put the rest in more danger.
Don't you know that?

419
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,786
How am I supposed to pull off
the special op without equipment?

420
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,373
You're known for this kind of thing.

421
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,876
You don't need any equipment.
Use your brain.

422
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,214
<i>Sweetie,</i>

423
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,925
you know how much I love you, right?

424
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,638
Cut to the chase. I came because
you said it was urgent. What is it?

425
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,350
Don't tell me
I have to treat those Northern spies.

426
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,275
There are three spies in there,
and two of them are injured.

427
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,777
Spies?

428
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,819
Forget it.

429
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,862
Wait.

430
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,073
If I take care of this well,

431
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,116
my party will support me in the future.

432
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,869
And it'll help me become president.

433
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,996
You said you wanted to see me become one.

434
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,582
If you, my beloved sweetie,

435
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:33,087
kill two of them with injections
pretending treating their wounds,

436
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,255
-then only one will be left.
-"Kill"?

437
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,885
Are you seriously
telling me to commit murder?

438
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,639
It's not murder. It's execution.

439
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,017
There are 60 innocent college girls
being held in there.

440
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,228
By executing those spies,

441
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,731
you'll be saving the 60 innocent people.

442
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,072
You thought I'd be moved by such nonsense?

443
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:06,537
If I become president of this country,

444
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,206
I'll be able to abandon
my four-star father-in-law

445
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,500
and leave my dumb wife.

446
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,753
I doubt that.

447
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,173
My life wish is

448
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,761
to keep you by my side 24/7

449
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,096
for the rest of my life.

450
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,348
You know that.

451
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,854
Let's say I've taken care of the two.

452
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,356
What if the last one tries to kill me?

453
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:40,362
Do you really think I'd put you in danger
without any contingency plan?

454
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,656
Contingency plan?

455
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,785
<i>Soon, the whole building</i>

456
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,037
<i>will be wiretapped.</i>

457
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,790
<i>Once you take care of the two,</i>

458
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,543
<i>just say, "I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."</i>

459
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,130
<i>Once we hear you say that,
our forces will break in secretly</i>

460
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,299
<i>and kill the last one.</i>

461
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,929
But they're just three spies.

462
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,766
Do you have to pull this kind of trick?

463
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:14,104
What I want is simple.
I just want to break in and kill them all.

464
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,273
But…

465
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,320
it turned out Eun's daughter
is one of the hostages.

466
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,866
Mr. Eun's daughter?

467
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,163
I can't just do as I want
beside the anxious father.

468
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,749
So it came to this.

469
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,048
Even if you're asking, I'm a doctor.
I can't kill a person. No, I won't.

470
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,176
Please. Do this for me, honey.

471
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,552
-Please.
-Instead,

472
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,889
I'll add sleep-inducing element
to the painkiller

473
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,474
and make them unconscious.

474
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:57,022
You wicked little fox.

475
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,525
Repeat the code phrase.

476
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,947
"I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."

477
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,448
Good.

478
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,579
Area 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5

479
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,665
are ready to be wiretapped.

480
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,169
Eun!

481
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,963
-Sir.
-Hurry up.

482
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,050
It's nice to meet you.

483
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,635
You too.

484
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,554
Director Eun and Chief An.

485
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,809
As far as we know, two of the spies
and one agent of ours are injured.

486
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,646
Judging by the gunfire, some of
the students might've gotten hurt too.

487
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,190
Will you be okay by yourself?

488
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,569
Dr. Kang's such an excellent doctor.

489
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,488
I noticed that one of the hostages
is a nursing major.

490
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,198
She can have them help her.

491
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,034
I'll be okay by myself.

492
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,455
We'll do our best to get you out safely
once you're done.

493
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,794
And agent Jang Han-na
will assist you well.

494
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,994
This is the list of the captured students.

495
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,543
Does any of them have an illness?

496
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,545
Why?

497
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,089
Just tell me if there's anyone
who must get out.

498
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,807
Those with illnesses are hard to handle,

499
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,852
but there are other students
harder to control.

500
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,855
This one sleepwalks every night.

501
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,109
And this one fearlessly protests
while throwing petrol bombs.

502
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,656
And this one's a nut job who always does

503
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,991
what I tell her not to do.

504
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,128
Think about it.

505
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,714
They knew they'd be kicked out
if they broke the rules.

506
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:32,094
But they still deceived me
as well as ANSP agents…

507
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,639
They hid you inside the bench
in the sauna, didn't they?

508
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,724
Being all naked. Who does that?

509
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,686
They're so daring.

510
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,106
Yes, they're obedient for now,

511
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,150
but as time passes by,
they'll be hard to control.

512
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,569
If you think the girls are easy to handle,

513
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,113
you'll get in trouble.

514
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,288
It doesn't have to be students, does it?

515
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,583
<i>I said, shut your mouths!</i>

516
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,795
I'm sorry.

517
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,939
I will keep my mouth shut.

518
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,357
Keep your heads down.

519
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,491
Everyone raise your heads.

520
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,005
I'll release some of you right now.

521
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,429
As for the rest of you, I'll release

522
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,099
those who are cooperative
next time or the next time after that.

523
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,146
But for those who disobey us

524
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,732
and are uncooperative,

525
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,944
there will be no release.

526
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,198
I, Oh Gwang-tea, will always

527
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,867
be cooperative.

528
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,410
I swear.

529
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,415
If you understood, be wise about it.

530
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,182
If your name is called,

531
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,392
stand up.

532
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,613
Mr. Eun, they're calling names.

533
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,287
Yeo Jeong-min.

534
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:09,835
<i>Ko Yu-na.</i>

535
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,169
Thank God!

536
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,799
-Shin Gyeong-ja.
-Here.

537
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,927
Ko Hye-ryeong.

538
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,973
I knew it!
I knew this wouldn't be the end of me.

539
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,730
Seo Eun-gyo.

540
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,607
Thank you!

541
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,608
Kim Ye-won.

542
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,403
<i>-Park Seon-ja.
-Here.</i>

543
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,946
<i>Kang Tae-ji.</i>

544
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,115
Yoon Seol-hui.

545
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,202
Thank you!

546
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,372
Three from room 207?

547
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,291
It's suspicious.

548
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,333
You're right.

549
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,751
It must be because of Yeong-ro.

550
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,588
What's this? Yeong-ro's roommates
are being treated specially?

551
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,506
This is so unfair.

552
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,092
Tell me about it. It's so obvious.

553
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,469
-That can't be.
-It's possible.

554
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,721
Of course it is.

555
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,058
Quiet!

556
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,397
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:16,276
Can I tell you about myself a bit?

558
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,029
I, Oh Gwang-tae, grew up

559
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,990
with a single mom,
and like that wasn't enough,

560
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,161
I've gotten hepatitis A.

561
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,454
If I stay here--

562
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,372
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,416
We'll never release you.

564
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,793
But I'm telling the truth.

565
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,463
-I really have it. I swear.
-Stop.

566
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,839
Forget what I said.

567
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,633
You're such a loser.

568
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,473
Eun Yeong-ro.

569
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,355
That's it.

570
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,358
Eun Yeong-ro?

571
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,199
Eun Yeong-ro.

572
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,081
You can't do this.

573
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,917
Be quiet, Bun-ok.

574
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,252
You didn't ever hear us out.

575
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,337
Why are you only releasing students?

576
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,341
What about me, Mr. Kim, and Ms. Oh?
We can't even get a chance?

577
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,385
This is unfair!

578
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,554
On what grounds did you decide on this?

579
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,516
On what grounds!

580
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,767
Shut your mouth!

581
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,186
She's so feisty.

582
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,482
This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?

583
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,860
She can't die and I can?

584
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,544
She's right.

585
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,047
Bun-ok is right.

586
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,009
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

587
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,345
<i>Release someone else.</i>

588
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,766
How can I leave when they can't?

589
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,686
That's not right.

590
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,692
I'll stay too.

591
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,738
I played a big part too.

592
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,614
If Yeong-ro stays,

593
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,451
I can't just leave her here
to save my skin.

594
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,788
Why don't we just draw lots?
That'll be fair.

595
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,795
I totally agree!

596
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,714
-I agree.
-So do I.

597
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,977
Shut up! Quiet!

598
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,285
RÉSUMÉ
KYE BUN-OK

599
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,333
She's our telephone operator.

600
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,169
She's looking after her sick parents.

601
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,798
She's a poor girl
who's the sole breadwinner.

602
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,301
I really hope you'll release her.

603
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,721
You were the last one.

604
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,521
But not anymore.

605
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,624
You'll never get a chance to be released.

606
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,805
When I said those who disobey us
and are uncooperative

607
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,308
wouldn't be released,
you should've taken it seriously.

608
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,147
Drawing lots?

609
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,193
I decide who gets released.

610
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,868
Hold on. Wait!

611
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:43,126
In any case, we're being released, right?

612
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,470
Hey!

613
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,022
Because of that stupid Gizzard…

614
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,735
What a wench!

615
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,902
AREA 2-1
WIRETAPPED

616
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,035
Mr. An.

617
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,291
Gang-mu must be locked up
and sending us a message.

618
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,841
It seems
the hostages are locked in the cafeteria

619
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:18,012
and Gang-mu is
locked in room 203 separately.

620
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,350
I think he's tied up in a separate room.

621
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,729
According to the blueprint, the distance
between the cafeteria and the room

622
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,524
is about 30 meters and…

623
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,366
I have a favor to ask.

624
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,619
Of course, you don't have to do it

625
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,415
because if we get caught,
you'll be put in danger too.

626
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:49,419
If that's the case,
let me hear you out first.

627
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,591
This.

628
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
I want to give this to Mr. Lee.

629
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,889
How about we hide it in the medical kit?

630
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,518
They know who I am,
so it's impossible for me to bring it.

631
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,568
-Is the doctor ready?
<i>-Before that,</i>

632
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,279
I need to check if the students are safe.

633
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,822
What are you trying to pull again?

634
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,657
To check if they're safe

635
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,743
and to protect the doctor,

636
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,828
one of our agents will accompany her.

637
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,122
And please let the doctor
treat our agent too.

638
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,540
Look.

639
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,587
I can't guarantee what will happen
if they try anything else.

640
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,799
I give you my word.

641
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,654
Jang.

642
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,738
Yes, sir.

643
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,909
They promised to let Gang-mu be treated.

644
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,453
So check if the students are okay first.

645
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,704
Yes, sir.

646
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,736
Stop there.

647
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,408
Put down the bag.

648
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,465
Open it.

649
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,227
Now.

650
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,908
Step back.

651
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,675
They're medical tools.

652
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,469
Please be careful not to contaminate them.

653
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:36,914
Go upstairs.

654
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,550
Go over it.

655
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,309
Just follow me.

656
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:13,242
Where are the hostages?

657
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,964
Gang-mu is with them, right?

658
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,382
Shut it.

659
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,636
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

660
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,266
<i>And Gang-mu is</i>

661
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,769
locked in room 203 separately.

662
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:44,732
To your left.

663
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,464
Comrade Lim.

664
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,038
Move faster.

665
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,887
Comrade Joo, get the doctor here first.

666
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,976
I need someone to assist me.

667
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,895
I heard there's a nursing major here.

668
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,274
Kim Dong-ji.

669
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,525
Yes, ma'am.

670
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,528
She's the one.

671
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,906
Can you help me?

672
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,581
He's been running a fever since dawn.

673
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,474
If he's over 38°C, he can't have surgery.

674
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,642
I must give him
a fever reducer and antibiotics

675
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,394
to reduce the fever first.

676
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,233
I heard two of you are injured.

677
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,069
Where's the other one?

678
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,489
Comrade Joo.

679
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,126
Get treated.

680
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,117
Hello, sir. This is
Hong Ae-ra. You remember me, right?

681
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,369
I called to ask you something.

682
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:48,457
You told me the other day
that for my husband to become president,

683
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,836
13 young virgins must
be offered as sacrifices, right?

684
01:08:55,214 --> 01:09:00,094
But does it have to be exactly 13 people?

685
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,016
Oh, I see.

686
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,646
Thank you. I'll come visit you soon.

687
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,820
Ma'am, it's all ready.

688
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,461
I can see all of the 64 hostages are safe.

689
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,589
How many of them will you release?

690
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,180
Rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

691
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:49,018
The doctor needs to treat them anyway,

692
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,855
so why don't you just release them too?

693
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,778
I think that'll be better for both of us.

694
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,409
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

695
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,036
Here!

696
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,204
What's going on?

697
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,915
Hey, Ms. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong?

698
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,208
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

699
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,709
Hold on.

700
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,170
Drink water.

701
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:19,298
What's wrong?
Do you have trouble breathing?

702
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,382
Attention.

703
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,596
I'll select people who will be released.

704
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,648
<i>If you disobey me this time again,</i>

705
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,567
you won't get out of here alive.

706
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,285
You.

707
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,791
You.

708
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,835
<i>You.</i>

709
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,463
<i>You.</i>

710
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,340
"You"? Damn it.

711
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,009
Why isn't this bastard
calling their names?

712
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,387
Who is he picking?

713
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,973
Don't you think we need to find it out?

714
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:13,310
Damn it. My blood pressure.

715
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,354
The six of you will get out too.

716
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,990
God damn bastard.

717
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,242
Everyone I selected, come out.

718
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,043
Yu-na.

719
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,712
What's wrong, Yu-na?

720
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,256
-He's having trouble breathing.
-What's wrong?

721
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,925
-Are you okay?
-Yu-na.

722
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,262
-Go get a plastic bag. Now!
-I'll go.

723
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,267
Yu-na, you're okay.

724
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,978
You won't die. Everything will be okay.

725
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,688
Have her breathe into it. Hurry.

726
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,858
Breathe. Breathe deeply.

727
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,611
Deeply and slowly.

728
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,659
I'm so scared.

729
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,705
I think the stress is too much for her.

730
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,000
Can't you release her too?

731
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,044
Me too!

732
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,962
-I can't stand it any longer!
-Me too!

733
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,673
-Me too!
-Me too!

734
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:25,883
-Me too!
-Me too!

735
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:28,344
-Me too!
-It should be us!

736
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,304
-This is a women's dorm!
-Me too!

737
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,306
-Why do I have to keep quiet?
-Me too!

738
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,726
-Listen to what we have to say too!
-Me too!

739
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,854
-Let us men go too!
-Me too!

740
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,481
-God damn it!
-Me too!

741
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,775
-Why do we have to be here?
-Me too!

742
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,109
Enough!

743
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,030
Who wants to die first?

744
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:49,698
Who?

745
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:50,824
Stop!

746
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,515
Who are you to decide who gets to live?

747
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,561
<i>Only I will be enough.</i>

748
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,774
<i>I'll stay, so release all of them.</i>

749
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,567
Let them all go!

750
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,746
Keep your heads down!

751
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,420
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

752
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,926
You leave.

753
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,265
This is our dorm.

754
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,309
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

755
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,313
Oh, my goodness.

756
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,484
-You're not done.
-Let go.

757
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,236
I'll kill this damn wench.

758
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,852
Please let them go. They're innocent.

759
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,750
You…

760
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,629
You don't know who I am, do you?

761
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,854
I'll tell you.

762
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,069
I'm…

763
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:36,490
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

764
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,417
Eun Chang-su,

765
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,254
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

766
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,091
is my father.

767
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,043
She hid him? Hid the communist spy?
Your daughter really did it?

768
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,755
<i>Does hiding a spy count as espionage?</i>

769
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,260
<i>You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?</i>

770
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,264
You son of a b****!

771
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:44,725
<i>I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.</i>

772
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,393
What kind of deal did you make?

773
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:49,479
<i>We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.</i>

774
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,732
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars?

775
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:55,485
<i>I'm sure our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.</i>

776
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:57,571
Kill them.

777
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:01,325
Director Eun Chang-su won't
even find his daughter's body.

778
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:03,577
Please.

779
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,245
Kill me.

BONUS

782
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:25,932
-One, two.
-Careful.

783
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,268
We must take them down
before they blow themselves up!

784
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,563
What if we break in rashly
and get the hostages killed, you bastard?

785
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,939
What? "Bastard"?

786
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,316
How dare you call me that?

787
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,653
Just get lost. This is my jurisdiction!

788
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,030
You always dilly-dally and are indecisive,

789
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:43,367
and that's why all this has happened.
You're a liability to us!

790
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:47,287
You always blame others,
and that's why this is happening!

791
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,373
Whose fault is this?

792
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,334
A soft boy like you can
never serve the country well.

793
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,253
You killed your former superior
on the pretext of serving the country.

794
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,880
Do you call that serving the country?

795
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,966
What do you know about revolution?

796
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,678
Just discipline your son better.

797
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,764
You piece of s***, how dare you talk
about my son with your dirty mouth?

798
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:10,686
What did you say? Do you want to die?
I must've gone too easy on you!

799
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,396
<i>What? "Gone easy on me"?</i>

800
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,564
<i>-You God damn bastard!
-Let go, you s***!</i>

801
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:15,649
<i>I'll just--</i>

802
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,693
<i>-Get lost already!
-God damn it!</i>
