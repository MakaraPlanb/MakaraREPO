Comrade Joo.

00:36:57.715 --> 00:37:00.134 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget the party
ordered you to obey my orders.

00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.817 line:85.83%,end
You think the party trusts you,
but you're mistaken.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:21.864 line:85.83%,end
If I sense any change
in your ideology, I can--

00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:05.366 line:85.83%,end
Why did you disobey my orders
and follow me into Mount Ogong?

00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:11.455 line:85.83%,end
If you disobey my orders again,

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:13.749 line:85.83%,end
then…

00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:18.254 line:85.83%,end
I won't shoot here.

00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:23.175 line:85.83%,end
I'll shoot here.

00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:27.054 line:85.83%,end
Your life depends on me, your leader.

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:30.474 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget that.

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:45.239 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim…

00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:53.998 line:85.83%,end
The rifle!

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.065 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Oh?

00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:27.823 line:85.83%,end
Oh, no.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:50.679 line:85.83%,end
Bang!

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:54.934 line:85.83%,end
Bang!

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.145 line:85.83%,end
Bang!

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.605 line:85.83%,end
Bang!

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:06.070 line:85.83%,end
Bang!

00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:09.573 line:85.83%,end
My goodness. My arm hurts so much.

00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:11.826 line:85.83%,end
-Gosh.
-She's not herself right now.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.786 line:85.83%,end
The rifle is so heavy.

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.622 line:85.83%,end
Stop it and come here.

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:21.794 line:85.83%,end
Yes. All right. Just sit down.

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:22.711 line:85.83%,end
Sit now.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:34.557 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho?

00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:36.767 line:85.83%,end
We have an injured person.

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:39.478 line:85.83%,end
-Send a doctor in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:42.398 line:85.83%,end
But how about you release
some of them in return?

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:45.276 line:85.83%,end
You have too many hostages
for the three of you anyway.

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:48.988 line:85.83%,end
Send in a doctor in ten minutes.

00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:50.739 line:85.83%,end
We need more time.

00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:54.618 line:85.83%,end
We'll find a doctor as soon as possible,
so release some of them first.

00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:56.078 line:85.83%,end
You have 20 minutes.

00:40:56.787 --> 00:41:00.082 line:85.83%,end
<i>If a doctor doesn't come in here by 9:44,</i>

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.336 line:85.83%,end
I'll execute
one hostage every ten minutes.

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:12.094 line:85.83%,end
Hey, find a doctor right away.
We only got 20 minutes.

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:13.429 line:85.83%,end
20 minutes?

00:41:13.512 --> 00:41:16.098 line:85.83%,end
Even our agency doctor
can't get here in 20 minutes.

00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:17.266 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:20.769 line:85.83%,end
I see.

00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:26.525 line:85.83%,end
Those damn bastards, are they trying
to train us like some freaking dog?

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:31.113 line:85.83%,end
Why are you dilly-dallying when you can
just break in and wipe them out?

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:34.492 line:85.83%,end
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.536 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya speaking.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.704 line:85.83%,end
Hey, where are you?

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:40.456 line:85.83%,end
<i>What do you mean?</i>

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:41.957 line:85.83%,end
You called me at the hospital.

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:44.251 line:85.83%,end
That's good. Come
to the Hosu University dorm right now.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.420 line:85.83%,end
Yes. It'll take
less than ten minutes, right?

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:47.963 line:85.83%,end
<i>Why do you want me there?</i>

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.426 line:85.83%,end
The spies' hostage situation?
