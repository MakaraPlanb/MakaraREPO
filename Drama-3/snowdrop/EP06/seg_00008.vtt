00:41:54.553 --> 00:41:56.555 line:85.83%,end
<i>Come over here right now! To the scene!</i>

00:42:18.452 --> 00:42:19.370 line:85.83%,end
We'll escort you.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:24.833 line:85.83%,end
Open it!

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.962 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry up!
-Open it!

00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:35.427 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll disguise</i>

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.346 line:85.83%,end
Han-na as a nurse, send her in,

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:40.891 line:85.83%,end
and rescue your daughter first
no matter what.

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:45.062 line:85.83%,end
But if we act rashly,
it'll put the hostages in more danger.

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:46.814 line:85.83%,end
This is the perfect chance.

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:50.401 line:85.83%,end
If this drags on and they find out
she's your daughter, then it will…

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:53.821 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry to say this,

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.699 line:85.83%,end
but something tragic might happen.

00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:04.498 line:85.83%,end
But Han-na wasn't very prudent yesterday.

00:43:05.624 --> 00:43:06.542 line:85.83%,end
Is she reliable?

00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:10.421 line:85.83%,end
Disguise myself as a nurse?

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:12.089 line:85.83%,end
But they must know my face.

00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:13.716 line:85.83%,end
None of them knows your face.

00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.593 line:85.83%,end
They saw you briefly during the shoot-out.

00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:20.139 line:85.83%,end
I even spoke with them.

00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:22.516 line:85.83%,end
Do you remember
when I lost Han while tailing him?

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.184 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure they set us up.

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.562 line:85.83%,end
They must know my face.

00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:29.440 line:85.83%,end
In any case, go in with the doctor

00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:32.610 line:85.83%,end
and rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:36.071 line:85.83%,end
And how will I do that?

00:43:36.655 --> 00:43:39.742 line:85.83%,end
It might put the rest in more danger.
Don't you know that?

00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:42.786 line:85.83%,end
How am I supposed to pull off
the special op without equipment?

00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:46.373 line:85.83%,end
You're known for this kind of thing.

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.876 line:85.83%,end
You don't need any equipment.
Use your brain.

00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:54.214 line:85.83%,end
<i>Sweetie,</i>

00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:56.925 line:85.83%,end
you know how much I love you, right?

00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:00.638 line:85.83%,end
Cut to the chase. I came because
you said it was urgent. What is it?

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:04.350 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell me
I have to treat those Northern spies.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.275 line:85.83%,end
There are three spies in there,
and two of them are injured.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:14.777 line:85.83%,end
Spies?

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.819 line:85.83%,end
Forget it.

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:16.862 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:19.073 line:85.83%,end
If I take care of this well,

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.116 line:85.83%,end
my party will support me in the future.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.869 line:85.83%,end
And it'll help me become president.

00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.996 line:85.83%,end
You said you wanted to see me become one.

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.582 line:85.83%,end
If you, my beloved sweetie,

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:33.087 line:85.83%,end
kill two of them with injections
pretending treating their wounds,

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.255 line:85.83%,end
-then only one will be left.
-"Kill"?

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.885 line:85.83%,end
Are you seriously
telling me to commit murder?

00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:43.639 line:85.83%,end
It's not murder. It's execution.

00:44:43.722 --> 00:44:47.017 line:85.83%,end
There are 60 innocent college girls
being held in there.

00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:49.228 line:85.83%,end
By executing those spies,

00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:52.731 line:85.83%,end
you'll be saving the 60 innocent people.

00:44:57.194 --> 00:45:00.072 line:85.83%,end
You thought I'd be moved by such nonsense?

00:45:02.741 --> 00:45:06.537 line:85.83%,end
If I become president of this country,

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.206 line:85.83%,end
I'll be able to abandon
my four-star father-in-law

00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:11.500 line:85.83%,end
and leave my dumb wife.

00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:14.753 line:85.83%,end
I doubt that.

00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.173 line:85.83%,end
My life wish is

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.761 line:85.83%,end
to keep you by my side 24/7

00:45:22.845 --> 00:45:24.096 line:85.83%,end
for the rest of my life.

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:26.348 line:85.83%,end
You know that.

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:31.854 line:85.83%,end
Let's say I've taken care of the two.

00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:34.356 line:85.83%,end
What if the last one tries to kill me?

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:40.362 line:85.83%,end
Do you really think I'd put you in danger
without any contingency plan?

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:42.656 line:85.83%,end
Contingency plan?

00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:46.785 line:85.83%,end
<i>Soon, the whole building</i>

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.037 line:85.83%,end
<i>will be wiretapped.</i>

00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.790 line:85.83%,end
<i>Once you take care of the two,</i>

00:45:51.874 --> 00:45:54.543 line:85.83%,end
<i>just say, "I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."</i>

00:45:54.626 --> 00:45:58.130 line:85.83%,end
<i>Once we hear you say that,
our forces will break in secretly</i>

00:45:58.213 --> 00:46:00.299 line:85.83%,end
<i>and kill the last one.</i>

00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:05.929 line:85.83%,end
But they're just three spies.

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:08.766 line:85.83%,end
Do you have to pull this kind of trick?

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:14.104 line:85.83%,end
What I want is simple.
I just want to break in and kill them all.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.273 line:85.83%,end
But…

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.320 line:85.83%,end
it turned out Eun's daughter
is one of the hostages.

00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:25.866 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun's daughter?

00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:31.163 line:85.83%,end
I can't just do as I want
beside the anxious father.

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.749 line:85.83%,end
So it came to this.

00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:41.048 line:85.83%,end
Even if you're asking, I'm a doctor.
I can't kill a person. No, I won't.

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:44.176 line:85.83%,end
Please. Do this for me, honey.

00:46:44.259 --> 00:46:45.552 line:85.83%,end
-Please.
-Instead,

00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:48.889 line:85.83%,end
I'll add sleep-inducing element
to the painkiller

00:46:49.097 --> 00:46:50.474 line:85.83%,end
and make them unconscious.

00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:57.022 line:85.83%,end
You wicked little fox.
