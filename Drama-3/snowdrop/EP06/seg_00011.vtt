When I said those who disobey us
and are uncooperative

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.308 line:85.83%,end
wouldn't be released,
you should've taken it seriously.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.147 line:85.83%,end
Drawing lots?

00:57:25.483 --> 00:57:27.193 line:85.83%,end
I decide who gets released.

00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:34.868 line:85.83%,end
Hold on. Wait!

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:43.126 line:85.83%,end
In any case, we're being released, right?

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.470 line:85.83%,end
Hey!

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:04.022 line:85.83%,end
Because of that stupid Gizzard…

00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:08.735 line:85.83%,end
What a wench!

00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:50.902 line:85.83%,end
AREA 2-1
WIRETAPPED

00:58:58.159 --> 00:58:59.035 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An.

00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:05.291 line:85.83%,end
Gang-mu must be locked up
and sending us a message.

00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:13.841 line:85.83%,end
It seems
the hostages are locked in the cafeteria

00:59:13.925 --> 00:59:18.012 line:85.83%,end
and Gang-mu is
locked in room 203 separately.

00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:22.350 line:85.83%,end
I think he's tied up in a separate room.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:26.729 line:85.83%,end
According to the blueprint, the distance
between the cafeteria and the room

00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:29.524 line:85.83%,end
is about 30 meters and…

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.366 line:85.83%,end
I have a favor to ask.

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:41.619 line:85.83%,end
Of course, you don't have to do it

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:45.415 line:85.83%,end
because if we get caught,
you'll be put in danger too.

00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:49.419 line:85.83%,end
If that's the case,
let me hear you out first.

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:54.591 line:85.83%,end
This.

00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:57.927 line:85.83%,end
I want to give this to Mr. Lee.

00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.889 line:85.83%,end
How about we hide it in the medical kit?

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.518 line:85.83%,end
They know who I am,
so it's impossible for me to bring it.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.568 line:85.83%,end
-Is the doctor ready?
<i>-Before that,</i>

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.279 line:85.83%,end
I need to check if the students are safe.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.822 line:85.83%,end
What are you trying to pull again?

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:19.657 line:85.83%,end
To check if they're safe

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:21.743 line:85.83%,end
and to protect the doctor,

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.828 line:85.83%,end
one of our agents will accompany her.

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.122 line:85.83%,end
And please let the doctor
treat our agent too.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.540 line:85.83%,end
Look.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.587 line:85.83%,end
I can't guarantee what will happen
if they try anything else.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:36.799 line:85.83%,end
I give you my word.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.654 line:85.83%,end
Jang.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:58.738 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.909 line:85.83%,end
They promised to let Gang-mu be treated.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.453 line:85.83%,end
So check if the students are okay first.

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:06.704 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.
