EPISODE 6

3
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:27,868
Now…

4
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,746
Plan B is the only option now.

5
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,248
And in order for it to succeed,

6
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,335
we must kill them all.

7
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,049
As soon as they come out,

8
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:44,676
-kill them all.
-Mr. Nam,

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,680
even if we go with plan B, if we kill
them, the North won't sit back--

10
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:49,598
What if they won't?

11
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,975
We made a deal--

12
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,153
You think they'll disclose
that we made a deal?

13
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,656
We have no choice but
to exaggerate the engagement.

14
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,659
If the North throws a monkey wrench
into the works, it'll fail!

15
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:11,286
You think they're that stupid?

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,289
You think they'll refuse the chance
to make huge money every election?

17
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,584
But if it fails,
the hostages' lives will be in danger!

18
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:18,669
God damn it!

19
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,297
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

20
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,842
Everyone, retreat.

21
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:43,652
This is HQ. Ambush team,
we're going in for the kill.

22
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,654
Once the targets are in the zone,

23
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,197
kill them at all costs.

24
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:32,534
The targets appeared. All units,
they're approaching the kill zone.

25
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,702
Stand by.

26
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,961
Let's go.

27
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,383
Stop.

28
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:06,735
Three targets, armed with AK-47s.

29
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,977
A change of plan. Open fire.

30
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:46,858
Eung-cheol!

31
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,252
Everyone, calm down.

32
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:08,714
I think they're trying to escape
through the exit in basement two.

33
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,341
And I'll go after them right now.

34
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,302
So everyone stay here.

35
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:17,347
Let's go.

36
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,203
Eung-cheol, hold me.

37
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,679
You bastards!

38
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,432
It's a grenade! Get down!

39
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,438
All units, fire!

40
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,782
Get out of here! Hurry up!

41
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,046
Four of our guys are injured.

42
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,298
It looks like the plan failed.

43
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,262
I'll kill them all.

44
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,283
Eung-cheol!

45
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:01,618
Get it together.

46
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:37,404
<i>We're going in.
We'll go in and secure the targets.</i>

47
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,822
Hey, halt! Halt!

48
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:40,866
This is the director of ANSP. Halt!

49
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,543
If the students are killed,
we'll be doomed!

50
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,714
Why do you think
this happened in the first place?

51
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:58,175
Exaggerating the engagement won't help us!

52
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:01,052
Let's just go in and eliminate them all!

53
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,889
Are you insane?
What if all the hostages are killed?

54
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,349
I'll deal with the communist jerks,

55
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,768
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

56
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,062
SWAT team, listen--

57
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,149
If you stab them in the back twice,
how will you negotiate with them?

58
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:16,902
You think you can bury this
without anyone knowing?

59
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,807
You made sure
no one will talk about this, right?

60
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,477
If anyone asks about this
hostage situation, just lock them all up!

61
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,728
We already

62
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:37,065
took necessary measures just in case.

63
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,109
We told the shop owners

64
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:42,696
that we were catching deserters.
And we made sure

65
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,281
to keep the press quiet about it.

66
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:46,491
But your daughter…

67
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,001
Do you think the other hostages are okay?

68
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,795
Put me through to the dorm.

69
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:22,986
You bastard.

70
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:48,678
You son of a b****!

71
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,192
You murderer.

72
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:05,945
You bastard!

73
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:11,534
How dare you kill my husband?

74
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:23,380
Who gave you the right to kill him?

75
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:31,346
You murderer!

76
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,140
How dare you!

77
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,353
Bring her here.

78
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,898
You're all right. Calm down.

79
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:28,862
Twice.

80
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,448
They deceived us twice!

81
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,368
You wasted our precious bullets.

82
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:39,038
It's always an emotional prick
like you that ruins a mission.

83
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,460
You need to be coolheaded
in a situation like this.

84
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,255
If you keep this up,
I won't need you anymore.

85
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,264
Everyone go back to the cafeteria.

86
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,894
Now!

87
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:16,409
I'll watch the cafeteria.
You go bring Eung-cheol.

88
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:19,537
And lock him in another room.

89
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,166
You two.

90
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:25,960
Follow me.

91
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,674
Yes, sir!

92
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,609
Yes.

93
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:52,320
Sir.

94
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:53,822
It's the military situation room.

95
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:06,042
Hey, have you looked into the casualties?

96
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,294
Ask about Han I-seop first.

97
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,631
Yes, sir!
All of the armed spies were killed.

98
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:16,636
And Professor Han who was with them
was killed by one of the Northern spies.

99
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,679
Is he dead?

100
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,266
How about our casualties?

101
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:24,769
One killed in action
and four injured, sir.

102
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:27,814
Yeong-u!

103
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:30,233
Yeong-u, stay with me!

104
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:34,279
You'll be okay. Hang in there.

105
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,001
Don't tell their families just yet.

106
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,628
And ask the press for a news embargo.

107
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,134
Here. We need help here.

108
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,430
Chief An.

109
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:03,308
Tell the press that Han I-seop died
while defecting to the North.

110
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,727
-Defecting to the North?
-Yes.

111
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,313
<i>But he was the
opposition party's mentor in economics.</i>

112
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,480
An.

113
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,442
Just tell them the North abducted him
and we tried to rescue him.

114
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,403
Inspiring the people's sense
of national security will help us--

115
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:19,282
You want to stop there
when we can win the game?

116
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:22,744
If the opposition party raises an issue,
we will be counterattacked.

117
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:34,339
Counterattack?

118
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:39,302
Making up evidence with a dead guy is
just a piece of cake. What counterattack?

119
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:43,890
Will the higher-ups be content with
inspiring a sense of national security?

120
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,439
Do it.

121
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,442
I'll tell them right now
he was trying to defect to the North.

122
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,236
<i>Of course, he'd kill them.</i>

123
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,405
<i>You know how people are willing</i>

124
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,199
to kill their own family,

125
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,452
cousins, and even children
if it helps them become king.

126
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,287
So why would he be any different?

127
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:11,334
Come on. You know how much
Ms. Hong care for his daughter.

128
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,587
Your own child means

129
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,798
more than anything in the world.

130
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:22,845
I feel like a horrible person.

131
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,390
As soon as I heard
about the hostage situation,

132
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:27,725
the first thing I thought of
is the fortuneteller.

133
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,938
She's not even your own daughter.

134
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:35,108
I must say,
you're such an angel, Ms. Hong.

135
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,736
Are you

136
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:42,323
very worried that 13 people will die

137
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:44,409
in the dorm?

138
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:47,286
What?

139
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,249
That must be why
you ran over here so late at night.

140
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,251
I ran over here

141
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,336
so late at night?

142
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,133
They say you can never hide
your humble origins.

143
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,718
How could you be so rude?

144
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:05,555
Don't you know my husband is
your husband's superior?

145
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,973
Charlotte.

146
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:10,768
You know that my husband graduated
from the military academy

147
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,228
four years earlier than him?

148
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:14,355
Pardon?

149
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,609
Well, yes. That's…

150
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:22,405
Yes, I'm aware of that.

151
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:26,534
They say the boughs that bear the most
hang the lowest.

152
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,829
I know the higher-up likes your husband,

153
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,373
but he might end up paying dearly

154
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,377
for disrespecting his senior.
I'm quite worried.

155
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:39,422
Worried?

156
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,799
You're worried?

157
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:43,801
You wench!

158
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,804
How dare a lowly entertainer like you
threaten me?

159
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm a daughter of a general.
A four-star general!

160
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,438
My goodness. Ma'am, please calm down.

161
00:16:56,105 --> 00:17:00,151
Hey, your husband rose
from humble origins.

162
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:04,405
Mine has many high-ranking in-laws.
You think they're on the same level?

163
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,451
Your husband becoming president.

164
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:10,703
Don't even dream about it.

165
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:14,123
It's not something
a lowlife like you can covet!

166
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:25,176
Ms. Hong, I'll get going too.

167
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:46,572
<i>He definitely ordered us
to cooperate with the South.</i>

168
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:52,954
<i>Father must've made a deal with
the director of ANSP to save our lives.</i>

169
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:04,006
<i>Then why did they…</i>

170
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,760
<i>try to kill us?</i>

171
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:36,372
I laid Comrade Lee down
in the next room. He's severely injured.

172
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:38,040
I'll go to him with the first aid kit.

173
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,172
You.

174
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,804
Follow me with the first aid kit.

175
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,776
-Why is he taking her?
-I don't know.

176
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:07,904
Keep your heads down.

177
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:16,704
Eung-cheol.

178
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,458
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:32,094
Wait.

180
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,187
I said, wait.

181
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:53,658
I'm okay, sir.

182
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:55,660
No, you're not, you punk.

183
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,853
Fortunately,
you didn't hurt any arteries or veins.

184
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:26,232
I could even take
an axe blade with my abs.

185
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,901
So this wound is nothing.

186
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:30,903
I can survive this.

187
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:24,165
It should be treated.

188
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:49,315
Let everyone go.

189
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:01,869
If you feel bad for me just a little bit,

190
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,873
let them go. Please.

191
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:14,131
Let them go.

192
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:30,022
Tomorrow morning, I'll demand a doctor
who will treat Eung-cheol's wound.

193
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:33,442
They'll demand the release of a hostage.

194
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,070
And I'm…

195
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:40,533
planning to release you.

196
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:46,664
To repay you for what you've done
for me these past few days.

197
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:50,584
We'll be even then.

198
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,007
"Even"?

199
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,352
Go back to the cafeteria.

200
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,214
Look at her.

201
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:39,425
Her hand is bandaged.

202
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,470
-What? Bandage?
-She's right.

203
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:43,888
He treated her?

204
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:46,098
But why treat only her?

205
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:37,483
Lim Soo-ho?

206
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:40,110
Are you guys okay?

207
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:42,738
I'll speak to the person in charge.

208
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,492
There are people who don't agree with me,
so it went awry.

209
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,078
<i>But I'm still willing to get you out</i>

210
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,704
safely and--

211
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:53,832
I'll talk to the person
who ordered to kill us.

212
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,544
I'm the person in charge here.
I'm the director of ANSP.

213
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,551
So you're the one
who ordered to kill us, you bastard?

214
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,302
What? "Bastard"?

215
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,888
How dare this communist call you that?

216
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:11,183
Give it. I'll teach him a lesson. Give it!

217
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,102
Stop it, you idiot!

218
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:19,942
Don't deal with him. Why don't you
go home? I'll take care of this.

219
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,652
You'll take care of this?

220
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:22,903
Why don't you go home?

221
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:25,698
You're not coolheaded,
desperate to save your child.

222
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:26,615
You little…

223
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,786
Are you trying to get her killed?

224
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,081
If they find out,
what do you think they'll do?

225
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,172
What're you looking at?

226
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:51,724
There was an engagement on the West Sea
at around 22:00.

227
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:54,560
An engagement?

228
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:58,272
<i>The ship for the North was
stupid enough to be get caught.</i>

229
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:03,277
The navy found the ship,
so there was nothing I could do.

230
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,030
And my colleagues?

231
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:06,947
<i>Before that…</i>

232
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,075
I heard gunfire. Are the students okay?

233
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:17,124
If you wanted them safe,
you shouldn't have deceived us twice.

234
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:22,129
What happened to my colleagues?

235
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:24,465
Unfortunately,

236
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:28,093
everyone was killed
including Professor Han.

237
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:30,721
Everyone?

238
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,683
How can I believe you?

239
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,226
Whether or not you believe me,

240
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,521
I want to help you.

241
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:42,566
<i>Give me a bit more time,
and I'll come up with a plan--</i>

242
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,109
When you tried to kill us,

243
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:50,074
had the North approved it?

244
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,534
Of course not. We had no time for that.

245
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,246
Remember this.

246
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,877
Once we're convinced we're never
going back alive, we'll blow ourselves up.

247
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,005
And all the hostages will die too.

248
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:29,238
<i>You must accomplish
this mission at all costs, okay?</i>

249
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,534
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

250
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,786
<i>are pointing a gun at me.</i>

251
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:40,207
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

252
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,542
Don't forget that.

253
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:57,891
Mom…

254
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:58,155
PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR KIM IL SUNG,
DEAR LEADER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE

255
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,951
Because your son failed the mission,

256
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:05,287
we lost 300 million dollars.

257
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,205
The party's 300 million dollars.

258
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:10,792
Have you forgotten our Leader
ordered us to get it done at all costs?

259
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:13,587
It's too early

260
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,506
to say the mission has failed.

261
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:19,760
Too early?

262
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,138
You think your son,
who's holding people hostage

263
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:24,765
in the middle of Seoul,

264
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:28,143
will come back with 300 million dollars?

265
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:34,191
The party will make a decision soon.
Prepare yourself.

266
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:44,201
We failed our mission,
so there's only one option left for us.

267
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:48,080
To kill them all

268
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,625
and blow ourselves up.

269
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:57,923
It's too early for that. We must try
our best to go back alive until the end.

270
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,217
I'll buy as much time as--

271
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,095
We shouldn't beg them for negotiation.
Blowing ourselves up…

272
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,433
is the only way
to defend the honor of our Leader.

273
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,108
We'll be dying for nothing.

274
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:18,902
Dying for nothing?

275
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,999
You son of a b****.

276
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,668
You dare to call it dying for nothing?

277
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:39,548
To shoot all the hostages dead

278
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:42,300
and blow ourselves up in a determined way

279
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:44,886
is the most honorable death for us!

280
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:49,433
I'll decide if we must die or not.

281
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:51,727
I'm your leader.

282
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,439
You're just a soft guy
from a powerful family. How dare you

283
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:57,024
disrespect the revolutionary spirit?

284
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:01,028
It would've gone smoothly
if you hadn't come to the dorm!

285
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,622
Hey, Yeong-ro. Do something.

286
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:15,000
You and he must be close.

287
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,710
Do something for us!

288
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:18,462
What could she do?

289
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:21,673
we were also fooled.
She didn't know he was a spy either.

290
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:22,799
She didn't?

291
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,135
Look what she got us into.
"I didn't know" won't cut it.

292
00:33:25,218 --> 00:33:27,971
You guys from room 207
are accomplices. So be quiet.

293
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:31,683
Accomplices?
Look, I'm also mad at Yeong-ro.

294
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,186
I told you we shouldn't have hid him!

295
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:41,234
But it is true that we really thought
he was a college student we met on a date.

296
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,528
And you met him with us.

297
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:47,407
She's right.
And he was your partner that day.

298
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:48,825
-Partner?
-Bun-ok's partner?

299
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:50,077
She joined them?

300
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:52,788
So you think you did nothing wrong?

301
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,414
Stop arguing!

302
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,291
The ANSP agent was just dragged out.

303
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,044
We must find a way to get out alive.

304
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:00,420
Why take it out on me?

305
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,215
You think we can find any way
in this situation?

306
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,885
Byeong-tae!

307
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,428
Do something.

308
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:11,765
You'll be commissioned soon.
Will you just sit back?

309
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:14,810
Isn't there any manual
for a situation like this?

310
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:16,895
Actually…

311
00:34:20,774 --> 00:34:22,192
There's nothing in particular.

312
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:26,822
But…

313
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,410
With my great leadership

314
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:35,413
and sense of duty to save your lives,
let me tell you something.

315
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:39,417
In 1972, there was a hostage situation
during the Munich Olympics.

316
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:43,296
And the West German police
dealt with it in such an idiotic way,

317
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,506
so all the hostages

318
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:46,299
were killed.

319
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,386
-Oh, no.
-All of them?

320
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,056
You didn't know?
It's a well-known tragedy.

321
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,602
Anyway, even the West German
police failed like that.

322
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,896
So the Korean police and ANSP…

323
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:03,900
We should never count on them.

324
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,282
For now,

325
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:12,742
those bastards…

326
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:14,494
We should

327
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:18,373
do as those bastards say
if we want to stay alive.

328
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:20,542
God, you idiot!

329
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,170
-You stupid…
-What?

330
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,504
You idiot.

331
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,673
You little…

332
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:30,635
Keep quiet!

333
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:35,182
How will you handle
the consequences of the failed mission?

334
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,519
I'm the leader.
I'll take full responsibility.

335
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,813
You did nothing wrong.

336
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:44,399
I'll go back alive at all cost
and take responsibility.

337
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:45,525
Responsibility?

338
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:50,822
You're a coward begging for your life
even after being fooled twice.

339
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:53,325
How will you do that?

340
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:04,502
Comrade Joo.

341
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:11,134
Don't forget the party
ordered you to obey my orders.

342
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,817
You think the party trusts you,
but you're mistaken.

343
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:32,864
If I sense any change
in your ideology, I can--

344
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:16,366
Why did you disobey my orders
and follow me into Mount Ogong?

345
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:22,455
If you disobey my orders again,

346
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:24,749
then…

347
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:29,254
I won't shoot here.

348
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:34,175
I'll shoot here.

349
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,054
Your life depends on me, your leader.

350
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:41,474
Don't forget that.

351
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:56,239
Comrade Lim…

352
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,998
The rifle!

353
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,065
Ms. Oh?

354
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:38,823
Oh, no.

355
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:01,679
Bang!

356
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:05,934
Bang!

357
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,145
Bang!

358
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:10,605
Bang!

359
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:17,070
Bang!

360
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:20,573
My goodness. My arm hurts so much.

361
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,826
-Gosh.
-She's not herself right now.

362
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:24,786
The rifle is so heavy.

363
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:27,622
Stop it and come here.

364
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,794
Yes. All right. Just sit down.

365
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:33,711
Sit now.

366
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,557
Lim Soo-ho?

367
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:47,767
We have an injured person.

368
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:50,478
-Send a doctor in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

369
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,398
But how about you release
some of them in return?

370
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:56,276
You have too many hostages
for the three of you anyway.

371
00:39:58,236 --> 00:39:59,988
Send in a doctor in ten minutes.

372
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:01,739
We need more time.

373
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:05,618
We'll find a doctor as soon as possible,
so release some of them first.

374
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,078
You have 20 minutes.

375
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:11,082
<i>If a doctor doesn't come in here by 9:44,</i>

376
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,336
I'll execute
one hostage every ten minutes.

377
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:23,094
Hey, find a doctor right away.
We only got 20 minutes.

378
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:24,429
20 minutes?

379
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:27,098
Even our agency doctor
can't get here in 20 minutes.

380
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:28,266
What?

381
00:40:30,518 --> 00:40:31,769
I see.

382
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:37,525
Those damn bastards, are they trying
to train us like some freaking dog?

383
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:42,113
Why are you dilly-dallying when you can
just break in and wipe them out?

384
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:45,492
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

385
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,536
Kang Cheong-ya speaking.

386
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,704
Hey, where are you?

387
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:51,456
<i>What do you mean?</i>

388
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:52,957
You called me at the hospital.

389
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,251
That's good. Come
to the Hosu University dorm right now.

390
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:57,420
Yes. It'll take
less than ten minutes, right?

391
00:40:57,504 --> 00:40:58,963
<i>Why do you want me there?</i>

392
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:03,426
The spies' hostage situation?

393
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:07,555
<i>Come over here right now! To the scene!</i>

394
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:30,370
We'll escort you.

395
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,833
Open it!

396
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,962
-Hurry up!
-Open it!

397
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,427
<i>I'll disguise</i>

398
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:48,346
Han-na as a nurse, send her in,

399
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,891
and rescue your daughter first
no matter what.

400
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:56,062
But if we act rashly,
it'll put the hostages in more danger.

401
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:57,814
This is the perfect chance.

402
00:41:57,897 --> 00:42:01,401
If this drags on and they find out
she's your daughter, then it will…

403
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:04,821
I'm sorry to say this,

404
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:07,699
but something tragic might happen.

405
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:15,498
But Han-na wasn't very prudent yesterday.

406
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:17,542
Is she reliable?

407
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:21,421
Disguise myself as a nurse?

408
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:23,089
But they must know my face.

409
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:24,716
None of them knows your face.

410
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:26,593
They saw you briefly during the shoot-out.

411
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,139
I even spoke with them.

412
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:33,516
Do you remember
when I lost Han while tailing him?

413
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,184
I'm sure they set us up.

414
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:37,562
They must know my face.

415
00:42:38,146 --> 00:42:40,440
In any case, go in with the doctor

416
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:43,610
and rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

417
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:47,071
And how will I do that?

418
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:50,742
It might put the rest in more danger.
Don't you know that?

419
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:53,786
How am I supposed to pull off
the special op without equipment?

420
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:57,373
You're known for this kind of thing.

421
00:42:57,457 --> 00:42:59,876
You don't need any equipment.
Use your brain.

422
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:05,214
<i>Sweetie,</i>

423
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,925
you know how much I love you, right?

424
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:11,638
Cut to the chase. I came because
you said it was urgent. What is it?

425
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:15,350
Don't tell me
I have to treat those Northern spies.

426
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,275
There are three spies in there,
and two of them are injured.

427
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:25,777
Spies?

428
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,819
Forget it.

429
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:27,862
Wait.

430
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:30,073
If I take care of this well,

431
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:32,116
my party will support me in the future.

432
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,869
And it'll help me become president.

433
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:36,996
You said you wanted to see me become one.

434
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:39,582
If you, my beloved sweetie,

435
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:44,087
kill two of them with injections
pretending treating their wounds,

436
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,255
-then only one will be left.
-"Kill"?

437
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,885
Are you seriously
telling me to commit murder?

438
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,639
It's not murder. It's execution.

439
00:43:54,722 --> 00:43:58,017
There are 60 innocent college girls
being held in there.

440
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,228
By executing those spies,

441
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,731
you'll be saving the 60 innocent people.

442
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:11,072
You thought I'd be moved by such nonsense?

443
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:17,537
If I become president of this country,

444
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,206
I'll be able to abandon
my four-star father-in-law

445
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:22,500
and leave my dumb wife.

446
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:25,753
I doubt that.

447
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:29,173
My life wish is

448
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:33,761
to keep you by my side 24/7

449
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:35,096
for the rest of my life.

450
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,348
You know that.

451
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:42,854
Let's say I've taken care of the two.

452
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,356
What if the last one tries to kill me?

453
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,362
Do you really think I'd put you in danger
without any contingency plan?

454
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:53,656
Contingency plan?

455
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:57,785
<i>Soon, the whole building</i>

456
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:00,037
<i>will be wiretapped.</i>

457
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,790
<i>Once you take care of the two,</i>

458
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:05,543
<i>just say, "I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."</i>

459
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:09,130
<i>Once we hear you say that,
our forces will break in secretly</i>

460
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:11,299
<i>and kill the last one.</i>

461
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,929
But they're just three spies.

462
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:19,766
Do you have to pull this kind of trick?

463
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:25,104
What I want is simple.
I just want to break in and kill them all.

464
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,273
But…

465
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,320
it turned out Eun's daughter
is one of the hostages.

466
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:36,866
Mr. Eun's daughter?

467
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,163
I can't just do as I want
beside the anxious father.

468
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:44,749
So it came to this.

469
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:52,048
Even if you're asking, I'm a doctor.
I can't kill a person. No, I won't.

470
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:55,176
Please. Do this for me, honey.

471
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:56,552
-Please.
-Instead,

472
00:45:57,762 --> 00:45:59,889
I'll add sleep-inducing element
to the painkiller

473
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,474
and make them unconscious.

474
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:08,022
You wicked little fox.

475
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:10,525
Repeat the code phrase.

476
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,947
"I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."

477
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:17,448
Good.

478
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,579
Area 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5

479
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:25,665
are ready to be wiretapped.

480
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,169
Eun!

481
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:31,963
-Sir.
-Hurry up.

482
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:36,050
It's nice to meet you.

483
00:46:36,634 --> 00:46:37,635
You too.

484
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:39,554
Director Eun and Chief An.

485
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:44,809
As far as we know, two of the spies
and one agent of ours are injured.

486
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,646
Judging by the gunfire, some of
the students might've gotten hurt too.

487
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:51,190
Will you be okay by yourself?

488
00:46:51,816 --> 00:46:54,569
Dr. Kang's such an excellent doctor.

489
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:57,488
I noticed that one of the hostages
is a nursing major.

490
00:46:57,572 --> 00:46:59,198
She can have them help her.

491
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:02,034
I'll be okay by myself.

492
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:06,455
We'll do our best to get you out safely
once you're done.

493
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:11,794
And agent Jang Han-na
will assist you well.

494
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:44,994
This is the list of the captured students.

495
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,543
Does any of them have an illness?

496
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:54,545
Why?

497
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:57,089
Just tell me if there's anyone
who must get out.

498
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,807
Those with illnesses are hard to handle,

499
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:09,852
but there are other students
harder to control.

500
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,855
This one sleepwalks every night.

501
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:17,109
And this one fearlessly protests
while throwing petrol bombs.

502
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:21,656
And this one's a nut job who always does

503
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:23,991
what I tell her not to do.

504
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:36,128
Think about it.

505
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:38,714
They knew they'd be kicked out
if they broke the rules.

506
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:43,094
But they still deceived me
as well as ANSP agents…

507
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:46,639
They hid you inside the bench
in the sauna, didn't they?

508
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:48,724
Being all naked. Who does that?

509
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,686
They're so daring.

510
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:55,106
Yes, they're obedient for now,

511
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,150
but as time passes by,
they'll be hard to control.

512
00:48:58,234 --> 00:49:00,569
If you think the girls are easy to handle,

513
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:02,113
you'll get in trouble.

514
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:11,288
It doesn't have to be students, does it?

515
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:14,583
<i>I said, shut your mouths!</i>

516
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:17,795
I'm sorry.

517
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:36,939
I will keep my mouth shut.

518
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,357
Keep your heads down.

519
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:47,491
Everyone raise your heads.

520
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:01,005
I'll release some of you right now.

521
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:08,429
As for the rest of you, I'll release

522
00:50:09,096 --> 00:50:12,099
those who are cooperative
next time or the next time after that.

523
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:17,146
But for those who disobey us

524
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:19,732
and are uncooperative,

525
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:23,944
there will be no release.

526
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:27,198
I, Oh Gwang-tea, will always

527
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:29,867
be cooperative.

528
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,410
I swear.

529
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:36,415
If you understood, be wise about it.

530
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,182
If your name is called,

531
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:55,392
stand up.

532
00:51:05,486 --> 00:51:07,613
Mr. Eun, they're calling names.

533
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:15,287
Yeo Jeong-min.

534
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:20,835
<i>Ko Yu-na.</i>

535
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,169
Thank God!

536
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:26,799
-Shin Gyeong-ja.
-Here.

537
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:29,927
Ko Hye-ryeong.

538
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:33,973
I knew it!
I knew this wouldn't be the end of me.

539
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:41,730
Seo Eun-gyo.

540
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:43,607
Thank you!

541
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:44,608
Kim Ye-won.

542
00:51:46,026 --> 00:51:47,403
<i>-Park Seon-ja.
-Here.</i>

543
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:48,946
<i>Kang Tae-ji.</i>

544
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,115
Yoon Seol-hui.

545
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:55,202
Thank you!

546
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:58,372
Three from room 207?

547
00:51:58,956 --> 00:52:00,291
It's suspicious.

548
00:52:00,374 --> 00:52:01,333
You're right.

549
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:02,751
It must be because of Yeong-ro.

550
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:05,588
What's this? Yeong-ro's roommates
are being treated specially?

551
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:07,506
This is so unfair.

552
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,092
Tell me about it. It's so obvious.

553
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:12,469
-That can't be.
-It's possible.

554
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:13,721
Of course it is.

555
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,058
Quiet!

556
00:52:20,895 --> 00:52:23,397
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:27,276
Can I tell you about myself a bit?

558
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:30,029
I, Oh Gwang-tae, grew up

559
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,990
with a single mom,
and like that wasn't enough,

560
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,161
I've gotten hepatitis A.

561
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,454
If I stay here--

562
00:52:38,537 --> 00:52:40,372
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:42,416
We'll never release you.

564
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,793
But I'm telling the truth.

565
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:47,463
-I really have it. I swear.
-Stop.

566
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:48,839
Forget what I said.

567
00:52:49,423 --> 00:52:50,633
You're such a loser.

568
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:57,473
Eun Yeong-ro.

569
00:53:03,187 --> 00:53:04,355
That's it.

570
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:07,358
Eun Yeong-ro?

571
00:53:14,073 --> 00:53:15,199
Eun Yeong-ro.

572
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:22,081
You can't do this.

573
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,917
Be quiet, Bun-ok.

574
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,252
You didn't ever hear us out.

575
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,337
Why are you only releasing students?

576
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:32,341
What about me, Mr. Kim, and Ms. Oh?
We can't even get a chance?

577
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:34,385
This is unfair!

578
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:37,554
On what grounds did you decide on this?

579
00:53:38,764 --> 00:53:40,516
On what grounds!

580
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:41,767
Shut your mouth!

581
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,186
She's so feisty.

582
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:48,482
This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?

583
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:51,860
She can't die and I can?

584
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:08,544
She's right.

585
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,047
Bun-ok is right.

586
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:15,009
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

587
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:18,345
<i>Release someone else.</i>

588
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:22,766
How can I leave when they can't?

589
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:25,686
That's not right.

590
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:31,692
I'll stay too.

591
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:35,738
I played a big part too.

592
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:37,614
If Yeong-ro stays,

593
00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:40,451
I can't just leave her here
to save my skin.

594
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:44,788
Why don't we just draw lots?
That'll be fair.

595
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:51,795
I totally agree!

596
00:54:51,879 --> 00:54:53,714
-I agree.
-So do I.

597
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:06,977
Shut up! Quiet!

598
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:23,285
RÉSUMÉ
KYE BUN-OK

599
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:29,333
She's our telephone operator.

600
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,169
She's looking after her sick parents.

601
00:55:32,753 --> 00:55:35,798
She's a poor girl
who's the sole breadwinner.

602
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:39,301
I really hope you'll release her.

603
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,721
You were the last one.

604
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:50,521
But not anymore.

605
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,624
You'll never get a chance to be released.

606
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:24,805
When I said those who disobey us
and are uncooperative

607
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:28,308
wouldn't be released,
you should've taken it seriously.

608
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,147
Drawing lots?

609
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,193
I decide who gets released.

610
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:45,868
Hold on. Wait!

611
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:54,126
In any case, we're being released, right?

612
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,470
Hey!

613
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:15,022
Because of that stupid Gizzard…

614
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:19,735
What a wench!

615
00:58:00,317 --> 00:58:01,902
AREA 2-1
WIRETAPPED

616
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,035
Mr. An.

617
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:16,291
Gang-mu must be locked up
and sending us a message.

618
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:24,841
It seems
the hostages are locked in the cafeteria

619
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:29,012
and Gang-mu is
locked in room 203 separately.

620
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:33,350
I think he's tied up in a separate room.

621
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:37,729
According to the blueprint, the distance
between the cafeteria and the room

622
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,524
is about 30 meters and…

623
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:49,366
I have a favor to ask.

624
00:58:50,742 --> 00:58:52,619
Of course, you don't have to do it

625
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,415
because if we get caught,
you'll be put in danger too.

626
00:58:57,165 --> 00:59:00,419
If that's the case,
let me hear you out first.

627
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:05,591
This.

628
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:08,927
I want to give this to Mr. Lee.

629
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:12,889
How about we hide it in the medical kit?

630
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:16,518
They know who I am,
so it's impossible for me to bring it.

631
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:24,568
-Is the doctor ready?
<i>-Before that,</i>

632
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:27,279
I need to check if the students are safe.

633
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:28,822
What are you trying to pull again?

634
00:59:28,905 --> 00:59:30,657
To check if they're safe

635
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,743
and to protect the doctor,

636
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:34,828
one of our agents will accompany her.

637
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:37,122
And please let the doctor
treat our agent too.

638
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:38,540
Look.

639
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,587
I can't guarantee what will happen
if they try anything else.

640
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:47,799
I give you my word.

641
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:08,654
Jang.

642
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:09,738
Yes, sir.

643
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:13,909
They promised to let Gang-mu be treated.

644
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:16,453
So check if the students are okay first.

645
01:00:16,536 --> 01:00:17,704
Yes, sir.

646
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:12,736
Stop there.

647
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:18,408
Put down the bag.

648
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,465
Open it.

649
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:45,227
Now.

650
01:02:58,782 --> 01:02:59,908
Step back.

651
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:16,675
They're medical tools.

652
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:19,469
Please be careful not to contaminate them.

653
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:47,914
Go upstairs.

654
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,550
Go over it.

655
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:07,309
Just follow me.

656
01:04:22,365 --> 01:04:24,242
Where are the hostages?

657
01:04:35,879 --> 01:04:37,964
Gang-mu is with them, right?

658
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:39,382
Shut it.

659
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:42,636
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

660
01:04:46,932 --> 01:04:48,266
<i>And Gang-mu is</i>

661
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,769
locked in room 203 separately.

662
01:04:54,898 --> 01:04:55,732
To your left.

663
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:19,464
Comrade Lim.

664
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:52,038
Move faster.

665
01:06:05,176 --> 01:06:07,887
Comrade Joo, get the doctor here first.

666
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:12,976
I need someone to assist me.

667
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,895
I heard there's a nursing major here.

668
01:06:17,605 --> 01:06:19,274
Kim Dong-ji.

669
01:06:19,357 --> 01:06:20,525
Yes, ma'am.

670
01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:23,528
She's the one.

671
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:26,906
Can you help me?

672
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,581
He's been running a fever since dawn.

673
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,474
If he's over 38°C, he can't have surgery.

674
01:06:52,557 --> 01:06:54,642
I must give him
a fever reducer and antibiotics

675
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:56,394
to reduce the fever first.

676
01:07:00,482 --> 01:07:02,233
I heard two of you are injured.

677
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:04,069
Where's the other one?

678
01:07:06,237 --> 01:07:07,489
Comrade Joo.

679
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,126
Get treated.

680
01:07:48,363 --> 01:07:52,117
Hello, sir. This is
Hong Ae-ra. You remember me, right?

681
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,369
I called to ask you something.

682
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:59,457
You told me the other day
that for my husband to become president,

683
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:02,836
13 young virgins must
be offered as sacrifices, right?

684
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:11,094
But does it have to be exactly 13 people?

685
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,016
Oh, I see.

686
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:21,646
Thank you. I'll come visit you soon.

687
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:28,820
Ma'am, it's all ready.

688
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:45,461
I can see all of the 64 hostages are safe.

689
01:08:45,545 --> 01:08:47,589
How many of them will you release?

690
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:55,180
Rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

691
01:08:57,098 --> 01:09:00,018
The doctor needs to treat them anyway,

692
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:03,855
so why don't you just release them too?

693
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:10,778
I think that'll be better for both of us.

694
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:16,409
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

695
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,036
Here!

696
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:19,204
What's going on?

697
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:21,915
Hey, Ms. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong?

698
01:09:21,998 --> 01:09:23,208
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

699
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:24,709
Hold on.

700
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:27,170
Drink water.

701
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:30,298
What's wrong?
Do you have trouble breathing?

702
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:31,382
Attention.

703
01:09:34,052 --> 01:09:36,596
I'll select people who will be released.

704
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:46,648
<i>If you disobey me this time again,</i>

705
01:09:48,024 --> 01:09:49,567
you won't get out of here alive.

706
01:09:58,243 --> 01:09:59,285
You.

707
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:04,791
You.

708
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,835
<i>You.</i>

709
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:10,463
<i>You.</i>

710
01:10:10,546 --> 01:10:12,340
"You"? Damn it.

711
01:10:12,423 --> 01:10:15,009
Why isn't this bastard
calling their names?

712
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:17,387
Who is he picking?

713
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,973
Don't you think we need to find it out?

714
01:10:21,307 --> 01:10:24,310
Damn it. My blood pressure.

715
01:10:25,061 --> 01:10:26,354
The six of you will get out too.

716
01:10:35,321 --> 01:10:36,990
God damn bastard.

717
01:10:37,073 --> 01:10:39,242
Everyone I selected, come out.

718
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,043
Yu-na.

719
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:50,712
What's wrong, Yu-na?

720
01:10:50,795 --> 01:10:53,256
-He's having trouble breathing.
-What's wrong?

721
01:10:53,339 --> 01:10:55,925
-Are you okay?
-Yu-na.

722
01:10:56,843 --> 01:10:59,262
-Go get a plastic bag. Now!
-I'll go.

723
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:04,267
Yu-na, you're okay.

724
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,978
You won't die. Everything will be okay.

725
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:08,688
Have her breathe into it. Hurry.

726
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:11,858
Breathe. Breathe deeply.

727
01:11:13,276 --> 01:11:15,611
Deeply and slowly.

728
01:11:18,364 --> 01:11:21,659
I'm so scared.

729
01:11:23,286 --> 01:11:25,705
I think the stress is too much for her.

730
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:29,000
Can't you release her too?

731
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:31,044
Me too!

732
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:32,962
-I can't stand it any longer!
-Me too!

733
01:11:33,046 --> 01:11:35,673
-Me too!
-Me too!

734
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:36,883
-Me too!
-Me too!

735
01:11:36,966 --> 01:11:39,344
-Me too!
-It should be us!

736
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:41,304
-This is a women's dorm!
-Me too!

737
01:11:41,387 --> 01:11:43,306
-Why do I have to keep quiet?
-Me too!

738
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:46,726
-Listen to what we have to say too!
-Me too!

739
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,854
-Let us men go too!
-Me too!

740
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,481
-God damn it!
-Me too!

741
01:11:51,814 --> 01:11:53,775
-Why do we have to be here?
-Me too!

742
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:55,109
Enough!

743
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,030
Who wants to die first?

744
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:00,698
Who?

745
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:01,824
Stop!

746
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:25,515
Who are you to decide who gets to live?

747
01:12:28,851 --> 01:12:30,561
<i>Only I will be enough.</i>

748
01:12:33,272 --> 01:12:34,774
<i>I'll stay, so release all of them.</i>

749
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:36,567
Let them all go!

750
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:48,746
Keep your heads down!

751
01:12:53,376 --> 01:12:55,420
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

752
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,926
You leave.

753
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:07,265
This is our dorm.

754
01:13:08,349 --> 01:13:10,309
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

755
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:14,313
Oh, my goodness.

756
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:18,484
-You're not done.
-Let go.

757
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:20,236
I'll kill this damn wench.

758
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:52,852
Please let them go. They're innocent.

759
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:15,750
You…

760
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:19,629
You don't know who I am, do you?

761
01:14:35,478 --> 01:14:36,854
I'll tell you.

762
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:43,069
I'm…

763
01:14:45,738 --> 01:14:47,490
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

764
01:14:56,749 --> 01:14:58,417
Eun Chang-su,

765
01:14:58,918 --> 01:15:01,254
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

766
01:15:03,256 --> 01:15:05,091
is my father.

767
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:41,043
She hid him? Hid the communist spy?
Your daughter really did it?

768
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:44,755
<i>Does hiding a spy count as espionage?</i>

769
01:15:47,091 --> 01:15:49,260
<i>You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?</i>

770
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:53,264
You son of a b****!

771
01:15:53,347 --> 01:15:55,725
<i>I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.</i>

772
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:57,393
What kind of deal did you make?

773
01:15:57,476 --> 01:16:00,479
<i>We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.</i>

774
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:02,732
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars?

775
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:06,485
<i>I'm sure our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.</i>

776
01:16:07,486 --> 01:16:08,571
Kill them.

777
01:16:08,654 --> 01:16:12,325
Director Eun Chang-su won't
even find his daughter's body.

778
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:14,577
Please.

779
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:16,245
Kill me.

BONUS

782
01:16:33,262 --> 01:16:36,932
-One, two.
-Careful.

783
01:16:37,016 --> 01:16:39,268
We must take them down
before they blow themselves up!

784
01:16:39,352 --> 01:16:42,563
What if we break in rashly
and get the hostages killed, you bastard?

785
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:43,939
What? "Bastard"?

786
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:45,316
How dare you call me that?

787
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:48,653
Just get lost. This is my jurisdiction!

788
01:16:48,736 --> 01:16:51,030
You always dilly-dally and are indecisive,

789
01:16:51,113 --> 01:16:54,367
and that's why all this has happened.
You're a liability to us!

790
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:58,287
You always blame others,
and that's why this is happening!

791
01:16:58,621 --> 01:17:00,373
Whose fault is this?

792
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:03,334
A soft boy like you can
never serve the country well.

793
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:06,253
You killed your former superior
on the pretext of serving the country.

794
01:17:06,337 --> 01:17:07,880
Do you call that serving the country?

795
01:17:07,963 --> 01:17:10,966
What do you know about revolution?

796
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,678
Just discipline your son better.

797
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,764
You piece of s***, how dare you talk
about my son with your dirty mouth?

798
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:21,686
What did you say? Do you want to die?
I must've gone too easy on you!

799
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:23,396
<i>What? "Gone easy on me"?</i>

800
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:25,564
<i>-You God damn bastard!
-Let go, you s***!</i>

801
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:26,649
<i>I'll just--</i>

802
01:17:26,732 --> 01:17:28,693
<i>-Get lost already!
-God damn it!</i>
