01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.126 line:85.83%,end
Get treated.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.117 line:85.83%,end
Hello, sir. This is
Hong Ae-ra. You remember me, right?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.369 line:85.83%,end
I called to ask you something.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.457 line:85.83%,end
You told me the other day
that for my husband to become president,

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.836 line:85.83%,end
13 young virgins must
be offered as sacrifices, right?

01:08:55.214 --> 01:09:00.094 line:85.83%,end
But does it have to be exactly 13 people?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.016 line:85.83%,end
Oh, I see.

01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:10.646 line:85.83%,end
Thank you. I'll come visit you soon.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.820 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, it's all ready.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.461 line:85.83%,end
I can see all of the 64 hostages are safe.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:36.589 line:85.83%,end
How many of them will you release?

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:44.180 line:85.83%,end
Rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:49.018 line:85.83%,end
The doctor needs to treat them anyway,

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:52.855 line:85.83%,end
so why don't you just release them too?

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.778 line:85.83%,end
I think that'll be better for both of us.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:05.409 line:85.83%,end
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.036 line:85.83%,end
Here!

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:08.204 line:85.83%,end
What's going on?

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.915 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Ms. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong?

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:12.208 line:85.83%,end
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:13.709 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:16.170 line:85.83%,end
Drink water.

01:10:16.837 --> 01:10:19.298 line:85.83%,end
What's wrong?
Do you have trouble breathing?

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.382 line:85.83%,end
Attention.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.596 line:85.83%,end
I'll select people who will be released.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.648 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you disobey me this time again,</i>

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.567 line:85.83%,end
you won't get out of here alive.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.285 line:85.83%,end
You.

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:53.791 line:85.83%,end
You.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.835 line:85.83%,end
<i>You.</i>

01:10:58.212 --> 01:10:59.463 line:85.83%,end
<i>You.</i>

01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:01.340 line:85.83%,end
"You"? Damn it.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:04.009 line:85.83%,end
Why isn't this bastard
calling their names?

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.387 line:85.83%,end
Who is he picking?

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.973 line:85.83%,end
Don't you think we need to find it out?

01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:13.310 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. My blood pressure.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.354 line:85.83%,end
The six of you will get out too.

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:25.990 line:85.83%,end
God damn bastard.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:28.242 line:85.83%,end
Everyone I selected, come out.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.043 line:85.83%,end
Yu-na.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.712 line:85.83%,end
What's wrong, Yu-na?

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.256 line:85.83%,end
-He's having trouble breathing.
-What's wrong?

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:44.925 line:85.83%,end
-Are you okay?
-Yu-na.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.262 line:85.83%,end
-Go get a plastic bag. Now!
-I'll go.

01:11:51.348 --> 01:11:53.267 line:85.83%,end
Yu-na, you're okay.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.978 line:85.83%,end
You won't die. Everything will be okay.

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:57.688 line:85.83%,end
Have her breathe into it. Hurry.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.858 line:85.83%,end
Breathe. Breathe deeply.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.611 line:85.83%,end
Deeply and slowly.

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:10.659 line:85.83%,end
I'm so scared.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.705 line:85.83%,end
I think the stress is too much for her.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.000 line:85.83%,end
Can't you release her too?

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.044 line:85.83%,end
Me too!

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.962 line:85.83%,end
-I can't stand it any longer!
-Me too!

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.673 line:85.83%,end
-Me too!
-Me too!

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:25.883 line:85.83%,end
-Me too!
-Me too!

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:28.344 line:85.83%,end
-Me too!
-It should be us!

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.304 line:85.83%,end
-This is a women's dorm!
-Me too!

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:32.306 line:85.83%,end
-Why do I have to keep quiet?
-Me too!

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:35.726 line:85.83%,end
-Listen to what we have to say too!
-Me too!

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.854 line:85.83%,end
-Let us men go too!
-Me too!

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.481 line:85.83%,end
-God damn it!
-Me too!

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:42.775 line:85.83%,end
-Why do we have to be here?
-Me too!

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.109 line:85.83%,end
Enough!

01:12:46.278 --> 01:12:48.030 line:85.83%,end
Who wants to die first?

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:49.698 line:85.83%,end
Who?

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:50.824 line:85.83%,end
Stop!
