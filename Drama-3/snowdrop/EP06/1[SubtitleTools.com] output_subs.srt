EPISODE 6

3
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:28,868
Now…

4
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:31,746
Plan B is the only option now.

5
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,248
And in order for it to succeed,

6
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,335
we must kill them all.

7
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,049
As soon as they come out,

8
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:45,676
-kill them all.
-Mr. Nam,

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
even if we go with plan B, if we kill
them, the North won't sit back--

10
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:50,598
What if they won't?

11
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:52,975
We made a deal--

12
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,153
You think they'll disclose
that we made a deal?

13
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:06,656
We have no choice but
to exaggerate the engagement.

14
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,659
If the North throws a monkey wrench
into the works, it'll fail!

15
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:12,286
You think they're that stupid?

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,289
You think they'll refuse the chance
to make huge money every election?

17
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:18,584
But if it fails,
the hostages' lives will be in danger!

18
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:19,669
God damn it!

19
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,297
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

20
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,842
Everyone, retreat.

21
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:44,652
This is HQ. Ambush team,
we're going in for the kill.

22
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:46,654
Once the targets are in the zone,

23
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,197
kill them at all costs.

24
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:33,534
The targets appeared. All units,
they're approaching the kill zone.

25
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:34,702
Stand by.

26
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,961
Let's go.

27
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,383
Stop.

28
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:07,735
Three targets, armed with AK-47s.

29
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,977
A change of plan. Open fire.

30
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,858
Eung-cheol!

31
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,252
Everyone, calm down.

32
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:09,714
I think they're trying to escape
through the exit in basement two.

33
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,341
And I'll go after them right now.

34
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,302
So everyone stay here.

35
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:18,347
Let's go.

36
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,203
Eung-cheol, hold me.

37
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:58,679
You bastards!

38
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,432
It's a grenade! Get down!

39
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,438
All units, fire!

40
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,782
Get out of here! Hurry up!

41
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,046
Four of our guys are injured.

42
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,298
It looks like the plan failed.

43
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,262
I'll kill them all.

44
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,283
Eung-cheol!

45
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,618
Get it together.

46
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,404
<i>We're going in.
We'll go in and secure the targets.</i>

47
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:39,822
Hey, halt! Halt!

48
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,866
This is the director of ANSP. Halt!

49
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,543
If the students are killed,
we'll be doomed!

50
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:56,714
Why do you think
this happened in the first place?

51
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:59,175
Exaggerating the engagement won't help us!

52
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:02,052
Let's just go in and eliminate them all!

53
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:04,889
Are you insane?
What if all the hostages are killed?

54
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,349
I'll deal with the communist jerks,

55
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,768
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

56
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,062
SWAT team, listen--

57
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:15,149
If you stab them in the back twice,
how will you negotiate with them?

58
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:17,902
You think you can bury this
without anyone knowing?

59
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:29,807
You made sure
no one will talk about this, right?

60
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,477
If anyone asks about this
hostage situation, just lock them all up!

61
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,728
We already

62
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,065
took necessary measures just in case.

63
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,109
We told the shop owners

64
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,696
that we were catching deserters.
And we made sure

65
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,281
to keep the press quiet about it.

66
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,491
But your daughter…

67
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,001
Do you think the other hostages are okay?

68
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,795
Put me through to the dorm.

69
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,986
You bastard.

70
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:49,678
You son of a b****!

71
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,192
You murderer.

72
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:06,945
You bastard!

73
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,534
How dare you kill my husband?

74
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:24,380
Who gave you the right to kill him?

75
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,346
You murderer!

76
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,140
How dare you!

77
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:39,353
Bring her here.

78
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,898
You're all right. Calm down.

79
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:29,862
Twice.

80
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,448
They deceived us twice!

81
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,368
You wasted our precious bullets.

82
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:40,038
It's always an emotional prick
like you that ruins a mission.

83
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,460
You need to be coolheaded
in a situation like this.

84
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,255
If you keep this up,
I won't need you anymore.

85
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,264
Everyone go back to the cafeteria.

86
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,894
Now!

87
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:17,409
I'll watch the cafeteria.
You go bring Eung-cheol.

88
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,537
And lock him in another room.

89
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:24,166
You two.

90
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:26,960
Follow me.

91
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:32,674
Yes, sir!

92
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,609
Yes.

93
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,320
Sir.

94
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:54,822
It's the military situation room.

95
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:07,042
Hey, have you looked into the casualties?

96
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,294
Ask about Han I-seop first.

97
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:12,631
Yes, sir!
All of the armed spies were killed.

98
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:17,636
And Professor Han who was with them
was killed by one of the Northern spies.

99
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,679
Is he dead?

100
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,266
How about our casualties?

101
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:25,769
One killed in action
and four injured, sir.

102
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:28,814
Yeong-u!

103
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:31,233
Yeong-u, stay with me!

104
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:35,279
You'll be okay. Hang in there.

105
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,001
Don't tell their families just yet.

106
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,628
And ask the press for a news embargo.

107
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:57,134
Here. We need help here.

108
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,430
Chief An.

109
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:04,308
Tell the press that Han I-seop died
while defecting to the North.

110
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,727
-Defecting to the North?
-Yes.

111
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,313
<i>But he was the
opposition party's mentor in economics.</i>

112
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:10,480
An.

113
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,442
Just tell them the North abducted him
and we tried to rescue him.

114
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,403
Inspiring the people's sense
of national security will help us--

115
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,282
You want to stop there
when we can win the game?

116
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:23,744
If the opposition party raises an issue,
we will be counterattacked.

117
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,339
Counterattack?

118
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:40,302
Making up evidence with a dead guy is
just a piece of cake. What counterattack?

119
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:44,890
Will the higher-ups be content with
inspiring a sense of national security?

120
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,439
Do it.

121
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,442
I'll tell them right now
he was trying to defect to the North.

122
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,236
<i>Of course, he'd kill them.</i>

123
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,405
<i>You know how people are willing</i>

124
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,199
to kill their own family,

125
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:05,452
cousins, and even children
if it helps them become king.

126
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,287
So why would he be any different?

127
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:12,334
Come on. You know how much
Ms. Hong care for his daughter.

128
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,587
Your own child means

129
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:17,798
more than anything in the world.

130
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,845
I feel like a horrible person.

131
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,390
As soon as I heard
about the hostage situation,

132
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,725
the first thing I thought of
is the fortuneteller.

133
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,938
She's not even your own daughter.

134
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:36,108
I must say,
you're such an angel, Ms. Hong.

135
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,736
Are you

136
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:43,323
very worried that 13 people will die

137
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,409
in the dorm?

138
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:48,286
What?

139
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,249
That must be why
you ran over here so late at night.

140
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,251
I ran over here

141
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,336
so late at night?

142
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,133
They say you can never hide
your humble origins.

143
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:02,718
How could you be so rude?

144
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:06,555
Don't you know my husband is
your husband's superior?

145
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:07,973
Charlotte.

146
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:11,768
You know that my husband graduated
from the military academy

147
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,228
four years earlier than him?

148
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:15,355
Pardon?

149
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:19,609
Well, yes. That's…

150
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:23,405
Yes, I'm aware of that.

151
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:27,534
They say the boughs that bear the most
hang the lowest.

152
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,829
I know the higher-up likes your husband,

153
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:33,373
but he might end up paying dearly

154
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,377
for disrespecting his senior.
I'm quite worried.

155
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,422
Worried?

156
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,799
You're worried?

157
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,801
You wench!

158
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,804
How dare a lowly entertainer like you
threaten me?

159
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm a daughter of a general.
A four-star general!

160
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,438
My goodness. Ma'am, please calm down.

161
00:16:57,105 --> 00:17:01,151
Hey, your husband rose
from humble origins.

162
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:05,405
Mine has many high-ranking in-laws.
You think they're on the same level?

163
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,451
Your husband becoming president.

164
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,703
Don't even dream about it.

165
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:15,123
It's not something
a lowlife like you can covet!

166
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:26,176
Ms. Hong, I'll get going too.

167
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:47,572
<i>He definitely ordered us
to cooperate with the South.</i>

168
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:53,954
<i>Father must've made a deal with
the director of ANSP to save our lives.</i>

169
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,006
<i>Then why did they…</i>

170
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,760
<i>try to kill us?</i>

171
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:37,372
I laid Comrade Lee down
in the next room. He's severely injured.

172
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,040
I'll go to him with the first aid kit.

173
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,172
You.

174
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:52,804
Follow me with the first aid kit.

175
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,776
-Why is he taking her?
-I don't know.

176
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,904
Keep your heads down.

177
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:17,704
Eung-cheol.

178
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,458
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:33,094
Wait.

180
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,187
I said, wait.

181
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:54,658
I'm okay, sir.

182
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:56,660
No, you're not, you punk.

183
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:23,853
Fortunately,
you didn't hurt any arteries or veins.

184
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:27,232
I could even take
an axe blade with my abs.

185
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,901
So this wound is nothing.

186
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:31,903
I can survive this.

187
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,165
It should be treated.

188
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:50,315
Let everyone go.

189
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,869
If you feel bad for me just a little bit,

190
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,873
let them go. Please.

191
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,131
Let them go.

192
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:31,022
Tomorrow morning, I'll demand a doctor
who will treat Eung-cheol's wound.

193
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,442
They'll demand the release of a hostage.

194
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,070
And I'm…

195
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:41,533
planning to release you.

196
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:47,664
To repay you for what you've done
for me these past few days.

197
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,584
We'll be even then.

198
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,007
"Even"?

199
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,352
Go back to the cafeteria.

200
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,214
Look at her.

201
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,425
Her hand is bandaged.

202
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,470
-What? Bandage?
-She's right.

203
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:44,888
He treated her?

204
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:47,098
But why treat only her?

205
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:38,483
Lim Soo-ho?

206
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,110
Are you guys okay?

207
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:43,738
I'll speak to the person in charge.

208
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:47,492
There are people who don't agree with me,
so it went awry.

209
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,078
<i>But I'm still willing to get you out</i>

210
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,704
safely and--

211
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:54,832
I'll talk to the person
who ordered to kill us.

212
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,544
I'm the person in charge here.
I'm the director of ANSP.

213
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,551
So you're the one
who ordered to kill us, you bastard?

214
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,302
What? "Bastard"?

215
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:08,888
How dare this communist call you that?

216
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:12,183
Give it. I'll teach him a lesson. Give it!

217
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,102
Stop it, you idiot!

218
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:20,942
Don't deal with him. Why don't you
go home? I'll take care of this.

219
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:22,652
You'll take care of this?

220
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:23,903
Why don't you go home?

221
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:26,698
You're not coolheaded,
desperate to save your child.

222
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:27,615
You little…

223
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:31,786
Are you trying to get her killed?

224
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,081
If they find out,
what do you think they'll do?

225
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:43,172
What're you looking at?

226
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:52,724
There was an engagement on the West Sea
at around 22:00.

227
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,560
An engagement?

228
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:59,272
<i>The ship for the North was
stupid enough to be get caught.</i>

229
00:25:59,772 --> 00:26:04,277
The navy found the ship,
so there was nothing I could do.

230
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:07,030
And my colleagues?

231
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:07,947
<i>Before that…</i>

232
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,075
I heard gunfire. Are the students okay?

233
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:18,124
If you wanted them safe,
you shouldn't have deceived us twice.

234
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:23,129
What happened to my colleagues?

235
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:25,465
Unfortunately,

236
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:29,093
everyone was killed
including Professor Han.

237
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:31,721
Everyone?

238
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,683
How can I believe you?

239
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,226
Whether or not you believe me,

240
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:40,521
I want to help you.

241
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:43,566
<i>Give me a bit more time,
and I'll come up with a plan--</i>

242
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,109
When you tried to kill us,

243
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:51,074
had the North approved it?

244
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:53,534
Of course not. We had no time for that.

245
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,246
Remember this.

246
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,877
Once we're convinced we're never
going back alive, we'll blow ourselves up.

247
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,005
And all the hostages will die too.

248
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:30,238
<i>You must accomplish
this mission at all costs, okay?</i>

249
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,534
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

250
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,786
<i>are pointing a gun at me.</i>

251
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:41,207
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

252
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,542
Don't forget that.

253
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:58,891
Mom…

254
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:59,155
PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR KIM IL SUNG,
DEAR LEADER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE

255
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,951
Because your son failed the mission,

256
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,287
we lost 300 million dollars.

257
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,205
The party's 300 million dollars.

258
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:11,792
Have you forgotten our Leader
ordered us to get it done at all costs?

259
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:14,587
It's too early

260
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:17,506
to say the mission has failed.

261
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:20,760
Too early?

262
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:24,138
You think your son,
who's holding people hostage

263
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:25,765
in the middle of Seoul,

264
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,143
will come back with 300 million dollars?

265
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:35,191
The party will make a decision soon.
Prepare yourself.

266
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:45,201
We failed our mission,
so there's only one option left for us.

267
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,080
To kill them all

268
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,625
and blow ourselves up.

269
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:58,923
It's too early for that. We must try
our best to go back alive until the end.

270
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,217
I'll buy as much time as--

271
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,095
We shouldn't beg them for negotiation.
Blowing ourselves up…

272
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,433
is the only way
to defend the honor of our Leader.

273
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:17,108
We'll be dying for nothing.

274
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:19,902
Dying for nothing?

275
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:32,999
You son of a b****.

276
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,668
You dare to call it dying for nothing?

277
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:40,548
To shoot all the hostages dead

278
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:43,300
and blow ourselves up in a determined way

279
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:45,886
is the most honorable death for us!

280
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:50,433
I'll decide if we must die or not.

281
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:52,727
I'm your leader.

282
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,439
You're just a soft guy
from a powerful family. How dare you

283
00:32:56,522 --> 00:32:58,024
disrespect the revolutionary spirit?

284
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:02,028
It would've gone smoothly
if you hadn't come to the dorm!

285
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,622
Hey, Yeong-ro. Do something.

286
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:16,000
You and he must be close.

287
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,710
Do something for us!

288
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:19,462
What could she do?

289
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:22,673
we were also fooled.
She didn't know he was a spy either.

290
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:23,799
She didn't?

291
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:26,135
Look what she got us into.
"I didn't know" won't cut it.

292
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:28,971
You guys from room 207
are accomplices. So be quiet.

293
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:32,683
Accomplices?
Look, I'm also mad at Yeong-ro.

294
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:35,186
I told you we shouldn't have hid him!

295
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:42,234
But it is true that we really thought
he was a college student we met on a date.

296
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,528
And you met him with us.

297
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:48,407
She's right.
And he was your partner that day.

298
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:49,825
-Partner?
-Bun-ok's partner?

299
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:51,077
She joined them?

300
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:53,788
So you think you did nothing wrong?

301
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:55,414
Stop arguing!

302
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:57,291
The ANSP agent was just dragged out.

303
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,044
We must find a way to get out alive.

304
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:01,420
Why take it out on me?

305
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:04,215
You think we can find any way
in this situation?

306
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,885
Byeong-tae!

307
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:09,428
Do something.

308
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:12,765
You'll be commissioned soon.
Will you just sit back?

309
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:15,810
Isn't there any manual
for a situation like this?

310
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:17,895
Actually…

311
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:23,192
There's nothing in particular.

312
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:27,822
But…

313
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:33,410
With my great leadership

314
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,413
and sense of duty to save your lives,
let me tell you something.

315
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:40,417
In 1972, there was a hostage situation
during the Munich Olympics.

316
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:44,296
And the West German police
dealt with it in such an idiotic way,

317
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,506
so all the hostages

318
00:34:46,006 --> 00:34:47,299
were killed.

319
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,386
-Oh, no.
-All of them?

320
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,056
You didn't know?
It's a well-known tragedy.

321
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,602
Anyway, even the West German
police failed like that.

322
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:00,896
So the Korean police and ANSP…

323
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:04,900
We should never count on them.

324
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,282
For now,

325
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:13,742
those bastards…

326
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:15,494
We should

327
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:19,373
do as those bastards say
if we want to stay alive.

328
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:21,542
God, you idiot!

329
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:24,170
-You stupid…
-What?

330
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,504
You idiot.

331
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:27,673
You little…

332
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:31,635
Keep quiet!

333
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:36,182
How will you handle
the consequences of the failed mission?

334
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,519
I'm the leader.
I'll take full responsibility.

335
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,813
You did nothing wrong.

336
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,399
I'll go back alive at all cost
and take responsibility.

337
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:46,525
Responsibility?

338
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:51,822
You're a coward begging for your life
even after being fooled twice.

339
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:54,325
How will you do that?

340
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:05,502
Comrade Joo.

341
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:12,134
Don't forget the party
ordered you to obey my orders.

342
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:28,817
You think the party trusts you,
but you're mistaken.

343
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:33,864
If I sense any change
in your ideology, I can--

344
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:17,366
Why did you disobey my orders
and follow me into Mount Ogong?

345
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:23,455
If you disobey my orders again,

346
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:25,749
then…

347
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,254
I won't shoot here.

348
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:35,175
I'll shoot here.

349
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:39,054
Your life depends on me, your leader.

350
00:37:41,098 --> 00:37:42,474
Don't forget that.

351
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:57,239
Comrade Lim…

352
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,998
The rifle!

353
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,065
Ms. Oh?

354
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:39,823
Oh, no.

355
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,679
Bang!

356
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:06,934
Bang!

357
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,145
Bang!

358
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:11,605
Bang!

359
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:18,070
Bang!

360
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:21,573
My goodness. My arm hurts so much.

361
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:23,826
-Gosh.
-She's not herself right now.

362
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:25,786
The rifle is so heavy.

363
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:28,622
Stop it and come here.

364
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:33,794
Yes. All right. Just sit down.

365
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:34,711
Sit now.

366
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,557
Lim Soo-ho?

367
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:48,767
We have an injured person.

368
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:51,478
-Send a doctor in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

369
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,398
But how about you release
some of them in return?

370
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:57,276
You have too many hostages
for the three of you anyway.

371
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:00,988
Send in a doctor in ten minutes.

372
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,739
We need more time.

373
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:06,618
We'll find a doctor as soon as possible,
so release some of them first.

374
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,078
You have 20 minutes.

375
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:12,082
<i>If a doctor doesn't come in here by 9:44,</i>

376
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:16,336
I'll execute
one hostage every ten minutes.

377
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:24,094
Hey, find a doctor right away.
We only got 20 minutes.

378
00:40:24,178 --> 00:40:25,429
20 minutes?

379
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:28,098
Even our agency doctor
can't get here in 20 minutes.

380
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,266
What?

381
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:32,769
I see.

382
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:38,525
Those damn bastards, are they trying
to train us like some freaking dog?

383
00:40:39,151 --> 00:40:43,113
Why are you dilly-dallying when you can
just break in and wipe them out?

384
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,492
HANKUK CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

385
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,536
Kang Cheong-ya speaking.

386
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,704
Hey, where are you?

387
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,456
<i>What do you mean?</i>

388
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:53,957
You called me at the hospital.

389
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,251
That's good. Come
to the Hosu University dorm right now.

390
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:58,420
Yes. It'll take
less than ten minutes, right?

391
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,963
<i>Why do you want me there?</i>

392
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,426
The spies' hostage situation?

393
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:08,555
<i>Come over here right now! To the scene!</i>

394
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:31,370
We'll escort you.

395
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,833
Open it!

396
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,962
-Hurry up!
-Open it!

397
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:47,427
<i>I'll disguise</i>

398
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,346
Han-na as a nurse, send her in,

399
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:52,891
and rescue your daughter first
no matter what.

400
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:57,062
But if we act rashly,
it'll put the hostages in more danger.

401
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,814
This is the perfect chance.

402
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:02,401
If this drags on and they find out
she's your daughter, then it will…

403
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:05,821
I'm sorry to say this,

404
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:08,699
but something tragic might happen.

405
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:16,498
But Han-na wasn't very prudent yesterday.

406
00:42:17,624 --> 00:42:18,542
Is she reliable?

407
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:22,421
Disguise myself as a nurse?

408
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:24,089
But they must know my face.

409
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:25,716
None of them knows your face.

410
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:27,593
They saw you briefly during the shoot-out.

411
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,139
I even spoke with them.

412
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,516
Do you remember
when I lost Han while tailing him?

413
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,184
I'm sure they set us up.

414
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:38,562
They must know my face.

415
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:41,440
In any case, go in with the doctor

416
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:44,610
and rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

417
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:48,071
And how will I do that?

418
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:51,742
It might put the rest in more danger.
Don't you know that?

419
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:54,786
How am I supposed to pull off
the special op without equipment?

420
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:58,373
You're known for this kind of thing.

421
00:42:58,457 --> 00:43:00,876
You don't need any equipment.
Use your brain.

422
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:06,214
<i>Sweetie,</i>

423
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:08,925
you know how much I love you, right?

424
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,638
Cut to the chase. I came because
you said it was urgent. What is it?

425
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:16,350
Don't tell me
I have to treat those Northern spies.

426
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,275
There are three spies in there,
and two of them are injured.

427
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:26,777
Spies?

428
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,819
Forget it.

429
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:28,862
Wait.

430
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:31,073
If I take care of this well,

431
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,116
my party will support me in the future.

432
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,869
And it'll help me become president.

433
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:37,996
You said you wanted to see me become one.

434
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:40,582
If you, my beloved sweetie,

435
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:45,087
kill two of them with injections
pretending treating their wounds,

436
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,255
-then only one will be left.
-"Kill"?

437
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,885
Are you seriously
telling me to commit murder?

438
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:55,639
It's not murder. It's execution.

439
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:59,017
There are 60 innocent college girls
being held in there.

440
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,228
By executing those spies,

441
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:04,731
you'll be saving the 60 innocent people.

442
00:44:09,194 --> 00:44:12,072
You thought I'd be moved by such nonsense?

443
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:18,537
If I become president of this country,

444
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,206
I'll be able to abandon
my four-star father-in-law

445
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:23,500
and leave my dumb wife.

446
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:26,753
I doubt that.

447
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:30,173
My life wish is

448
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:34,761
to keep you by my side 24/7

449
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:36,096
for the rest of my life.

450
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:38,348
You know that.

451
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,854
Let's say I've taken care of the two.

452
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:46,356
What if the last one tries to kill me?

453
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:52,362
Do you really think I'd put you in danger
without any contingency plan?

454
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:54,656
Contingency plan?

455
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:58,785
<i>Soon, the whole building</i>

456
00:44:59,244 --> 00:45:01,037
<i>will be wiretapped.</i>

457
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:03,790
<i>Once you take care of the two,</i>

458
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:06,543
<i>just say, "I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."</i>

459
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:10,130
<i>Once we hear you say that,
our forces will break in secretly</i>

460
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:12,299
<i>and kill the last one.</i>

461
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,929
But they're just three spies.

462
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:20,766
Do you have to pull this kind of trick?

463
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:26,104
What I want is simple.
I just want to break in and kill them all.

464
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,273
But…

465
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,320
it turned out Eun's daughter
is one of the hostages.

466
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:37,866
Mr. Eun's daughter?

467
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:43,163
I can't just do as I want
beside the anxious father.

468
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:45,749
So it came to this.

469
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:53,048
Even if you're asking, I'm a doctor.
I can't kill a person. No, I won't.

470
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,176
Please. Do this for me, honey.

471
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:57,552
-Please.
-Instead,

472
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:00,889
I'll add sleep-inducing element
to the painkiller

473
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,474
and make them unconscious.

474
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:09,022
You wicked little fox.

475
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:11,525
Repeat the code phrase.

476
00:46:13,735 --> 00:46:16,947
"I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."

477
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:18,448
Good.

478
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,579
Area 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5

479
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:26,665
are ready to be wiretapped.

480
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,169
Eun!

481
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:32,963
-Sir.
-Hurry up.

482
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:37,050
It's nice to meet you.

483
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:38,635
You too.

484
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:40,554
Director Eun and Chief An.

485
00:46:41,513 --> 00:46:45,809
As far as we know, two of the spies
and one agent of ours are injured.

486
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,646
Judging by the gunfire, some of
the students might've gotten hurt too.

487
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:52,190
Will you be okay by yourself?

488
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:55,569
Dr. Kang's such an excellent doctor.

489
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:58,488
I noticed that one of the hostages
is a nursing major.

490
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:00,198
She can have them help her.

491
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:03,034
I'll be okay by myself.

492
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:07,455
We'll do our best to get you out safely
once you're done.

493
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:12,794
And agent Jang Han-na
will assist you well.

494
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:45,994
This is the list of the captured students.

495
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,543
Does any of them have an illness?

496
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:55,545
Why?

497
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:58,089
Just tell me if there's anyone
who must get out.

498
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,807
Those with illnesses are hard to handle,

499
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,852
but there are other students
harder to control.

500
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,855
This one sleepwalks every night.

501
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:18,109
And this one fearlessly protests
while throwing petrol bombs.

502
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:22,656
And this one's a nut job who always does

503
00:48:23,156 --> 00:48:24,991
what I tell her not to do.

504
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:37,128
Think about it.

505
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:39,714
They knew they'd be kicked out
if they broke the rules.

506
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:44,094
But they still deceived me
as well as ANSP agents…

507
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:47,639
They hid you inside the bench
in the sauna, didn't they?

508
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:49,724
Being all naked. Who does that?

509
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,686
They're so daring.

510
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:56,106
Yes, they're obedient for now,

511
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,150
but as time passes by,
they'll be hard to control.

512
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:01,569
If you think the girls are easy to handle,

513
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:03,113
you'll get in trouble.

514
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:12,288
It doesn't have to be students, does it?

515
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:15,583
<i>I said, shut your mouths!</i>

516
00:49:16,876 --> 00:49:18,795
I'm sorry.

517
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,939
I will keep my mouth shut.

518
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:39,357
Keep your heads down.

519
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:48,491
Everyone raise your heads.

520
00:49:59,753 --> 00:50:02,005
I'll release some of you right now.

521
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:09,429
As for the rest of you, I'll release

522
00:50:10,096 --> 00:50:13,099
those who are cooperative
next time or the next time after that.

523
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:18,146
But for those who disobey us

524
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:20,732
and are uncooperative,

525
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:24,944
there will be no release.

526
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:28,198
I, Oh Gwang-tea, will always

527
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:30,867
be cooperative.

528
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,410
I swear.

529
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:37,415
If you understood, be wise about it.

530
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,182
If your name is called,

531
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:56,392
stand up.

532
00:51:06,486 --> 00:51:08,613
Mr. Eun, they're calling names.

533
00:51:14,953 --> 00:51:16,287
Yeo Jeong-min.

534
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:21,835
<i>Ko Yu-na.</i>

535
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:23,169
Thank God!

536
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:27,799
-Shin Gyeong-ja.
-Here.

537
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:30,927
Ko Hye-ryeong.

538
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:34,973
I knew it!
I knew this wouldn't be the end of me.

539
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:42,730
Seo Eun-gyo.

540
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:44,607
Thank you!

541
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:45,608
Kim Ye-won.

542
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:48,403
<i>-Park Seon-ja.
-Here.</i>

543
00:51:48,486 --> 00:51:49,946
<i>Kang Tae-ji.</i>

544
00:51:51,156 --> 00:51:52,115
Yoon Seol-hui.

545
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:56,202
Thank you!

546
00:51:57,704 --> 00:51:59,372
Three from room 207?

547
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:01,291
It's suspicious.

548
00:52:01,374 --> 00:52:02,333
You're right.

549
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,751
It must be because of Yeong-ro.

550
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:06,588
What's this? Yeong-ro's roommates
are being treated specially?

551
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:08,506
This is so unfair.

552
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,092
Tell me about it. It's so obvious.

553
00:52:11,176 --> 00:52:13,469
-That can't be.
-It's possible.

554
00:52:13,553 --> 00:52:14,721
Of course it is.

555
00:52:17,891 --> 00:52:19,058
Quiet!

556
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:24,397
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:28,276
Can I tell you about myself a bit?

558
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:31,029
I, Oh Gwang-tae, grew up

559
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:33,990
with a single mom,
and like that wasn't enough,

560
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,161
I've gotten hepatitis A.

561
00:52:38,244 --> 00:52:39,454
If I stay here--

562
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,372
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:43,416
We'll never release you.

564
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:45,793
But I'm telling the truth.

565
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:48,463
-I really have it. I swear.
-Stop.

566
00:52:48,546 --> 00:52:49,839
Forget what I said.

567
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:51,633
You're such a loser.

568
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:58,473
Eun Yeong-ro.

569
00:53:04,187 --> 00:53:05,355
That's it.

570
00:53:07,357 --> 00:53:08,358
Eun Yeong-ro?

571
00:53:15,073 --> 00:53:16,199
Eun Yeong-ro.

572
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,081
You can't do this.

573
00:53:24,374 --> 00:53:25,917
Be quiet, Bun-ok.

574
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,252
You didn't ever hear us out.

575
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:29,337
Why are you only releasing students?

576
00:53:30,046 --> 00:53:33,341
What about me, Mr. Kim, and Ms. Oh?
We can't even get a chance?

577
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:35,385
This is unfair!

578
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,554
On what grounds did you decide on this?

579
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,516
On what grounds!

580
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,767
Shut your mouth!

581
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,186
She's so feisty.

582
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,482
This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?

583
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:52,860
She can't die and I can?

584
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:09,544
She's right.

585
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,047
Bun-ok is right.

586
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,009
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

587
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:19,345
<i>Release someone else.</i>

588
00:54:21,597 --> 00:54:23,766
How can I leave when they can't?

589
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:26,686
That's not right.

590
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:32,692
I'll stay too.

591
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:36,738
I played a big part too.

592
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:38,614
If Yeong-ro stays,

593
00:54:38,698 --> 00:54:41,451
I can't just leave her here
to save my skin.

594
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:45,788
Why don't we just draw lots?
That'll be fair.

595
00:54:51,044 --> 00:54:52,795
I totally agree!

596
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:54,714
-I agree.
-So do I.

597
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:07,977
Shut up! Quiet!

598
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:24,285
RÉSUMÉ
KYE BUN-OK

599
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:30,333
She's our telephone operator.

600
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,169
She's looking after her sick parents.

601
00:55:33,753 --> 00:55:36,798
She's a poor girl
who's the sole breadwinner.

602
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:40,301
I really hope you'll release her.

603
00:55:41,803 --> 00:55:43,721
You were the last one.

604
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:51,521
But not anymore.

605
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:11,624
You'll never get a chance to be released.

606
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,805
When I said those who disobey us
and are uncooperative

607
00:56:26,264 --> 00:56:29,308
wouldn't be released,
you should've taken it seriously.

608
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,147
Drawing lots?

609
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:39,193
I decide who gets released.

610
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:46,868
Hold on. Wait!

611
00:56:50,455 --> 00:56:55,126
In any case, we're being released, right?

612
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,470
Hey!

613
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:16,022
Because of that stupid Gizzard…

614
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:20,735
What a wench!

615
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:02,902
AREA 2-1
WIRETAPPED

616
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,035
Mr. An.

617
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:17,291
Gang-mu must be locked up
and sending us a message.

618
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:25,841
It seems
the hostages are locked in the cafeteria

619
00:58:25,925 --> 00:58:30,012
and Gang-mu is
locked in room 203 separately.

620
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:34,350
I think he's tied up in a separate room.

621
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:38,729
According to the blueprint, the distance
between the cafeteria and the room

622
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:41,524
is about 30 meters and…

623
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:50,366
I have a favor to ask.

624
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,619
Of course, you don't have to do it

625
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,415
because if we get caught,
you'll be put in danger too.

626
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:01,419
If that's the case,
let me hear you out first.

627
00:59:05,756 --> 00:59:06,591
This.

628
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:09,927
I want to give this to Mr. Lee.

629
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:13,889
How about we hide it in the medical kit?

630
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:17,518
They know who I am,
so it's impossible for me to bring it.

631
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:25,568
-Is the doctor ready?
<i>-Before that,</i>

632
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:28,279
I need to check if the students are safe.

633
00:59:28,362 --> 00:59:29,822
What are you trying to pull again?

634
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:31,657
To check if they're safe

635
00:59:31,741 --> 00:59:33,743
and to protect the doctor,

636
00:59:33,826 --> 00:59:35,828
one of our agents will accompany her.

637
00:59:35,911 --> 00:59:38,122
And please let the doctor
treat our agent too.

638
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,540
Look.

639
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,587
I can't guarantee what will happen
if they try anything else.

640
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:48,799
I give you my word.

641
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:09,654
Jang.

642
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:10,738
Yes, sir.

643
01:00:12,823 --> 01:00:14,909
They promised to let Gang-mu be treated.

644
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:17,453
So check if the students are okay first.

645
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:18,704
Yes, sir.

646
01:02:12,485 --> 01:02:13,736
Stop there.

647
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:19,408
Put down the bag.

648
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:34,465
Open it.

649
01:02:45,267 --> 01:02:46,227
Now.

650
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:00,908
Step back.

651
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:17,675
They're medical tools.

652
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:20,469
Please be careful not to contaminate them.

653
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:48,914
Go upstairs.

654
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,550
Go over it.

655
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,309
Just follow me.

656
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:25,242
Where are the hostages?

657
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:38,964
Gang-mu is with them, right?

658
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:40,382
Shut it.

659
01:04:41,926 --> 01:04:43,636
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

660
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:49,266
<i>And Gang-mu is</i>

661
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,769
locked in room 203 separately.

662
01:04:55,898 --> 01:04:56,732
To your left.

663
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,464
Comrade Lim.

664
01:05:51,203 --> 01:05:53,038
Move faster.

665
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:08,887
Comrade Joo, get the doctor here first.

666
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:13,976
I need someone to assist me.

667
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,895
I heard there's a nursing major here.

668
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:20,274
Kim Dong-ji.

669
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:21,525
Yes, ma'am.

670
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:24,528
She's the one.

671
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:27,906
Can you help me?

672
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,581
He's been running a fever since dawn.

673
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,474
If he's over 38°C, he can't have surgery.

674
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,642
I must give him
a fever reducer and antibiotics

675
01:06:55,726 --> 01:06:57,394
to reduce the fever first.

676
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:03,233
I heard two of you are injured.

677
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:05,069
Where's the other one?

678
01:07:07,237 --> 01:07:08,489
Comrade Joo.

679
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,126
Get treated.

680
01:07:49,363 --> 01:07:53,117
Hello, sir. This is
Hong Ae-ra. You remember me, right?

681
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,369
I called to ask you something.

682
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:00,457
You told me the other day
that for my husband to become president,

683
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:03,836
13 young virgins must
be offered as sacrifices, right?

684
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:12,094
But does it have to be exactly 13 people?

685
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,016
Oh, I see.

686
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:22,646
Thank you. I'll come visit you soon.

687
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:29,820
Ma'am, it's all ready.

688
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:46,461
I can see all of the 64 hostages are safe.

689
01:08:46,545 --> 01:08:48,589
How many of them will you release?

690
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:56,180
Rescue Mr. Eun's daughter first
no matter what.

691
01:08:58,098 --> 01:09:01,018
The doctor needs to treat them anyway,

692
01:09:01,393 --> 01:09:04,855
so why don't you just release them too?

693
01:09:10,027 --> 01:09:11,778
I think that'll be better for both of us.

694
01:09:16,116 --> 01:09:17,409
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

695
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,036
Here!

696
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:20,204
What's going on?

697
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:22,915
Hey, Ms. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong?

698
01:09:22,998 --> 01:09:24,208
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

699
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:25,709
Hold on.

700
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:28,170
Drink water.

701
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:31,298
What's wrong?
Do you have trouble breathing?

702
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:32,382
Attention.

703
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:37,596
I'll select people who will be released.

704
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:47,648
<i>If you disobey me this time again,</i>

705
01:09:49,024 --> 01:09:50,567
you won't get out of here alive.

706
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,285
You.

707
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:05,791
You.

708
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,835
<i>You.</i>

709
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:11,463
<i>You.</i>

710
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:13,340
"You"? Damn it.

711
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:16,009
Why isn't this bastard
calling their names?

712
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:18,387
Who is he picking?

713
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,973
Don't you think we need to find it out?

714
01:10:22,307 --> 01:10:25,310
Damn it. My blood pressure.

715
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:27,354
The six of you will get out too.

716
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:37,990
God damn bastard.

717
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:40,242
Everyone I selected, come out.

718
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:50,043
Yu-na.

719
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:51,712
What's wrong, Yu-na?

720
01:10:51,795 --> 01:10:54,256
-He's having trouble breathing.
-What's wrong?

721
01:10:54,339 --> 01:10:56,925
-Are you okay?
-Yu-na.

722
01:10:57,843 --> 01:11:00,262
-Go get a plastic bag. Now!
-I'll go.

723
01:11:03,348 --> 01:11:05,267
Yu-na, you're okay.

724
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,978
You won't die. Everything will be okay.

725
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:09,688
Have her breathe into it. Hurry.

726
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,858
Breathe. Breathe deeply.

727
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:16,611
Deeply and slowly.

728
01:11:19,364 --> 01:11:22,659
I'm so scared.

729
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:26,705
I think the stress is too much for her.

730
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:30,000
Can't you release her too?

731
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,044
Me too!

732
01:11:32,127 --> 01:11:33,962
-I can't stand it any longer!
-Me too!

733
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:36,673
-Me too!
-Me too!

734
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:37,883
-Me too!
-Me too!

735
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:40,344
-Me too!
-It should be us!

736
01:11:40,427 --> 01:11:42,304
-This is a women's dorm!
-Me too!

737
01:11:42,387 --> 01:11:44,306
-Why do I have to keep quiet?
-Me too!

738
01:11:44,389 --> 01:11:47,726
-Listen to what we have to say too!
-Me too!

739
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,854
-Let us men go too!
-Me too!

740
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:52,481
-God damn it!
-Me too!

741
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:54,775
-Why do we have to be here?
-Me too!

742
01:11:54,858 --> 01:11:56,109
Enough!

743
01:11:58,278 --> 01:12:00,030
Who wants to die first?

744
01:12:00,864 --> 01:12:01,698
Who?

745
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:02,824
Stop!

746
01:12:24,221 --> 01:12:26,515
Who are you to decide who gets to live?

747
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:31,561
<i>Only I will be enough.</i>

748
01:12:34,272 --> 01:12:35,774
<i>I'll stay, so release all of them.</i>

749
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,567
Let them all go!

750
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:49,746
Keep your heads down!

751
01:12:54,376 --> 01:12:56,420
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

752
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,926
You leave.

753
01:13:06,638 --> 01:13:08,265
This is our dorm.

754
01:13:09,349 --> 01:13:11,309
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

755
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:15,313
Oh, my goodness.

756
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,484
-You're not done.
-Let go.

757
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:21,236
I'll kill this damn wench.

758
01:13:51,308 --> 01:13:53,852
Please let them go. They're innocent.

759
01:14:15,749 --> 01:14:16,750
You…

760
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:20,629
You don't know who I am, do you?

761
01:14:36,478 --> 01:14:37,854
I'll tell you.

762
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:44,069
I'm…

763
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:48,490
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

764
01:14:57,749 --> 01:14:59,417
Eun Chang-su,

765
01:14:59,918 --> 01:15:02,254
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

766
01:15:04,256 --> 01:15:06,091
is my father.

767
01:15:38,957 --> 01:15:42,043
She hid him? Hid the communist spy?
Your daughter really did it?

768
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:45,755
<i>Does hiding a spy count as espionage?</i>

769
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:50,260
<i>You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?</i>

770
01:15:52,345 --> 01:15:54,264
You son of a b****!

771
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,725
<i>I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.</i>

772
01:15:56,808 --> 01:15:58,393
What kind of deal did you make?

773
01:15:58,476 --> 01:16:01,479
<i>We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.</i>

774
01:16:01,646 --> 01:16:03,732
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars?

775
01:16:03,815 --> 01:16:07,485
<i>I'm sure our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.</i>

776
01:16:08,486 --> 01:16:09,571
Kill them.

777
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:13,325
Director Eun Chang-su won't
even find his daughter's body.

778
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,577
Please.

779
01:16:16,411 --> 01:16:17,245
Kill me.

BONUS

782
01:16:34,262 --> 01:16:37,932
-One, two.
-Careful.

783
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:40,268
We must take them down
before they blow themselves up!

784
01:16:40,352 --> 01:16:43,563
What if we break in rashly
and get the hostages killed, you bastard?

785
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,939
What? "Bastard"?

786
01:16:45,023 --> 01:16:46,316
How dare you call me that?

787
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,653
Just get lost. This is my jurisdiction!

788
01:16:49,736 --> 01:16:52,030
You always dilly-dally and are indecisive,

789
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:55,367
and that's why all this has happened.
You're a liability to us!

790
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:59,287
You always blame others,
and that's why this is happening!

791
01:16:59,621 --> 01:17:01,373
Whose fault is this?

792
01:17:01,456 --> 01:17:04,334
A soft boy like you can
never serve the country well.

793
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:07,253
You killed your former superior
on the pretext of serving the country.

794
01:17:07,337 --> 01:17:08,880
Do you call that serving the country?

795
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:11,966
What do you know about revolution?

796
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,678
Just discipline your son better.

797
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:17,764
You piece of s***, how dare you talk
about my son with your dirty mouth?

798
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:22,686
What did you say? Do you want to die?
I must've gone too easy on you!

799
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:24,396
<i>What? "Gone easy on me"?</i>

800
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:26,564
<i>-You God damn bastard!
-Let go, you s***!</i>

801
01:17:26,815 --> 01:17:27,649
<i>I'll just--</i>

802
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:29,693
<i>-Get lost already!
-God damn it!</i>
