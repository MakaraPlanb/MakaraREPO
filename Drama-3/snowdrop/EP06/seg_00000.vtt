ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.859 line:14.17%,start
EPISODE 6

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:16.868 line:14.17%,start
Nowâ€¦

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.746 line:14.17%,start
Plan B is the only option now.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.248 line:14.17%,start
And in order for it to succeed,

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.335 line:14.17%,start
we must kill them all.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.049 line:14.17%,start
As soon as they come out,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.676 line:14.17%,start
-kill them all.
-Mr. Nam,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.680 line:14.17%,start
even if we go with plan B, if we kill
them, the North won't sit back--

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.598 line:14.17%,start
What if they won't?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.975 line:14.17%,start
We made a deal--

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.153 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll disclose
that we made a deal?

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.656 line:85.83%,end
We have no choice but
to exaggerate the engagement.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.659 line:85.83%,end
If the North throws a monkey wrench
into the works, it'll fail!

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.286 line:85.83%,end
You think they're that stupid?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.289 line:85.83%,end
You think they'll refuse the chance
to make huge money every election?

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.584 line:85.83%,end
But if it fails,
the hostages' lives will be in danger!

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:07.669 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.297 line:85.83%,end
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.842 line:85.83%,end
Everyone, retreat.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.652 line:85.83%,end
This is HQ. Ambush team,
we're going in for the kill.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.654 line:85.83%,end
Once the targets are in the zone,

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.197 line:85.83%,end
kill them at all costs.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:21.534 line:85.83%,end
The targets appeared. All units,
they're approaching the kill zone.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.702 line:85.83%,end
Stand by.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.961 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.383 line:85.83%,end
Stop.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.735 line:85.83%,end
Three targets, armed with AK-47s.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.977 line:85.83%,end
A change of plan. Open fire.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:35.858 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.252 line:85.83%,end
Everyone, calm down.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.714 line:85.83%,end
I think they're trying to escape
through the exit in basement two.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.341 line:85.83%,end
And I'll go after them right now.
