00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.302 line:85.83%,end
So everyone stay here.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.347 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.203 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol, hold me.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.679 line:85.83%,end
You bastards!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.432 line:85.83%,end
It's a grenade! Get down!

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:55.438 line:85.83%,end
All units, fire!

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.782 line:85.83%,end
Get out of here! Hurry up!

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.046 line:85.83%,end
Four of our guys are injured.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.298 line:85.83%,end
It looks like the plan failed.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.262 line:85.83%,end
I'll kill them all.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.283 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol!

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.618 line:85.83%,end
Get it together.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:26.404 line:85.83%,end
<i>We're going in.
We'll go in and secure the targets.</i>

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:27.822 line:85.83%,end
Hey, halt! Halt!

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.866 line:85.83%,end
This is the director of ANSP. Halt!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.543 line:85.83%,end
If the students are killed,
we'll be doomed!

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.714 line:85.83%,end
Why do you think
this happened in the first place?

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.175 line:85.83%,end
Exaggerating the engagement won't help us!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.052 line:85.83%,end
Let's just go in and eliminate them all!

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.889 line:85.83%,end
Are you insane?
What if all the hostages are killed?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.349 line:85.83%,end
I'll deal with the communist jerks,

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.768 line:85.83%,end
so you stay out of it, scaredy-cat.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.062 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, listen--

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.149 line:85.83%,end
If you stab them in the back twice,
how will you negotiate with them?

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.902 line:85.83%,end
You think you can bury this
without anyone knowing?

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.807 line:85.83%,end
You made sure
no one will talk about this, right?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.477 line:85.83%,end
If anyone asks about this
hostage situation, just lock them all up!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.728 line:85.83%,end
We already

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.065 line:85.83%,end
took necessary measures just in case.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.109 line:85.83%,end
We told the shop owners

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:31.696 line:85.83%,end
that we were catching deserters.
And we made sure

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:33.281 line:85.83%,end
to keep the press quiet about it.

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:35.491 line:85.83%,end
But your daughterâ€¦

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.001 line:85.83%,end
Do you think the other hostages are okay?

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:47.795 line:85.83%,end
Put me through to the dorm.
