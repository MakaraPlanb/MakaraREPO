Who are you to decide who gets to live?

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:19.561 line:85.83%,end
<i>Only I will be enough.</i>

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:23.774 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll stay, so release all of them.</i>

01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:25.567 line:85.83%,end
Let them all go!

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.746 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down!

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.420 line:85.83%,end
I told you I decide who gets to leave.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:50.926 line:85.83%,end
You leave.

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.265 line:85.83%,end
This is our dorm.

01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:59.309 line:85.83%,end
This is our dorm, you stupid communist!

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:03.313 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.484 line:85.83%,end
-You're not done.
-Let go.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.236 line:85.83%,end
I'll kill this damn wench.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.852 line:85.83%,end
Please let them go. They're innocent.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:04.750 line:85.83%,end
You…

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.629 line:85.83%,end
You don't know who I am, do you?

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:25.854 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you.

01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.069 line:85.83%,end
I'm…

01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:36.490 line:85.83%,end
the daughter of the director of ANSP.

01:15:45.749 --> 01:15:47.417 line:85.83%,end
Eun Chang-su,

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.254 line:85.83%,end
the director of
the Agency for National Security Planning…

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.091 line:85.83%,end
is my father.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:30.043 line:85.83%,end
She hid him? Hid the communist spy?
Your daughter really did it?

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:33.755 line:85.83%,end
<i>Does hiding a spy count as espionage?</i>

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.260 line:85.83%,end
<i>You've fooled us twice today,
and what? Promise?</i>

01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:42.264 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****!

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:44.725 line:85.83%,end
<i>I bet all you're thinking about
is killing us.</i>

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:46.393 line:14.17%,start
What kind of deal did you make?

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:49.479 line:14.17%,start
<i>We have bait
that's worth 300 million dollars.</i>

01:16:49.646 --> 01:16:51.732 line:14.17%,start
Will Lim Ji-rok
give up the 300 million dollars?

01:16:51.815 --> 01:16:55.485 line:14.17%,start
<i>I'm sure our spies consider
dying for our party honorable.</i>

01:16:56.486 --> 01:16:57.571 line:14.17%,start
Kill them.

01:16:57.654 --> 01:17:01.325 line:14.17%,start
Director Eun Chang-su won't
even find his daughter's body.

01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:03.577 line:14.17%,start
Please.

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:05.245 line:14.17%,start
Kill me.

01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:25.932 line:85.83%,end
-One, two.
-Careful.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.268 line:85.83%,end
We must take them down
before they blow themselves up!

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:31.563 line:85.83%,end
What if we break in rashly
and get the hostages killed, you bastard?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:32.939 line:85.83%,end
What? "Bastard"?

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:34.316 line:85.83%,end
How dare you call me that?

01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:37.653 line:85.83%,end
Just get lost. This is my jurisdiction!

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:40.030 line:85.83%,end
You always dilly-dally and are indecisive,

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:43.367 line:85.83%,end
and that's why all this has happened.
You're a liability to us!

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:47.287 line:85.83%,end
You always blame others,
and that's why this is happening!

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:49.373 line:85.83%,end
Whose fault is this?

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:52.334 line:85.83%,end
A soft boy like you can
never serve the country well.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:55.253 line:85.83%,end
You killed your former superior
on the pretext of serving the country.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:56.880 line:85.83%,end
Do you call that serving the country?

01:17:56.963 --> 01:17:59.966 line:85.83%,end
What do you know about revolution?

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.678 line:85.83%,end
Just discipline your son better.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:05.764 line:85.83%,end
You piece of s***, how dare you talk
about my son with your dirty mouth?

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:10.686 line:85.83%,end
What did you say? Do you want to die?
I must've gone too easy on you!

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.396 line:85.83%,end
<i>What? "Gone easy on me"?</i>

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:14.564 line:85.83%,end
<i>-You God damn bastard!
-Let go, you s***!</i>

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:15.649 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll just--</i>

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:17.693 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Get lost already!
-God damn it!</i>
