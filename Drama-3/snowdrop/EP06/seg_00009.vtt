00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.525 line:85.83%,end
Repeat the code phrase.

00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:04.947 line:85.83%,end
"I gave them painkiller,
so they'll be fine."

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:06.448 line:85.83%,end
Good.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.579 line:85.83%,end
Area 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.665 line:85.83%,end
are ready to be wiretapped.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.169 line:85.83%,end
Eun!

00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:20.963 line:85.83%,end
-Sir.
-Hurry up.

00:47:23.757 --> 00:47:25.050 line:85.83%,end
It's nice to meet you.

00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:26.635 line:85.83%,end
You too.

00:47:26.718 --> 00:47:28.554 line:85.83%,end
Director Eun and Chief An.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:33.809 line:85.83%,end
As far as we know, two of the spies
and one agent of ours are injured.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.646 line:85.83%,end
Judging by the gunfire, some of
the students might've gotten hurt too.

00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:40.190 line:85.83%,end
Will you be okay by yourself?

00:47:40.816 --> 00:47:43.569 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang's such an excellent doctor.

00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:46.488 line:85.83%,end
I noticed that one of the hostages
is a nursing major.

00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:48.198 line:85.83%,end
She can have them help her.

00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:51.034 line:85.83%,end
I'll be okay by myself.

00:47:52.452 --> 00:47:55.455 line:85.83%,end
We'll do our best to get you out safely
once you're done.

00:47:55.956 --> 00:48:00.794 line:85.83%,end
And agent Jang Han-na
will assist you well.

00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:33.994 line:85.83%,end
This is the list of the captured students.

00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:41.543 line:85.83%,end
Does any of them have an illness?

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:43.545 line:85.83%,end
Why?

00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:46.089 line:85.83%,end
Just tell me if there's anyone
who must get out.

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:55.807 line:85.83%,end
Those with illnesses are hard to handle,

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:58.852 line:85.83%,end
but there are other students
harder to control.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.855 line:85.83%,end
This one sleepwalks every night.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:06.109 line:85.83%,end
And this one fearlessly protests
while throwing petrol bombs.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:10.656 line:85.83%,end
And this one's a nut job who always does

00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:12.991 line:85.83%,end
what I tell her not to do.

00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:25.128 line:85.83%,end
Think about it.

00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:27.714 line:85.83%,end
They knew they'd be kicked out
if they broke the rules.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:32.094 line:85.83%,end
But they still deceived me
as well as ANSP agentsâ€¦

00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:35.639 line:85.83%,end
They hid you inside the bench
in the sauna, didn't they?

00:49:35.722 --> 00:49:37.724 line:85.83%,end
Being all naked. Who does that?

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.686 line:85.83%,end
They're so daring.

00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:44.106 line:85.83%,end
Yes, they're obedient for now,

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.150 line:85.83%,end
but as time passes by,
they'll be hard to control.

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.569 line:85.83%,end
If you think the girls are easy to handle,

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:51.113 line:85.83%,end
you'll get in trouble.

00:49:57.285 --> 00:50:00.288 line:85.83%,end
It doesn't have to be students, does it?

00:50:02.207 --> 00:50:03.583 line:85.83%,end
<i>I said, shut your mouths!</i>

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:06.795 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.

00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:25.939 line:85.83%,end
I will keep my mouth shut.

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.357 line:85.83%,end
Keep your heads down.

00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:36.491 line:85.83%,end
Everyone raise your heads.

00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:50.005 line:85.83%,end
I'll release some of you right now.

00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:57.429 line:85.83%,end
As for the rest of you, I'll release

00:50:58.096 --> 00:51:01.099 line:85.83%,end
those who are cooperative
next time or the next time after that.

00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:06.146 line:85.83%,end
But for those who disobey us

00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:08.732 line:85.83%,end
and are uncooperative,

00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:12.944 line:85.83%,end
there will be no release.

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:16.198 line:85.83%,end
I, Oh Gwang-tea, will always

00:51:16.782 --> 00:51:18.867 line:85.83%,end
be cooperative.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.410 line:85.83%,end
I swear.

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:25.415 line:85.83%,end
If you understood, be wise about it.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.182 line:85.83%,end
If your name is called,

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:44.392 line:85.83%,end
stand up.

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:56.613 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun, they're calling names.
