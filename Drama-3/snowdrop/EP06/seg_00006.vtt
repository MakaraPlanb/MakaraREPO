00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:47.155 line:85.83%,end
PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR KIM IL SUNG,
DEAR LEADER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.951 line:85.83%,end
Because your son failed the mission,

00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:54.287 line:85.83%,end
we lost 300 million dollars.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.205 line:85.83%,end
The party's 300 million dollars.

00:31:56.956 --> 00:31:59.792 line:85.83%,end
Have you forgotten our Leader
ordered us to get it done at all costs?

00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:02.587 line:85.83%,end
It's too early

00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:05.506 line:85.83%,end
to say the mission has failed.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:08.760 line:85.83%,end
Too early?

00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:12.138 line:85.83%,end
You think your son,
who's holding people hostage

00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:13.765 line:85.83%,end
in the middle of Seoul,

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:17.143 line:85.83%,end
will come back with 300 million dollars?

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:23.191 line:85.83%,end
The party will make a decision soon.
Prepare yourself.

00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:33.201 line:85.83%,end
We failed our mission,
so there's only one option left for us.

00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:37.080 line:85.83%,end
To kill them all

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.625 line:85.83%,end
and blow ourselves up.

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:46.923 line:85.83%,end
It's too early for that. We must try
our best to go back alive until the end.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.217 line:85.83%,end
I'll buy as much time as--

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.095 line:85.83%,end
We shouldn't beg them for negotiation.
Blowing ourselves up…

00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.433 line:85.83%,end
is the only way
to defend the honor of our Leader.

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.108 line:85.83%,end
We'll be dying for nothing.

00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:07.902 line:85.83%,end
Dying for nothing?

00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:20.999 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****.

00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:23.668 line:85.83%,end
You dare to call it dying for nothing?

00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.548 line:85.83%,end
To shoot all the hostages dead

00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:31.300 line:85.83%,end
and blow ourselves up in a determined way

00:33:31.384 --> 00:33:33.886 line:85.83%,end
is the most honorable death for us!

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:38.433 line:85.83%,end
I'll decide if we must die or not.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:40.727 line:85.83%,end
I'm your leader.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.439 line:85.83%,end
You're just a soft guy
from a powerful family. How dare you

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.024 line:85.83%,end
disrespect the revolutionary spirit?

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.028 line:85.83%,end
It would've gone smoothly
if you hadn't come to the dorm!

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.622 line:85.83%,end
Hey, Yeong-ro. Do something.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:04.000 line:85.83%,end
You and he must be close.

00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:05.710 line:85.83%,end
Do something for us!

00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:07.462 line:85.83%,end
What could she do?

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.673 line:85.83%,end
we were also fooled.
She didn't know he was a spy either.

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:11.799 line:85.83%,end
She didn't?

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.135 line:85.83%,end
Look what she got us into.
"I didn't know" won't cut it.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.971 line:85.83%,end
You guys from room 207
are accomplices. So be quiet.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:20.683 line:85.83%,end
Accomplices?
Look, I'm also mad at Yeong-ro.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:23.186 line:85.83%,end
I told you we shouldn't have hid him!

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:30.234 line:85.83%,end
But it is true that we really thought
he was a college student we met on a date.

00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.528 line:85.83%,end
And you met him with us.

00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:36.407 line:85.83%,end
She's right.
And he was your partner that day.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.825 line:85.83%,end
-Partner?
-Bun-ok's partner?

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.077 line:85.83%,end
She joined them?

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.788 line:85.83%,end
So you think you did nothing wrong?

00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.414 line:85.83%,end
Stop arguing!

00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:45.291 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP agent was just dragged out.

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:48.044 line:85.83%,end
We must find a way to get out alive.

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:49.420 line:85.83%,end
Why take it out on me?

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:52.215 line:85.83%,end
You think we can find any way
in this situation?

00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:55.885 line:85.83%,end
Byeong-tae!

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.428 line:85.83%,end
Do something.

00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:00.765 line:85.83%,end
You'll be commissioned soon.
Will you just sit back?

00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:03.810 line:85.83%,end
Isn't there any manual
for a situation like this?

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:05.895 line:85.83%,end
Actually…

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.192 line:85.83%,end
There's nothing in particular.

00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:15.822 line:85.83%,end
But…

00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:21.410 line:85.83%,end
With my great leadership

00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:24.413 line:85.83%,end
and sense of duty to save your lives,
let me tell you something.

00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:28.417 line:85.83%,end
In 1972, there was a hostage situation
during the Munich Olympics.

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:32.296 line:85.83%,end
And the West German police
dealt with it in such an idiotic way,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.506 line:85.83%,end
so all the hostages

00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:35.299 line:85.83%,end
were killed.

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.386 line:85.83%,end
-Oh, no.
-All of them?

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.056 line:85.83%,end
You didn't know?
It's a well-known tragedy.

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:46.602 line:85.83%,end
Anyway, even the West German
police failed like that.

00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:48.896 line:85.83%,end
So the Korean police and ANSP…

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.900 line:85.83%,end
We should never count on them.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.282 line:85.83%,end
For now,

00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:01.742 line:85.83%,end
those bastards…

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.494 line:85.83%,end
We should

00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:07.373 line:85.83%,end
do as those bastards say
if we want to stay alive.

00:36:07.456 --> 00:36:09.542 line:85.83%,end
God, you idiot!

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:12.170 line:85.83%,end
-You stupid…
-What?

00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:13.504 line:85.83%,end
You idiot.

00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:15.673 line:85.83%,end
You little…

00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:19.635 line:85.83%,end
Keep quiet!

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:24.182 line:85.83%,end
How will you handle
the consequences of the failed mission?

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.519 line:85.83%,end
I'm the leader.
I'll take full responsibility.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.813 line:85.83%,end
You did nothing wrong.

00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:33.399 line:85.83%,end
I'll go back alive at all cost
and take responsibility.

00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.525 line:85.83%,end
Responsibility?

00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:39.822 line:85.83%,end
You're a coward begging for your life
even after being fooled twice.

00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:42.325 line:85.83%,end
How will you do that?
