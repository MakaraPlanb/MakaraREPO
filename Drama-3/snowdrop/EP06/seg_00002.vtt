00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:11.986 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:37.678 line:85.83%,end
You son of a b****!

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.192 line:85.83%,end
You murderer.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.945 line:85.83%,end
You bastard!

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:00.534 line:85.83%,end
How dare you kill my husband?

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:12.380 line:85.83%,end
Who gave you the right to kill him?

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:20.346 line:85.83%,end
You murderer!

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.140 line:85.83%,end
How dare you!

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.353 line:85.83%,end
Bring her here.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.898 line:85.83%,end
You're all right. Calm down.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.862 line:85.83%,end
Twice.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.448 line:85.83%,end
They deceived us twice!

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.368 line:85.83%,end
You wasted our precious bullets.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.038 line:85.83%,end
It's always an emotional prick
like you that ruins a mission.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.460 line:85.83%,end
You need to be coolheaded
in a situation like this.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.255 line:85.83%,end
If you keep this up,
I won't need you anymore.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.264 line:85.83%,end
Everyone go back to the cafeteria.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.894 line:85.83%,end
Now!

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.409 line:85.83%,end
I'll watch the cafeteria.
You go bring Eung-cheol.

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:08.537 line:85.83%,end
And lock him in another room.

00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:12.166 line:85.83%,end
You two.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:14.960 line:85.83%,end
Follow me.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.674 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir!

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.609 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:41.320 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:42.822 line:85.83%,end
It's the military situation room.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.042 line:85.83%,end
Hey, have you looked into the casualties?

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.294 line:85.83%,end
Ask about Han I-seop first.

00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.631 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir!
All of the armed spies were killed.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:05.636 line:85.83%,end
And Professor Han who was with them
was killed by one of the Northern spies.

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:06.679 line:85.83%,end
Is he dead?

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.266 line:85.83%,end
How about our casualties?

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:13.769 line:85.83%,end
One killed in action
and four injured, sir.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:16.814 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u!

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.233 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u, stay with me!

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.279 line:85.83%,end
You'll be okay. Hang in there.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.001 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell their families just yet.

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:39.628 line:85.83%,end
And ask the press for a news embargo.

00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:45.134 line:85.83%,end
Here. We need help here.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.430 line:85.83%,end
Chief An.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:52.308 line:85.83%,end
Tell the press that Han I-seop died
while defecting to the North.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.727 line:85.83%,end
-Defecting to the North?
-Yes.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.313 line:85.83%,end
<i>But he was the
opposition party's mentor in economics.</i>

00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:58.480 line:85.83%,end
An.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.442 line:85.83%,end
Just tell them the North abducted him
and we tried to rescue him.

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:04.403 line:85.83%,end
Inspiring the people's sense
of national security will help us--

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.282 line:85.83%,end
You want to stop there
when we can win the game?

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:11.744 line:85.83%,end
If the opposition party raises an issue,
we will be counterattacked.
