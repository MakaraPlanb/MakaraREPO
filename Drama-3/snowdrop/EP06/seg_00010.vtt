Yeo Jeong-min.

<i>Ko Yu-na.</i>

00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:11.169 line:85.83%,end
Thank God!

00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:15.799 line:85.83%,end
-Shin Gyeong-ja.
-Here.

00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:18.927 line:85.83%,end
Ko Hye-ryeong.

00:52:19.594 --> 00:52:22.973 line:85.83%,end
I knew it!
I knew this wouldn't be the end of me.

00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:30.730 line:85.83%,end
Seo Eun-gyo.

00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:32.607 line:85.83%,end
Thank you!

00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:33.608 line:85.83%,end
Kim Ye-won.

00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:36.403 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Park Seon-ja.

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:40.115 line:85.83%,end
Yoon Seol-hui.

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.202 line:85.83%,end
Thank you!

00:52:45.704 --> 00:52:47.372 line:85.83%,end
Three from room 207?

00:52:47.956 --> 00:52:49.291 line:85.83%,end
It's suspicious.

00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:50.333 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.751 line:85.83%,end
It must be because of Yeong-ro.

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.588 line:85.83%,end
What's this? Yeong-ro's roommates
are being treated specially?

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.506 line:85.83%,end
This is so unfair.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.092 line:85.83%,end
Tell me about it. It's so obvious.

00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.469 line:85.83%,end
-That can't be.
-It's possible.

00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:02.721 line:85.83%,end
Of course it is.

00:53:05.891 --> 00:53:07.058 line:85.83%,end
Quiet!

00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:12.397 line:85.83%,end
Excuse me, sir.

00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:16.276 line:85.83%,end
Can I tell you about myself a bit?

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:19.029 line:85.83%,end
I, Oh Gwang-tae, grew up

00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:21.990 line:85.83%,end
with a single mom,
and like that wasn't enough,

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.161 line:85.83%,end
I've gotten hepatitis A.

00:53:26.244 --> 00:53:27.454 line:85.83%,end
If I stay here--

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.372 line:85.83%,end
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

00:53:29.956 --> 00:53:31.416 line:85.83%,end
We'll never release you.

00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.793 line:85.83%,end
But I'm telling the truth.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.463 line:85.83%,end
-I really have it. I swear.
-Stop.

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:37.839 line:85.83%,end
Forget what I said.

00:53:38.423 --> 00:53:39.633 line:85.83%,end
You're such a loser.

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.473 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro.

00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.355 line:85.83%,end
That's it.

00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:56.358 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro?

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.199 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro.

00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:11.081 line:85.83%,end
You can't do this.

00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:13.917 line:85.83%,end
Be quiet, Bun-ok.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.252 line:85.83%,end
You didn't ever hear us out.

00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:17.337 line:85.83%,end
Why are you only releasing students?

00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:21.341 line:85.83%,end
What about me, Mr. Kim, and Ms. Oh?
We can't even get a chance?

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:23.385 line:85.83%,end
This is unfair!

00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:26.554 line:85.83%,end
On what grounds did you decide on this?

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:29.516 line:85.83%,end
On what grounds!

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:30.767 line:85.83%,end
Shut your mouth!

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.186 line:85.83%,end
She's so feisty.

00:54:34.896 --> 00:54:37.482 line:85.83%,end
This all happened because of her.
Why does she get to leave?

00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.860 line:85.83%,end
She can't die and I can?

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:57.544 line:85.83%,end
She's right.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.047 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok is right.

00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.009 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.345 line:85.83%,end
<i>Release someone else.</i>

00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:11.766 line:85.83%,end
How can I leave when they can't?

00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:14.686 line:85.83%,end
That's not right.

00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:20.692 line:85.83%,end
I'll stay too.

00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:24.738 line:85.83%,end
I played a big part too.

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.614 line:85.83%,end
If Yeong-ro stays,

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:29.451 line:85.83%,end
I can't just leave her here
to save my skin.

00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:33.788 line:85.83%,end
Why don't we just draw lots?
That'll be fair.

00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:40.795 line:85.83%,end
I totally agree!

00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.714 line:85.83%,end
-I agree.
-So do I.

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:55.977 line:85.83%,end
Shut up! Quiet!

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:12.285 line:85.83%,end
RÃ‰SUMÃ‰
KYE BUN-OK

00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:18.333 line:85.83%,end
She's our telephone operator.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:21.169 line:85.83%,end
She's looking after her sick parents.

00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:24.798 line:85.83%,end
She's a poor girl
who's the sole breadwinner.

00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:28.301 line:85.83%,end
I really hope you'll release her.

00:56:29.803 --> 00:56:31.721 line:85.83%,end
You were the last one.

00:56:38.144 --> 00:56:39.521 line:85.83%,end
But not anymore.

00:56:56.996 --> 00:56:59.624 line:85.83%,end
You'll never get a chance to be released.
