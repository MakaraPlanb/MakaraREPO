00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:30.187 line:85.83%,end
I said, wait.

00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:42.658 line:85.83%,end
I'm okay, sir.

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:44.660 line:85.83%,end
No, you're not, you punk.

00:21:08.016 --> 00:21:11.853 line:85.83%,end
Fortunately,
you didn't hurt any arteries or veins.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.232 line:85.83%,end
I could even take
an axe blade with my abs.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.901 line:85.83%,end
So this wound is nothing.

00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:19.903 line:85.83%,end
I can survive this.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.165 line:85.83%,end
It should be treated.

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:38.315 line:85.83%,end
Let everyone go.

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.869 line:85.83%,end
If you feel bad for me just a little bit,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.873 line:85.83%,end
let them go. Please.

00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:03.131 line:85.83%,end
Let them go.

00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:19.022 line:85.83%,end
Tomorrow morning, I'll demand a doctor
who will treat Eung-cheol's wound.

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:22.442 line:85.83%,end
They'll demand the release of a hostage.

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:25.070 line:85.83%,end
And I'mâ€¦

00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:29.533 line:85.83%,end
planning to release you.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:35.664 line:85.83%,end
To repay you for what you've done
for me these past few days.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.584 line:85.83%,end
We'll be even then.

00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:46.007 line:85.83%,end
"Even"?

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.352 line:85.83%,end
Go back to the cafeteria.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.214 line:85.83%,end
Look at her.

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.425 line:85.83%,end
Her hand is bandaged.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.470 line:85.83%,end
-What? Bandage?
-She's right.

00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:32.888 line:85.83%,end
He treated her?

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:35.098 line:85.83%,end
But why treat only her?

00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:26.483 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho?

00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:29.110 line:85.83%,end
Are you guys okay?
