00:25:30.237 --> 00:25:31.738 line:85.83%,end
I'll speak to the person in charge.

00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:35.492 line:85.83%,end
There are people who don't agree with me,
so it went awry.

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.078 line:85.83%,end
<i>But I'm still willing to get you out</i>

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.704 line:85.83%,end
safely and--

00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.832 line:85.83%,end
I'll talk to the person
who ordered to kill us.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:45.544 line:85.83%,end
I'm the person in charge here.
I'm the director of ANSP.

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:52.551 line:85.83%,end
So you're the one
who ordered to kill us, you bastard?

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.302 line:85.83%,end
What? "Bastard"?

00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.888 line:85.83%,end
How dare this communist call you that?

00:25:56.972 --> 00:26:00.183 line:85.83%,end
Give it. I'll teach him a lesson. Give it!

00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:02.102 line:85.83%,end
Stop it, you idiot!

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:08.942 line:85.83%,end
Don't deal with him. Why don't you
go home? I'll take care of this.

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:10.652 line:85.83%,end
You'll take care of this?

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:11.903 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you go home?

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:14.698 line:85.83%,end
You're not coolheaded,
desperate to save your child.

00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:15.615 line:85.83%,end
You little…

00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:19.786 line:85.83%,end
Are you trying to get her killed?

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.081 line:85.83%,end
If they find out,
what do you think they'll do?

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.172 line:85.83%,end
What're you looking at?

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:40.724 line:85.83%,end
There was an engagement on the West Sea
at around 22:00.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:43.560 line:85.83%,end
An engagement?

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:47.272 line:85.83%,end
<i>The ship for the North was
stupid enough to be get caught.</i>

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:52.277 line:85.83%,end
The navy found the ship,
so there was nothing I could do.

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:55.030 line:85.83%,end
And my colleagues?

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:55.947 line:85.83%,end
<i>Before that…</i>

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.075 line:85.83%,end
I heard gunfire. Are the students okay?

00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:06.124 line:85.83%,end
If you wanted them safe,
you shouldn't have deceived us twice.

00:27:08.918 --> 00:27:11.129 line:85.83%,end
What happened to my colleagues?

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.465 line:85.83%,end
Unfortunately,

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:17.093 line:85.83%,end
everyone was killed
including Professor Han.

00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:19.721 line:85.83%,end
Everyone?

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:23.683 line:85.83%,end
How can I believe you?

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.226 line:85.83%,end
Whether or not you believe me,

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.521 line:85.83%,end
I want to help you.

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:31.566 line:85.83%,end
<i>Give me a bit more time,
and I'll come up with a plan--</i>

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.109 line:85.83%,end
When you tried to kill us,

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.074 line:85.83%,end
had the North approved it?

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.534 line:85.83%,end
Of course not. We had no time for that.

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.246 line:85.83%,end
Remember this.

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:50.877 line:85.83%,end
Once we're convinced we're never
going back alive, we'll blow ourselves up.

00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:54.005 line:85.83%,end
And all the hostages will die too.

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:18.238 line:85.83%,end
<i>You must accomplish
this mission at all costs, okay?</i>

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.534 line:85.83%,end
<i>Those who have power
all thanks to their family name</i>

00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:24.786 line:85.83%,end
<i>are pointing a gun at me.</i>

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:29.207 line:85.83%,end
You're my last weapon
that I can kill them with.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.542 line:85.83%,end
Don't forget that.

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:46.891 line:85.83%,end
Mom…
