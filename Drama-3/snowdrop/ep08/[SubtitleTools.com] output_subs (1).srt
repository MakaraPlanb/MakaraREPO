EPISODE 8

3
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:25,912
Hello?

4
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,164
Yes. And?

5
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:31,542
What? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,295
Eun Yeong-u?

7
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,799
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

8
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:49,977
What? Where is he going?

9
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,902
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

10
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:09,622
You're good at that.

11
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:10,665
Of course.

12
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,716
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,011
I thought you weren't coming today.

14
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:27,265
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

15
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,436
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,773
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

17
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:37,358
to give them some food.

18
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,407
Could you step aside?

19
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:52,456
Step aside?

20
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,264
Or I will for you.

21
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:14,896
Ma'am, this is bad.

22
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:17,023
It's Yeong-u.

23
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,610
What?

24
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,322
My son is?

25
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:25,740
Where's my husband?

26
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,658
He's at the hospital.

27
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,870
That rude wench.

28
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:33,748
Did she just leave without saying bye?

29
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:36,542
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,128
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

31
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:41,214
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

32
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,758
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

33
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:47,803
This way, sir.

34
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,184
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

35
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:01,067
Good work, guys.

36
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:08,616
He's asleep, right?

37
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,076
We gave him a sedative.

38
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,084
Yeong-u.

39
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,753
I shouldn't have let them

40
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,089
assign you to the front lines.

41
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,515
Dad.

42
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,058
Hey.

43
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,186
I…

44
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:40,731
promised Mom…

45
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:43,109
Mom?

46
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:49,156
…that I would protect…

47
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:56,998
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

48
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,667
<i>Mom.</i>

49
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,421
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

50
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,673
So don't worry.

51
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,718
I'll make sure she marries

52
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,970
someone who loves her so much.

53
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:15,808
And I'll look out for her by her side
until she becomes an old lady,

54
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,102
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

55
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,314
I'm just three years younger than you.

56
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:31,490
Dad.

57
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,492
Yes?

58
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,204
Yeong-ro…

59
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,421
Keep her safe.

60
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:47,923
Of course, I will.

61
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:51,427
But you should get better
and do it yourself.

62
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,764
You should do that.

63
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,394
Yeong-u?

64
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,980
Don't fall asleep. Talk to me.

65
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:05,399
Cardiac arrest!

66
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:06,400
What's that sound?

67
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,277
-Move aside!
-Move aside, sir.

68
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,570
Do something!

69
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:12,239
Yeong-u! Don't fall asleep.

70
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,783
Don't fall asleep!

71
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,409
Yeong-u, wake up!

72
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:16,911
Wake him up!

73
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,496
Come on, do something!

74
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,789
Yeong-u, wake up!

75
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,501
Wake him up!

76
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:27,421
Don't fall asleep! Yeong-u!

77
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:38,015
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

78
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,111
This is the Rhine.

79
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,405
This is the Rhine.

80
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,948
VIP, answer me.

81
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,370
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

82
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:50,332
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

83
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,378
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

84
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,631
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

85
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,842
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

86
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:02,011
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

87
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,805
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

88
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:08,809
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

89
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:12,313
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

90
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,691
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

91
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,610
<i>and came to Korea</i>

92
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:20,362
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

93
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:24,241
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

94
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:27,244
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

95
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:48,432
What…

96
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,185
What did she just say?

97
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,399
My brother…

98
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,195
was killed?

99
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,250
My brother is dead?

100
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:26,470
No…

101
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,100
No…

102
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:32,810
No…

103
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,479
It can't be true.

104
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,942
Why… Why is my brother dead?

105
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:40,984
No…

106
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,737
That's not true…

107
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,953
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

108
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:57,126
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

109
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,127
Eun Yeong-ro!

110
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:00,129
Eun Yeong-ro!

111
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,508
-Yeong-ro!
-Yeong-u!

112
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:09,388
Let go! Let go of me!

113
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:11,056
Calm down!

114
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,768
I need to go see for myself!

115
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,482
It's dangerous.
You don't want to die, do you?

116
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,637
You're the leader of those
who killed Yeong-u?

117
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,557
You evil bastard.

118
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,435
Holding us hostage wasn't enough?
Why did you kill my brother?

119
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,187
What did he do wrong?

120
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,481
He didn't do anything to deserve it!

121
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,401
Bring him back.

122
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,904
Bring him back!

123
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,036
DORM ROOM 208

00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:58,205
DORM ROOM 205
DORM ROOM 204

126
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,059
2ND FLOOR LOUNGE

127
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,240
<i>Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.</i>

128
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:35,492
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

129
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,911
<i>After roll-call, in room 207,</i>

130
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:41,456
<i>Yeo Jeong-min, Ko Hye-ryeong,
Yoon Seol-hui, and Eun Yeong-ro</i>

131
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,626
<i>ate</i> ramyeon <i>and chat with Lee Jang-hui
from room 209</i>

132
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,129
<i>and Kim Gang-hui and Lim So-yeon
from room 206.</i>

133
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:50,340
<i>Yeong-ro received a necklace as a gift
from an unnamed man who was</i>

134
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:51,925
<i>her partner at the Open House.</i>

135
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:53,969
<i>They must be seeing each other.</i>

136
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,346
The girl who treated me?

137
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,059
<i>I heard the ANSP director's son is dead.
What if they try to retaliate against us?</i>

138
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,233
<i>Did you forget about the instructions?</i>

139
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,695
But they were given before his death.

140
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,365
<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

141
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,285
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

142
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,162
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

143
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:23,498
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

144
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:28,045
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

145
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:34,885
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

146
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:37,888
<i>A bomb?</i>

147
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:40,682
If they try to deceive us again,

148
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,519
I'll push the button.

149
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:07,853
Talk about bad timing.

150
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,230
If only you'd come in a bit later.

151
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:12,816
Turn around.

152
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,177
That…

153
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,846
Why is that…

154
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,366
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

155
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,994
Don't try anything funny.

156
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,330
Will you blow everyone up?

157
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:12,834
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

158
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,172
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

159
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,427
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

160
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:31,269
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

161
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,313
I won't let it slide twice.

162
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,942
"That woman"? Who?

163
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:42,906
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

164
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,450
Just colleagues.

165
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:02,259
Go in.

166
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,705
How is she?

167
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:34,124
I gave her a tranquilizer,

168
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,793
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

169
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,724
Can we have a word for a minute?

170
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:16,750
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

171
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,501
but we never know

172
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:21,379
how things will turn out and when.

173
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:24,299
You know that, right?

174
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,801
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,678
So the ANSP director's daughter…

176
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:34,100
hid you in this dorm?

177
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:36,770
Yes.

178
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:44,194
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

179
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:50,116
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

180
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,665
I never had any personal feelings for her.

181
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:01,378
I'm relieved to hear that.

182
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,182
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

183
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,142
but the news about it just broke out.

184
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,311
And my face has been disclosed.

185
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:23,108
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

186
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,237
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,241
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

188
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:33,451
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

189
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,996
I just don't trust the ANSP.

190
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,831
As I told you,

191
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,793
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

192
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:44,337
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

193
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:50,093
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

194
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,970
Would the party really have

195
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:55,181
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

196
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,476
Then…

197
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,855
let me ask you one thing.

198
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,070
Why in ten days?

199
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,990
You seriously don't know?

200
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:16,494
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

201
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:57,160
That's a bomb, isn't it?

202
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:01,873
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

203
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,292
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

204
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,337
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

205
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:12,175
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

206
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,677
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

207
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:16,096
Keep it down.

208
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,182
He took her out of here in secret.

209
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:21,309
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:24,479
Get back to sleep.

211
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:27,565
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

212
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:30,193
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

213
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:31,611
I saw it with my own eyes!

214
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:32,821
Gye Bun-ok.

215
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,699
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

216
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,993
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

217
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,579
It's already been two hours.

218
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:44,165
They must've released her. Right?

219
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:45,375
Of course not.

220
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:49,879
She passed out.

221
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:54,217
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

222
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,636
Her brother died?

223
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,513
I feel so bad for her.

224
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:01,266
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

225
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,112
Honey.

226
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,115
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

227
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,118
It's all my fault.

228
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,496
I'm the one who got him killed.

229
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:27,959
That's not your fault.

230
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,879
When you sent him to the front lines,

231
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:34,757
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

232
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,802
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

233
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,971
Very enthusiastically, at that.

234
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:43,558
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

235
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:47,896
Honey.

236
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,483
I know it's really hard for you,

237
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:55,236
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

238
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,407
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

239
00:24:01,117 --> 00:24:03,328
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

240
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:06,623
If Code 1 finds out

241
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:09,334
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

242
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,920
Now that the operation has failed,

243
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:14,005
if you're pushed out,

244
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,215
what about Yeong-ro?

245
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:17,425
We can't bring Yeong-u back,

246
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,719
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

247
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,347
I know you made a deal with the North,

248
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,851
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

249
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,229
Honey!

250
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,774
You must pull yourself together!

251
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,985
I know. I know that.

252
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:37,987
Yeong-u…

253
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:39,864
Yeong-u…

254
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,703
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

255
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:48,623
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

256
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,085
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

257
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:54,170
I'm just three years younger than you.

258
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:03,471
Yeong-u!

259
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,184
Yeong-u!

260
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:11,521
Yeong-u!

261
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:15,483
Yeong-u…

262
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:18,987
Yeong-u!

263
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:24,951
Yeong-u…

264
00:25:25,702 --> 00:25:27,704
Get it together.

265
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:30,957
My brother

266
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,917
is gone.

267
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,005
You must've had a nightmare.

268
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:38,881
Don't you remember

269
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,550
passing out?

270
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:00,028
It's all right.

271
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,029
It's okay.

272
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,198
All right, breathe in again.

273
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,911
It's okay.

274
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,210
<i>Wait.</i>

275
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:22,091
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

276
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:31,768
I'm sorry,

277
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:36,898
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

278
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:43,488
They must be mistaken.

279
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,698
Maybe someone by the same name.

280
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:36,666
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

281
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:40,086
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

282
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,088
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

283
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:46,050
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

284
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:49,512
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

285
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:53,599
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

286
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,019
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

287
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:26,257
Go back to the room.

288
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:34,056
Go back to the room.

289
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,018
Let me go.

290
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,857
Let me out.

291
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:51,491
My brother…

292
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,205
I want to go see my brother.

293
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:03,044
Please.

294
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,922
Please let me see him one last time.

295
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:45,169
Thank you.

296
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:46,754
What? Okay.

297
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:54,011
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

298
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,348
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

299
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:05,481
Be strong.

300
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:11,988
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

301
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:16,409
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

302
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:19,036
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

303
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:22,582
They just lost their child.

304
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,213
Right.

305
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:33,092
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

306
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,096
Yes,

307
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,433
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

308
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:44,812
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

309
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:46,022
-Stop it.
-It's just…

310
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:50,651
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

311
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:52,904
Stay strong.

312
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,333
Let's go.

313
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,799
I can't believe you!

314
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:14,884
I just…

315
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,222
I mean,

316
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:24,769
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

317
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:27,813
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

318
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,483
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

319
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,734
That's enough!

320
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,862
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

321
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:35,947
I mean,

322
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,618
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

323
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:41,994
What a sly snake.

324
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:45,915
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

325
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:50,544
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

326
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:53,339
Wait.

327
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:57,343
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

328
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,267
What do I do with you?

329
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:09,480
Eun's wife caught on quick.

330
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:11,440
You seriously don't know?

331
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,943
What other than the hostage situation?

332
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,531
You'll use the hostage-taking?

333
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,868
But what if something
happens to the students?

334
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:23,869
Do you think--

335
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:27,081
That's not important right now!

336
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:31,585
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

337
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:35,464
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

338
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:37,925
My goodness.

339
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,014
Honey.

340
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:49,311
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,649
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

342
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,027
unless 13 people die,

343
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,779
it'll be all for nothing.

344
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:05,077
What are you talking about?

345
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,209
For Eun to become president,

346
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:16,672
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

347
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:19,633
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

348
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:22,720
He's not just any fortuneteller.

349
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:27,308
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

350
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:31,645
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

351
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:34,774
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

352
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,609
I told you never to talk about it!

353
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:39,487
How many times must I tell you?

354
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,739
Right.

355
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,783
Gosh.

356
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:48,120
I'm sorry, honey.

357
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,083
I forgot.

358
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:58,047
You must want to screw me over.

359
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,840
There's no other explanation.

360
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:01,258
God damn it!

361
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,181
Darn it.

362
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,475
That little sly minx.

363
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:17,942
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

364
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:21,987
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

365
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,157
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

366
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,534
No!

367
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:30,329
You should leave out the protesting part.

368
00:34:31,163 --> 00:34:34,083
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

369
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,961
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

370
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:38,963
I understand, ma'am.

371
00:34:39,964 --> 00:34:44,009
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

372
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:46,637
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>

373
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:51,600
By the way, I should go there
to pay my respects to him.

374
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:54,436
You just focus on preparing
for tomorrow's announcement.

375
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,731
Don't worry. We're even rehearsing it.

376
00:34:58,023 --> 00:34:58,983
Salute!

377
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:06,365
Where were we?

378
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,289
<i>Let's continue.</i>

379
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,584
I'm Gal Sang-sik from JBC.

380
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:19,253
Thank you.

381
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:22,965
The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

382
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:26,218
Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

383
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:28,679
of the opposition candidate for it?

384
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:31,140
I told you.

385
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,144
In Professor Han's bag,

386
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:38,272
we found a letter
from his son in the North

387
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:40,316
that says they should destroy

388
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,109
the pro-US candidate--

389
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:43,068
No!

390
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:46,488
You can't get so worked up.

391
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:47,823
Right.

392
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,201
I should relax.

393
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:51,243
Let me try it again.

394
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:53,078
Are you going to do this all night?

395
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,831
Look.

396
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:59,335
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

397
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,463
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

398
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:04,298
Of course, it must go perfectly!

399
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,177
Guys.

400
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:12,848
What should I wear tomorrow?

401
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:14,099
Pardon?

402
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:40,376
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

403
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:41,080

CAFETERIA

407
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:00,432
Take your time and eat little by little.

408
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:02,434
Here.

409
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,333
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

410
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,464
Or you'll collapse.

411
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:43,934
I think he should be untied to eat this.

412
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,940
-Untie him.
-Okay.

413
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:51,775
Come on.

414
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:57,739
Hey, come eat.

415
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,199
What are you doing?

416
00:39:59,283 --> 00:40:01,910
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

417
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,329
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

418
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,294
This is for you. Come on.

419
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,463
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

420
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:18,051
-Sir.
-Yes?

421
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:20,762
Why don't you eat with me?

422
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:52,628
Did you sleep at all?

423
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:55,756
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

424
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,553
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

425
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,683
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

426
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,269
this wouldn't be happening.

427
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:13,023
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

428
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:14,149
Stop it.

429
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,492
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

430
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,453
but I still don't get why

431
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,622
she stopped us from searching like that.

432
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:31,375
I found that weird too.

433
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,712
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

434
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:37,756
What if he harmed the kids?

435
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,509
She should've been scared
and let you search.

436
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:45,180
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

437
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,019
There are many?

438
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,648
Yes. Once a month,

439
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:58,193
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

440
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:00,362
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:01,363
Just eat.

442
00:42:01,446 --> 00:42:03,907
You said you found it suspicious too.

443
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,493
Suspicious?

444
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,454
Maybe she has no family.

445
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:11,748
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

446
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,375
But once a month,

447
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:18,922
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

448
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,350
<i>All exhausted?</i>

449
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:32,978
Yes. That's not all.

450
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:36,565
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

451
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:37,899
Hey, now.

452
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:39,276
Shut it.

453
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,321
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

454
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:45,115
What on earth did you overhear?

455
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:52,080
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

456
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:54,833
Ms. Pi's picture.

457
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:56,501
Picture?

458
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:03,634
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

459
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:10,724
Put him on right now!

460
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:12,851
Don't you know who I am?

461
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:14,519
I'm still the hall director!

462
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:20,233
Sir.

463
00:43:21,777 --> 00:43:25,447
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

464
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:30,327
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

465
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,704
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

466
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:35,832
Can just anyone be in this position?

467
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:40,504
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

468
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:43,006
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

469
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,635
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

470
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,810
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

471
00:43:55,394 --> 00:43:57,938
My cousin lives in Munich.

472
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:00,691
<i>My goodness.</i>

473
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:04,945
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

474
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:09,074
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

475
00:44:09,157 --> 00:44:11,785
She's not good enough to be my successor.

476
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,041
I'm quitting, but I care.

477
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:21,962
Who the hell asked you to do this?

478
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:26,091
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

479
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:29,970
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

480
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:31,346
Do you understand?

481
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:34,599
Ma'am.

482
00:44:43,525 --> 00:44:45,110
<i>And that night,</i>

483
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,697
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>

484
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,034
Killed herself?

485
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:54,745
Why?

486
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:56,913
How would I know?

487
00:44:56,997 --> 00:45:00,459
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

488
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:03,211
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

489
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:04,963
But why did she

490
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:08,467
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

491
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,220
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

492
00:45:12,304 --> 00:45:13,764
I don't know.

493
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,391
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

494
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:18,810
Anyway,

495
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:22,272
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

496
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:27,986
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

497
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:50,425
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

498
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:56,473
Hey.

499
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,183
Yes?

500
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:59,935
Showing off your drawing skills?

501
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:01,436
Is that it?

502
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,021
Darn it.

503
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:05,857
Add a scar or something.

504
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,235
Right here.

505
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,028
A scar? What for?

506
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:22,415
You drew him well. It's very similar.

507
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:23,542
Thank you.

508
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:26,002
We're not using it to catch him.

509
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:28,088
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

510
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,423
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

511
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:32,592
We need the other guys to look scary

512
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,053
to make them look like bad guys.

513
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,309
What's that?

514
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:45,856
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

515
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:49,109
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

516
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:50,861
That's right.

ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

518
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:01,162
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

519
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:05,375
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethal…

520
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:09,087
Lethal.

521
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:10,839
Lethal.

522
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,344
You don't even knock now?

523
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:24,269
Aren't you worried about the students?

524
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:27,522
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

525
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:30,734
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

526
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:32,444
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

527
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:35,572
Han-na.

528
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,950
Don't go against the flow.

529
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:41,202
We do what we're told

530
00:47:41,912 --> 00:47:44,039
without question. Absolute obedience.

531
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:46,917
The detonator?

532
00:47:48,585 --> 00:47:50,337
The director's daughter is in there.

533
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:53,256
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

534
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,509
What do you mean?

535
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:58,511
It's better for you not to know.

536
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,805
What you don't know won't hurt you.

537
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:02,724
Stop bothering me.

538
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:06,728
Lethal.

539
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:09,648
He's here again.

540
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:15,362
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

541
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:17,405
That bastard.

542
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,827
He's here!

543
00:48:30,794 --> 00:48:33,922
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

544
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:36,299
Before the announcement,

545
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,927
I pray for the souls of

546
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:41,304
the late Eun Yeong-u,

547
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,515
the son of director Eun,

548
00:48:43,598 --> 00:48:46,643
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

549
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:50,772
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

550
00:48:57,112 --> 00:48:58,113
Now,

551
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:02,158
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

552
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:07,872
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

553
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:09,874
came to Korea early this year.

554
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,626
The ANSP

555
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,463
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

556
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:19,175
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

557
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:23,930
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

558
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:29,811
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

559
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:32,731
So we started chasing those two.

560
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:41,114
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

561
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:44,743
Want to dig into it?

562
00:49:44,826 --> 00:49:46,202
A case?

563
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:49,330
What kind of case?

564
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:53,668
Here! Take photos of these.

565
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,424
These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

566
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:04,596
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

567
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,226
The Hosu hostage situation?

568
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:12,771
Without An knowing?

569
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:16,983
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

570
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:18,359
Take it!

571
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,491
We won't give in

572
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:27,702
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

573
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:29,621
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

574
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:34,000
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

575
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:37,337
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

576
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,464
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

577
00:50:39,547 --> 00:50:42,759
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

578
00:50:44,928 --> 00:50:48,348
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

579
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:52,268
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

580
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:54,562
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

581
00:50:54,646 --> 00:50:58,775
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

582
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:01,694
What about ten days later?

583
00:51:03,238 --> 00:51:05,657
They just created four more spies.

584
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,910
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

585
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,208
Release half of the hostages.

586
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:17,752
Pardon?

587
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:20,088
If 30 hostages get released

588
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:22,841
and say there are only three spies,

589
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:24,592
won't that be fun to watch?

590
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,972
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

591
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:35,186
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

592
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,397
Is there anyone you want to release?

593
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:51,327
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

594
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,739
We don't intend to hurt you.

595
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:31,284
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

596
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:33,661
To prove that, I will

597
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:37,290
release 30 of you today.

598
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:41,502
Quiet!

599
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:46,174
Ms. Pi.

600
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:48,801
This is the list of those I'll release.

601
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:50,762
Call their names.

602
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:57,602
Yeong-ro.

603
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,937
I think they'll release you.

604
00:52:59,604 --> 00:53:01,397
I hope they'll release us too.

605
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,024
Please.

606
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,237
Je Min-gyeong.

607
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:09,489
Finally!

608
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:10,865
Kim Bit-ni.

609
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:12,158
-Hey!
-Me?

610
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:13,785
Yang Hye-ji.

611
00:53:15,245 --> 00:53:16,579
Kim Dong-hui.

612
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:19,499
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

613
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:22,418
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

614
00:53:23,878 --> 00:53:25,546
30 people right away?

615
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,798
What?

616
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,549
You don't want them?

617
00:53:29,884 --> 00:53:33,054
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

618
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:36,391
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

619
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,894
In return, send in things we demand.

620
00:53:39,978 --> 00:53:41,062
Hey, wait!

621
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:44,232
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

622
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:46,818
We'll send in anything you need.

623
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:48,861
And

624
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:51,030
Dr. Kang…

625
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,575
Release her right now.

626
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:57,829
She won't be released.

627
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:01,082
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

628
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,168
What? A gun?

629
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:06,713
You…

630
00:54:06,796 --> 00:54:09,465
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

631
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:13,678
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

632
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:17,390
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

633
00:54:22,854 --> 00:54:24,397
Some cup noodles too.

634
00:54:31,362 --> 00:54:32,655
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

635
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:37,618
Hello?

636
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:41,331
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

637
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:42,332
Cup noodles.

638
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,002
But what kind of cup noodles?

639
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:03,603
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

640
00:55:04,187 --> 00:55:07,398
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

641
00:55:07,815 --> 00:55:10,443
How could we not be included in those 30?

642
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:12,862
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

643
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,698
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

644
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:19,243
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

645
00:55:21,496 --> 00:55:22,663
Yeong-ro.

646
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:27,001
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

647
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:32,799
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

648
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:35,968
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

649
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:38,304
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

650
00:55:38,888 --> 00:55:40,264
but she's quite eloquent.

651
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:43,393
You guys obviously don't know her well.

652
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:46,354
Hey. Dream on.

653
00:55:47,772 --> 00:55:48,689
Bun-ok.

654
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:53,111
Go bring some water.

655
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:55,863
Hot water.

656
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:03,162
You.

657
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:05,915
Stay put.

658
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,544
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

659
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:12,296
You little…

660
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:23,933
Don't take long!

661
00:57:18,362 --> 00:57:20,990
Hold on. What's that?

662
00:57:25,036 --> 00:57:26,204
Oh, my.

663
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:28,372
What's all this?

664
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:30,625
I knew it.

665
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,460
There's always a silver lining.

666
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:35,129
What are you doing?

667
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:50,269
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

668
00:57:50,353 --> 00:57:52,688
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

669
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:54,440
How can I ignore this?

670
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:57,693
How will they know who took it?

671
00:57:57,777 --> 00:57:59,654
I'll just play dumb.

672
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,030
Darn it.

673
00:58:03,324 --> 00:58:04,408
Of course, they'll know.

674
00:58:04,992 --> 00:58:07,537
Because I'll tell them you took it.

675
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:10,081
Bun-ok.

676
00:58:10,164 --> 00:58:12,208
How could you say that?

677
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:16,629
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

678
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:20,341
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

679
00:58:29,892 --> 00:58:31,561
Damn it. Don't come near me.

680
00:58:31,644 --> 00:58:32,812
Stay away.

681
00:58:34,522 --> 00:58:35,523
Darn it.

682
00:58:57,503 --> 00:58:59,547
I told you!

683
00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:02,842
I told you not to do this.

684
00:59:02,925 --> 00:59:06,304
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

685
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:12,518
That wench talked me into it.

686
00:59:12,852 --> 00:59:16,230
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

687
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:22,320
I didn't.

688
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:25,239
I really didn't.

689
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,874
That damn bastard.

690
00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:39,128
I'm so sorry.

691
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:44,008
Sang-beom.

692
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:46,052
What happened to your face?

693
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:51,557
Please, sir.

694
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:06,656
Sang-beom.

695
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:54,662
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

696
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,920
Please, sir.

697
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:05,131
Sir.

698
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:08,259
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

699
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:11,262
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

700
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:16,559
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

701
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:17,852
Come here, you fool.

702
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:21,397
Sang-beom!

703
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:23,149
Sang-beom!

704
01:01:23,232 --> 01:01:24,692
How dare you!

705
01:01:26,527 --> 01:01:28,779
Please, sir! Are you okay?

706
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:35,327
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

707
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:36,370
I'm so sorry.

708
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:41,125
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

709
01:01:44,795 --> 01:01:47,506
Please don't kill them! Please!

710
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:51,135
Why are you doing this to us?

711
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:55,097
Please don't kill them! Please!

712
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:56,307
You bastard!

713
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,351
Stop it, you s***!

714
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:01,270
Stop it!

715
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,024
You can't do that to an old man!

716
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:11,155
Go ahead. Shoot me!

717
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:12,615
Shoot me, you bastard!

718
01:02:12,698 --> 01:02:13,532
Comrade Joo!

719
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:14,575
Go ahead.

720
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:16,744
Shoot. Shoot me!

721
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,708
Shoot me, you bastard!

722
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:23,751
Comrade Joo!

723
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:33,219
Damn it!

724
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:48,234
He tried to steal our money--

725
01:02:48,317 --> 01:02:50,361
Lock the three in the prayer room.

726
01:03:07,586 --> 01:03:08,546
That hurts.

727
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:26,981
You idiot!

728
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:30,150
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

729
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,695
What on earth did you do this time?

730
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:33,654
Shut up.

731
01:03:34,947 --> 01:03:36,949
It's all your fault

732
01:03:38,242 --> 01:03:39,660
I turned out this way.

733
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:40,661
What?

734
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,125
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

735
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:47,960
There are just three of them.

736
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:49,795
Can't they just snipe at them?

737
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:53,591
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

738
01:03:55,426 --> 01:03:58,470
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

739
01:03:58,554 --> 01:03:59,972
Stop it, you idiot!

740
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:02,808
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

741
01:04:06,645 --> 01:04:07,771
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
01:04:07,855 --> 01:04:09,690
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

743
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:12,109
Untie me too. Untie me first!

744
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:14,320
Listen, sir.

745
01:04:14,403 --> 01:04:17,031
I'll tell you a way out of here,

746
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:18,574
so take him with you.

747
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,368
A way out of here?

748
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:23,495
Is there a way out?

749
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,084
Come on.

750
01:04:30,085 --> 01:04:31,045
This way.

751
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,549
Here. This is the one.

752
01:04:38,135 --> 01:04:41,263
Where does this lead?

753
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:43,390
If you go all the way down the stairs,

754
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,560
you'll find the exit on basement two.

755
01:05:06,747 --> 01:05:08,457
Just keep working.

756
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:15,422
Hey! You did such a good job!

757
01:05:15,506 --> 01:05:18,467
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

758
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,843
I'm flattered.

759
01:05:22,763 --> 01:05:24,598
These are things they're demanding.

760
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:26,266
Get them ready

761
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:30,104
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

762
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:32,940
You mean Jang Han-na?

763
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:36,276
But she's enraged right now.

764
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,237
How about we send another agent?

765
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,947
That bastard said it must be her.

766
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:43,283
He specifically told me to send her.

767
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:47,287
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

768
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:48,747
Understood, sir.

769
01:05:49,915 --> 01:05:53,335
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

770
01:05:53,419 --> 01:05:55,629
things have been going smoothly.

771
01:05:57,923 --> 01:05:59,008
That goes without saying.

772
01:06:00,426 --> 01:06:01,343
Now,

773
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:06,223
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

774
01:06:07,057 --> 01:06:09,059
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

775
01:06:10,853 --> 01:06:11,729
Do you mean me?

776
01:06:15,899 --> 01:06:17,067
Right away.

777
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,324
This is so nice.

778
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,410
It really is.

779
01:07:01,403 --> 01:07:04,281
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

780
01:07:06,408 --> 01:07:09,745
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

781
01:07:09,828 --> 01:07:12,581
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:16,710
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

783
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:19,046
I'll turn my life around here!

784
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:21,423
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

785
01:07:21,507 --> 01:07:22,841
Tell me how you will.

786
01:07:24,343 --> 01:07:26,345
You don't need to know.

787
01:07:26,428 --> 01:07:27,930
Just get out of here alone.

788
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,517
How can I possibly leave without you?

789
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,019
God, this is driving me crazy.

790
01:07:34,103 --> 01:07:37,606
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

791
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:40,109
So stop getting in my way

792
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:41,985
and just go!

793
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,866
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

794
01:08:28,073 --> 01:08:31,410
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

795
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,288
SWAT team, follow me!

796
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:38,041
A situation occurred.

797
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:42,004
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

798
01:08:48,218 --> 01:08:49,720
Make him go back in right now.

799
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:52,222
Make him go back in! At all cost!

800
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,816
Follow me now!

801
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:09,573
We received an order. Go back in.

802
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:12,868
Who the hell gave such an order?

803
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:21,835
The exit.

804
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:27,382
You crazy bastards!

805
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,349
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

806
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,605
Go back in. It's an order.

807
01:09:46,693 --> 01:09:47,986
Go back in!

808
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:50,150
Sir, please.

809
01:11:51,234 --> 01:11:52,611
Please, sir.

810
01:11:52,694 --> 01:11:54,404
Please don't kill him.

811
01:11:56,907 --> 01:11:58,533
How did that bastard get out?

812
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,080
I'll tell you.

813
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:05,457
He got out through here. This way.

814
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:14,299
Here.

815
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:54,339
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

816
01:12:55,674 --> 01:12:56,883
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

817
01:12:57,426 --> 01:13:01,012
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

818
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:02,597
The doctor?

819
01:13:03,598 --> 01:13:06,726
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

820
01:13:08,854 --> 01:13:10,564
Does it have to do with it?

821
01:13:13,442 --> 01:13:15,777
For the ruling party to regain power,

822
01:13:16,403 --> 01:13:19,114
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

823
01:13:19,197 --> 01:13:22,200
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

824
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:24,786
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

825
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:33,378
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

826
01:13:35,297 --> 01:13:36,756
It's taken me

827
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,468
as many as 17 years to come this far.

828
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:43,138
Only a handful of people

829
01:13:44,347 --> 01:13:47,058
know who I really am, even in the North.

830
01:13:48,351 --> 01:13:52,230
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

831
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:55,066
proves how much you mean to the party.

832
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:56,693
Can't you see that?

833
01:14:02,741 --> 01:14:03,909
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

834
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:05,660
The doctor is what?

835
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:08,705
The doctor the agency sent in…

836
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,958
is a Northern spy?

837
01:14:24,638 --> 01:14:26,848
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

838
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:32,229
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

839
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:40,445
And this hostage-taking too?

840
01:15:03,885 --> 01:15:05,595
Go back to your seats!

841
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:08,223
What was the gunfire about?

842
01:15:09,307 --> 01:15:10,642
You want us to all die?

843
01:15:11,226 --> 01:15:15,230
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

844
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,942
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

845
01:15:19,025 --> 01:15:21,194
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

846
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:23,572
You made him come back in?

847
01:15:24,614 --> 01:15:25,490
Why?

848
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:26,950
Why do you think?

849
01:15:27,576 --> 01:15:30,954
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

850
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:34,291
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

851
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:36,209
He'll be a pain in the neck.

852
01:15:36,793 --> 01:15:39,379
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

853
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:41,506
the ANSP director's son of all people?

854
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:45,468
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

855
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:50,265
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

856
01:15:57,772 --> 01:16:00,942
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

857
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,862
Hold out for nine more days,

858
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:06,781
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

859
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:34,017
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

860
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:36,811
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

861
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:39,689
<i>to the North?</i>

862
01:16:41,983 --> 01:16:44,861
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

863
01:16:46,237 --> 01:16:48,531
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>

864
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:51,409
<i>Then…</i>

865
01:16:52,994 --> 01:16:55,705
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

866
01:16:57,457 --> 01:16:59,000
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

867
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:26,755
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

868
01:18:32,469 --> 01:18:34,554
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

869
01:18:37,974 --> 01:18:39,058
Don't do anything.

870
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:40,810
You bastard.

871
01:18:41,895 --> 01:18:43,313
Don't you dare touch her!

872
01:18:48,818 --> 01:18:51,279
You think you can get out of here alive?

873
01:18:52,113 --> 01:18:55,575
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

874
01:18:56,075 --> 01:19:00,538
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

875
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:04,417
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

876
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:09,380
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

877
01:19:10,089 --> 01:19:13,593
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

878
01:19:14,552 --> 01:19:16,387
Of course, the latter would be better.

879
01:19:16,471 --> 01:19:19,224
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

880
01:19:20,934 --> 01:19:24,604
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

881
01:19:25,855 --> 01:19:27,357
You think that makes sense?

882
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:33,530
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

883
01:19:34,489 --> 01:19:37,283
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

884
01:19:39,285 --> 01:19:41,996
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

885
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:45,333
But my country is different.

886
01:19:47,418 --> 01:19:48,253
What?

887
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:51,256
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

888
01:19:52,882 --> 01:19:55,260
The party considers the people
as its children.

889
01:19:56,261 --> 01:19:57,971
They'd never abandon us.

890
01:20:01,224 --> 01:20:02,392
Look.

891
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,645
Wake up, will you?

892
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:07,730
You still don't get it.

893
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:10,149
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

894
01:20:10,692 --> 01:20:14,362
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

895
01:20:22,829 --> 01:20:25,373
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

896
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,252
I'll gladly be one.

897
01:20:37,635 --> 01:20:40,555
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

898
01:20:40,638 --> 01:20:42,265
in the dorm you can see,

899
01:20:42,348 --> 01:20:44,559
64 hostages, including female students,

900
01:20:44,642 --> 01:20:47,937
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

901
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:50,148
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

902
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:52,150
people fear for their safety.

903
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:09,876
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

904
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:11,169
<i>this is</i>

905
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,256
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

906
01:21:18,301 --> 01:21:19,636
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

907
01:21:20,887 --> 01:21:22,764
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

908
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:25,433
<i>to use and throw away.</i>

909
01:22:10,603 --> 01:22:12,605
Why aren't they rescuing us?

910
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:14,899
Why aren't they trying anything?

911
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:17,610
You are

912
01:22:19,028 --> 01:22:20,697
the director's daughter, right?

913
01:22:22,156 --> 01:22:25,243
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

914
01:22:26,285 --> 01:22:27,704
What do I need to do?

915
01:22:27,787 --> 01:22:29,664
Help me. Please.

916
01:22:35,586 --> 01:22:37,255
Don't act rashly.

917
01:22:38,965 --> 01:22:41,092
He has a detonator in his pocket.

918
01:22:41,676 --> 01:22:43,219
If he pushes the button,

919
01:22:45,013 --> 01:22:46,889
the whole dorm will explode.

920
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:55,231
I know it's hard, but be patient.

921
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:57,734
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

922
01:23:00,278 --> 01:23:01,821
I just wanted to give him bread.

923
01:23:12,707 --> 01:23:13,541
I need

924
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,626
to go to the restroom.

925
01:23:16,461 --> 01:23:17,962
Can I go?

926
01:23:32,852 --> 01:23:34,020
Make it quick.

927
01:23:41,611 --> 01:23:43,946
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

928
01:23:45,782 --> 01:23:48,951
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

929
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:18,648
Please

930
01:24:20,066 --> 01:24:21,400
let me rest a bit.

931
01:24:28,116 --> 01:24:29,158
Follow me.

932
01:24:40,962 --> 01:24:42,672
You didn't answer my question.

933
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:49,303
That paper airplane…

934
01:24:51,055 --> 01:24:53,099
That's the one I flew out.

935
01:24:55,685 --> 01:24:57,103
Why do you have it?

936
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:03,860
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

937
01:25:07,405 --> 01:25:09,323
I just found it while being chased.

938
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:11,450
Get some rest here.

939
01:25:14,078 --> 01:25:15,329
Then why did you come back?

940
01:25:17,832 --> 01:25:19,250
You should've just left.

941
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:22,670
Why did you come back here?

942
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:36,309
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

943
01:25:38,811 --> 01:25:42,148
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

944
01:25:45,943 --> 01:25:47,445
I would never have gone in.

945
01:25:57,955 --> 01:25:59,081
I'm sorry…

946
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:03,294
about your brother.

947
01:26:14,096 --> 01:26:15,097
We will

948
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:18,184
leave in nine days.

949
01:26:21,103 --> 01:26:22,980
All this will be over in nine days.

950
01:26:25,316 --> 01:26:27,985
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

951
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:31,072
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

952
01:26:32,823 --> 01:26:34,325
I want to

953
01:26:36,744 --> 01:26:38,454
release you right now.

954
01:26:44,585 --> 01:26:46,087
But I can't.

955
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:18,536
No. Don't go.

956
01:28:49,752 --> 01:28:50,920
If this button is pushed,

957
01:28:52,671 --> 01:28:54,632
the dorm will explode.

958
01:28:56,008 --> 01:28:57,218
Right?

959
01:29:10,064 --> 01:29:11,148
Eun Yeong-ro!

960
01:29:11,732 --> 01:29:14,985
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

961
01:29:15,069 --> 01:29:17,863
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

962
01:29:17,947 --> 01:29:19,198
You really think so?

963
01:29:19,281 --> 01:29:21,700
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

964
01:29:21,784 --> 01:29:24,161
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

965
01:29:24,245 --> 01:29:26,288
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

966
01:29:26,372 --> 01:29:30,167
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

967
01:29:30,251 --> 01:29:32,378
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

968
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:33,879
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

969
01:29:33,963 --> 01:29:36,549
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

970
01:29:36,632 --> 01:29:38,300
planning to kill the students, are they?

971
01:29:38,384 --> 01:29:41,429
Let's save the students together.

972
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,181
How about you use me?

973
01:29:44,265 --> 01:29:47,309
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

974
01:29:47,393 --> 01:29:50,187
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

975
01:29:50,271 --> 01:29:51,397
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

976
01:29:53,566 --> 01:29:56,819
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

977
01:30:02,616 --> 01:30:05,411
BONUS

978
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:11,375
Yeong-ro, close the door.

979
01:30:11,459 --> 01:30:13,127
Pi might smell it and wake up.

980
01:30:19,592 --> 01:30:21,343
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

981
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:23,512
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

982
01:30:23,596 --> 01:30:25,055
Fine. Hurry up.

983
01:30:27,516 --> 01:30:30,186
Hey, your partner is really hot.

984
01:30:30,853 --> 01:30:32,146
Set me up with his friend.

985
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:33,981
Yes. Set me up too.

986
01:30:34,064 --> 01:30:36,734
-Please?
-Please?

987
01:30:37,568 --> 01:30:40,488
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

988
01:30:40,571 --> 01:30:42,364
-Great!
-Great!

989
01:30:43,282 --> 01:30:45,701
His friends? He's being chased--

990
01:30:54,251 --> 01:30:55,669
I haven't seen that necklace before.

991
01:30:57,963 --> 01:30:59,840
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

992
01:31:04,845 --> 01:31:06,847
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

993
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:08,641
Good for you!

994
01:31:10,142 --> 01:31:11,602
That's pretty. What bird is it?

995
01:31:12,436 --> 01:31:13,646
A dove.

996
01:31:14,313 --> 01:31:16,106
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.

997
