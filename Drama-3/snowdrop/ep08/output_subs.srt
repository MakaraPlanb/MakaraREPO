EPISODE 8

3
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,912
Hello?

4
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,164
Yes. And?

5
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,542
What? What are you talking about?

6
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,295
Eun Yeong-u?

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,799
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

8
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,977
What? Where is he going?

9
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,902
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

10
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,622
You're good at that.

11
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,665
Of course.

12
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,716
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,011
I thought you weren't coming today.

14
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,265
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

15
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,436
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,773
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

17
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,358
to give them some food.

18
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,407
Could you step aside?

19
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,456
Step aside?

20
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,264
Or I will for you.

21
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,896
Ma'am, this is bad.

22
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,023
It's Yeong-u.

23
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,610
What?

24
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,322
My son is?

25
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,740
Where's my husband?

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,658
He's at the hospital.

27
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,870
That rude wench.

28
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,748
Did she just leave without saying bye?

29
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,542
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,128
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

31
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

32
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,758
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

33
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,803
This way, sir.

34
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,184
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

35
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,067
Good work, guys.

36
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,616
He's asleep, right?

37
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,076
We gave him a sedative.

38
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,084
Yeong-u.

39
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,753
I shouldn't have let them

40
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,089
assign you to the front lines.

41
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,515
Dad.

42
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,058
Hey.

43
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,186
I…

44
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
promised Mom…

45
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,109
Mom?

46
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,156
…that I would protect…

47
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:49,998
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,667
<i>Mom.</i>

49
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,421
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

50
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
So don't worry.

51
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,718
I'll make sure she marries

52
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,970
someone who loves her so much.

53
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,808
And I'll look out for her by her side
until she becomes an old lady,

54
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,102
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

55
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,314
I'm just three years younger than you.

56
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,490
Dad.

57
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,492
Yes?

58
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,204
Yeong-ro…

59
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,421
Keep her safe.

60
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,923
Of course, I will.

61
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,427
But you should get better
and do it yourself.

62
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,764
You should do that.

63
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,394
Yeong-u?

64
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,980
Don't fall asleep. Talk to me.

65
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,399
Cardiac arrest!

66
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,400
What's that sound?

67
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,277
-Move aside!
-Move aside, sir.

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,570
Do something!

69
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,239
Yeong-u! Don't fall asleep.

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,783
Don't fall asleep!

71
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,409
Yeong-u, wake up!

72
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,911
Wake him up!

73
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,496
Come on, do something!

74
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,789
Yeong-u, wake up!

75
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,501
Wake him up!

76
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,421
Don't fall asleep! Yeong-u!

77
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,015
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

78
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,111
This is the Rhine.

79
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,405
This is the Rhine.

80
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,948
VIP, answer me.

81
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

82
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:43,332
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

83
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

84
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,631
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

85
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

86
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,011
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

87
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,805
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

88
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,809
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

89
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,313
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

90
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

91
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
<i>and came to Korea</i>

92
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,362
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

93
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

94
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,244
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

95
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,432
What…

96
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,185
What did she just say?

97
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,399
My brother…

98
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,195
was killed?

99
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,250
My brother is dead?

100
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,470
No…

101
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,100
No…

102
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,810
No…

103
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,479
It can't be true.

104
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,942
Why… Why is my brother dead?

105
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,984
No…

106
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,737
That's not true…

107
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,953
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

108
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,126
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

109
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,127
Eun Yeong-ro!

110
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,129
Eun Yeong-ro!

111
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,508
-Yeong-ro!
-Yeong-u!

112
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,388
Let go! Let go of me!

113
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,056
Calm down!

114
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,768
I need to go see for myself!

115
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,482
It's dangerous.
You don't want to die, do you?

116
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,637
You're the leader of those
who killed Yeong-u?

117
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,557
You evil bastard.

118
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,435
Holding us hostage wasn't enough?
Why did you kill my brother?

119
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,187
What did he do wrong?

120
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,481
He didn't do anything to deserve it!

121
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,401
Bring him back.

122
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,904
Bring him back!

123
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,036
DORM ROOM 208

00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,205
DORM ROOM 205
DORM ROOM 204

126
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,059
2ND FLOOR LOUNGE

127
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,240
<i>Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.</i>

128
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,492
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

129
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,911
<i>After roll-call, in room 207,</i>

130
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,456
<i>Yeo Jeong-min, Ko Hye-ryeong,
Yoon Seol-hui, and Eun Yeong-ro</i>

131
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,626
<i>ate</i> ramyeon <i>and chat with Lee Jang-hui
from room 209</i>

132
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,129
<i>and Kim Gang-hui and Lim So-yeon
from room 206.</i>

133
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,340
<i>Yeong-ro received a necklace as a gift
from an unnamed man who was</i>

134
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,925
<i>her partner at the Open House.</i>

135
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,969
<i>They must be seeing each other.</i>

136
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,346
The girl who treated me?

137
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,059
<i>I heard the ANSP director's son is dead.
What if they try to retaliate against us?</i>

138
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,233
<i>Did you forget about the instructions?</i>

139
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,695
But they were given before his death.

140
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,365
<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

141
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,285
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

142
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

143
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

144
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

145
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,885
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

146
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,888
<i>A bomb?</i>

147
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,682
If they try to deceive us again,

148
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,519
I'll push the button.

149
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,853
Talk about bad timing.

150
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,230
If only you'd come in a bit later.

151
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,816
Turn around.

152
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,177
That…

153
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,846
Why is that…

154
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,366
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

155
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,994
Don't try anything funny.

156
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
Will you blow everyone up?

157
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,834
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

158
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,172
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

159
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,427
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

160
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,269
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

161
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,313
I won't let it slide twice.

162
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,942
"That woman"? Who?

163
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,906
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

164
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,450
Just colleagues.

165
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,259
Go in.

166
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,705
How is she?

167
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,124
I gave her a tranquilizer,

168
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,793
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

169
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
Can we have a word for a minute?

170
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

171
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,501
but we never know

172
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,379
how things will turn out and when.

173
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,299
You know that, right?

174
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,801
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,678
So the ANSP director's daughter…

176
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,100
hid you in this dorm?

177
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,770
Yes.

178
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,194
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

179
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,116
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

180
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,665
I never had any personal feelings for her.

181
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,378
I'm relieved to hear that.

182
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,182
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

183
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,142
but the news about it just broke out.

184
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,311
And my face has been disclosed.

185
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,108
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

186
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,237
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,241
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

188
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,451
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

189
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,996
I just don't trust the ANSP.

190
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,831
As I told you,

191
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,793
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

192
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,337
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

193
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,093
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

194
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,970
Would the party really have

195
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,181
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

196
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,476
Then…

197
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,855
let me ask you one thing.

198
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,070
Why in ten days?

199
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,990
You seriously don't know?

200
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,494
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

201
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,160
That's a bomb, isn't it?

202
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,873
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

203
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,292
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

204
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,337
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

205
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,175
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

206
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,677
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

207
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,096
Keep it down.

208
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,182
He took her out of here in secret.

209
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,309
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,479
Get back to sleep.

211
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,565
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

212
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,193
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

213
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,611
I saw it with my own eyes!

214
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,821
Gye Bun-ok.

215
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,699
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

216
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,993
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

217
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,579
It's already been two hours.

218
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,165
They must've released her. Right?

219
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,375
Of course not.

220
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,879
She passed out.

221
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,217
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

222
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,636
Her brother died?

223
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,513
I feel so bad for her.

224
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,266
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

225
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,112
Honey.

226
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,115
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

227
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,118
It's all my fault.

228
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,496
I'm the one who got him killed.

229
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,959
That's not your fault.

230
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,879
When you sent him to the front lines,

231
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,757
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

232
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,802
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

233
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,971
Very enthusiastically, at that.

234
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,558
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

235
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,896
Honey.

236
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,483
I know it's really hard for you,

237
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,236
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

238
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,407
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

239
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,328
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

240
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,623
If Code 1 finds out

241
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,334
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

242
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,920
Now that the operation has failed,

243
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,005
if you're pushed out,

244
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,215
what about Yeong-ro?

245
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,425
We can't bring Yeong-u back,

246
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,719
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

247
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,347
I know you made a deal with the North,

248
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,851
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

249
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,229
Honey!

250
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,774
You must pull yourself together!

251
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,985
I know. I know that.

252
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,987
Yeong-u…

253
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,864
Yeong-u…

254
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,703
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

255
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,623
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

256
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,085
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

257
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,170
I'm just three years younger than you.

258
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,471
Yeong-u!

259
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,184
Yeong-u!

260
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,521
Yeong-u!

261
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,483
Yeong-u…

262
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,987
Yeong-u!

263
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,951
Yeong-u…

264
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,704
Get it together.

265
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,957
My brother

266
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,917
is gone.

267
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,005
You must've had a nightmare.

268
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,881
Don't you remember

269
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,550
passing out?

270
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,028
It's all right.

271
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,029
It's okay.

272
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,198
All right, breathe in again.

273
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,911
It's okay.

274
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,210
<i>Wait.</i>

275
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:15,091
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

276
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,768
I'm sorry,

277
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,898
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

278
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,488
They must be mistaken.

279
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,698
Maybe someone by the same name.

280
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,666
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

281
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,086
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

282
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,088
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

283
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:39,050
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

284
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,512
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

285
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,599
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

286
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,019
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

287
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,257
Go back to the room.

288
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,056
Go back to the room.

289
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,018
Let me go.

290
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,857
Let me out.

291
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,491
My brother…

292
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,205
I want to go see my brother.

293
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,044
Please.

294
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,922
Please let me see him one last time.

295
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,169
Thank you.

296
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,754
What? Okay.

297
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,011
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

298
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,348
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

299
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,481
Be strong.

300
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,988
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

301
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,409
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

302
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,036
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

303
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,582
They just lost their child.

304
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,213
Right.

305
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,092
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

306
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,096
Yes,

307
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,433
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

308
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:37,812
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

309
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,022
-Stop it.
-It's just…

310
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,651
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

311
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,904
Stay strong.

312
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,333
Let's go.

313
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,799
I can't believe you!

314
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
I just…

315
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,222
I mean,

316
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:17,769
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

317
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,813
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

318
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,483
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

319
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,734
That's enough!

320
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,862
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

321
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,947
I mean,

322
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,618
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

323
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,994
What a sly snake.

324
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,915
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

325
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,544
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

326
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,339
Wait.

327
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,343
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

328
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,267
What do I do with you?

329
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,480
Eun's wife caught on quick.

330
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,440
You seriously don't know?

331
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,943
What other than the hostage situation?

332
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,531
You'll use the hostage-taking?

333
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,868
But what if something
happens to the students?

334
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,869
Do you think--

335
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,081
That's not important right now!

336
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,585
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

337
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,464
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

338
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,925
My goodness.

339
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,014
Honey.

340
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,311
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,649
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

342
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,027
unless 13 people die,

343
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,779
it'll be all for nothing.

344
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,077
What are you talking about?

345
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,209
For Eun to become president,

346
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,672
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

347
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,633
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

348
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,720
He's not just any fortuneteller.

349
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,308
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

350
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,645
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

351
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,774
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

352
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,609
I told you never to talk about it!

353
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,487
How many times must I tell you?

354
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,739
Right.

355
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,783
Gosh.

356
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,120
I'm sorry, honey.

357
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,083
I forgot.

358
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,047
You must want to screw me over.

359
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,840
There's no other explanation.

360
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,258
God damn it!

361
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,181
Darn it.

362
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,475
That little sly minx.

363
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,942
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

364
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,987
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

365
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,157
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

366
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,534
No!

367
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,329
You should leave out the protesting part.

368
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,083
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

369
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,961
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

370
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,963
I understand, ma'am.

371
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,009
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

372
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,637
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>

373
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,600
By the way, I should go there
to pay my respects to him.

374
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,436
You just focus on preparing
for tomorrow's announcement.

375
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,731
Don't worry. We're even rehearsing it.

376
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,983
Salute!

377
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,365
Where were we?

378
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,289
<i>Let's continue.</i>

379
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,584
I'm Gal Sang-sik from JBC.

380
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,253
Thank you.

381
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,965
The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

382
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,218
Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

383
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,679
of the opposition candidate for it?

384
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,140
I told you.

385
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,144
In Professor Han's bag,

386
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,272
we found a letter
from his son in the North

387
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,316
that says they should destroy

388
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,109
the pro-US candidate--

389
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,068
No!

390
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,488
You can't get so worked up.

391
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,823
Right.

392
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,201
I should relax.

393
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,243
Let me try it again.

394
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,078
Are you going to do this all night?

395
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,831
Look.

396
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,335
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

397
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,463
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

398
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,298
Of course, it must go perfectly!

399
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,177
Guys.

400
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,848
What should I wear tomorrow?

401
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,099
Pardon?

402
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,376
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

403
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,080

CAFETERIA

407
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,432
Take your time and eat little by little.

408
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,434
Here.

409
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,333
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

410
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,464
Or you'll collapse.

411
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,934
I think he should be untied to eat this.

412
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,940
-Untie him.
-Okay.

413
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,775
Come on.

414
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,739
Hey, come eat.

415
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,199
What are you doing?

416
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,910
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

417
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,329
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

418
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,294
This is for you. Come on.

419
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,463
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

420
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,051
-Sir.
-Yes?

421
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,762
Why don't you eat with me?

422
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,628
Did you sleep at all?

423
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,756
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

424
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,553
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

425
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,683
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

426
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,269
this wouldn't be happening.

427
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,023
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

428
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,149
Stop it.

429
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,492
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

430
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,453
but I still don't get why

431
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,622
she stopped us from searching like that.

432
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,375
I found that weird too.

433
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,712
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

434
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,756
What if he harmed the kids?

435
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,509
She should've been scared
and let you search.

436
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,180
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

437
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,019
There are many?

438
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,648
Yes. Once a month,

439
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,193
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

440
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,362
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,363
Just eat.

442
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,907
You said you found it suspicious too.

443
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,493
Suspicious?

444
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,454
Maybe she has no family.

445
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,748
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

446
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,375
But once a month,

447
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:11,922
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

448
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,350
<i>All exhausted?</i>

449
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,978
Yes. That's not all.

450
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,565
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

451
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,899
Hey, now.

452
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,276
Shut it.

453
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,321
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

454
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,115
What on earth did you overhear?

455
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,080
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

456
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,833
Ms. Pi's picture.

457
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,501
Picture?

458
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,634
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

459
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,724
Put him on right now!

460
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,851
Don't you know who I am?

461
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,519
I'm still the hall director!

462
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,233
Sir.

463
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,447
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

464
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,327
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

465
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,704
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

466
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,832
Can just anyone be in this position?

467
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,504
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

468
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,006
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

469
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,635
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

470
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,810
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

471
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,938
My cousin lives in Munich.

472
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,691
<i>My goodness.</i>

473
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,945
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

474
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,074
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

475
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,785
She's not good enough to be my successor.

476
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,041
I'm quitting, but I care.

477
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,962
Who the hell asked you to do this?

478
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,091
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

479
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,970
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

480
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,346
Do you understand?

481
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,599
Ma'am.

482
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,110
<i>And that night,</i>

483
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,697
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>

484
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,034
Killed herself?

485
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,745
Why?

486
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,913
How would I know?

487
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,459
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

488
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,211
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

489
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,963
But why did she

490
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,467
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

491
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,220
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

492
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,764
I don't know.

493
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,391
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

494
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,810
Anyway,

495
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,272
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

496
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:20,986
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

497
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:43,425
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

498
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,473
Hey.

499
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,183
Yes?

500
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,935
Showing off your drawing skills?

501
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,436
Is that it?

502
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,021
Darn it.

503
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,857
Add a scar or something.

504
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,235
Right here.

505
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,028
A scar? What for?

506
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:15,415
You drew him well. It's very similar.

507
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
Thank you.

508
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,002
We're not using it to catch him.

509
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,088
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

510
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,423
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

511
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,592
We need the other guys to look scary

512
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,053
to make them look like bad guys.

513
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,309
What's that?

514
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,856
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

515
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,109
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

516
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,861
That's right.

ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

518
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,162
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

519
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,375
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethal…

520
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,087
Lethal.

521
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,839
Lethal.

522
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,344
You don't even knock now?

523
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,269
Aren't you worried about the students?

524
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,522
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

525
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,734
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

526
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,444
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

527
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,572
Han-na.

528
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,950
Don't go against the flow.

529
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,202
We do what we're told

530
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,039
without question. Absolute obedience.

531
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,917
The detonator?

532
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,337
The director's daughter is in there.

533
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,256
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

534
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,509
What do you mean?

535
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,511
It's better for you not to know.

536
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,805
What you don't know won't hurt you.

537
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,724
Stop bothering me.

538
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,728
Lethal.

539
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,648
He's here again.

540
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,362
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

541
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,405
That bastard.

542
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,827
He's here!

543
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,922
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

544
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,299
Before the announcement,

545
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,927
I pray for the souls of

546
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,304
the late Eun Yeong-u,

547
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,515
the son of director Eun,

548
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,643
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

549
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:43,772
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

550
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,113
Now,

551
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,158
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

552
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,872
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

553
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,874
came to Korea early this year.

554
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,626
The ANSP

555
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,463
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

556
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,175
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

557
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,930
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

558
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:22,811
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

559
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,731
So we started chasing those two.

560
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,114
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

561
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,743
Want to dig into it?

562
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,202
A case?

563
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,330
What kind of case?

564
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,668
Here! Take photos of these.

565
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,424
These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

566
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:57,596
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

567
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,226
The Hosu hostage situation?

568
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,771
Without An knowing?

569
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,983
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

570
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,359
Take it!

571
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,491
We won't give in

572
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,702
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

573
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,621
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

574
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,000
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

575
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,337
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

576
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,464
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

577
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,759
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

578
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,348
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

579
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,268
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

580
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,562
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

581
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:51,775
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

582
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,694
What about ten days later?

583
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,657
They just created four more spies.

584
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,910
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

585
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,208
Release half of the hostages.

586
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,752
Pardon?

587
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,088
If 30 hostages get released

588
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,841
and say there are only three spies,

589
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,592
won't that be fun to watch?

590
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,972
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

591
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,186
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

592
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,397
Is there anyone you want to release?

593
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:44,327
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

594
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,739
We don't intend to hurt you.

595
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,284
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

596
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,661
To prove that, I will

597
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,290
release 30 of you today.

598
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,502
Quiet!

599
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,174
Ms. Pi.

600
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,801
This is the list of those I'll release.

601
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,762
Call their names.

602
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,602
Yeong-ro.

603
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,937
I think they'll release you.

604
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,397
I hope they'll release us too.

605
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,024
Please.

606
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,237
Je Min-gyeong.

607
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,489
Finally!

608
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,865
Kim Bit-ni.

609
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,158
-Hey!
-Me?

610
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,785
Yang Hye-ji.

611
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,579
Kim Dong-hui.

612
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,499
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

613
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,418
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

614
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,546
30 people right away?

615
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,798
What?

616
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,549
You don't want them?

617
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:26,054
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

618
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,391
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

619
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,894
In return, send in things we demand.

620
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,062
Hey, wait!

621
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,232
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

622
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,818
We'll send in anything you need.

623
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,861
And

624
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,030
Dr. Kang…

625
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,575
Release her right now.

626
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,829
She won't be released.

627
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,082
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

628
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,168
What? A gun?

629
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,713
You…

630
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,465
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

631
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,678
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

632
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,390
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

633
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,397
Some cup noodles too.

634
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,655
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

635
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,618
Hello?

636
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,331
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

637
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,332
Cup noodles.

638
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,002
But what kind of cup noodles?

639
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,603
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

640
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,398
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

641
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,443
How could we not be included in those 30?

642
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,862
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

643
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,698
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

644
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,243
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

645
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,663
Yeong-ro.

646
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,001
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

647
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,799
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

648
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,968
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

649
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,304
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

650
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,264
but she's quite eloquent.

651
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,393
You guys obviously don't know her well.

652
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,354
Hey. Dream on.

653
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,689
Bun-ok.

654
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,111
Go bring some water.

655
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,863
Hot water.

656
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,162
You.

657
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,915
Stay put.

658
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,544
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

659
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,296
You little…

660
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,933
Don't take long!

661
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,990
Hold on. What's that?

662
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,204
Oh, my.

663
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,372
What's all this?

664
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,625
I knew it.

665
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,460
There's always a silver lining.

666
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,129
What are you doing?

667
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:43,269
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

668
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,688
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

669
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,440
How can I ignore this?

670
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,693
How will they know who took it?

671
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,654
I'll just play dumb.

672
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,030
Darn it.

673
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,408
Of course, they'll know.

674
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,537
Because I'll tell them you took it.

675
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,081
Bun-ok.

676
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,208
How could you say that?

677
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,629
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

678
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,341
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

679
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,561
Damn it. Don't come near me.

680
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,812
Stay away.

681
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,523
Darn it.

682
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,547
I told you!

683
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,842
I told you not to do this.

684
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,304
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

685
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,518
That wench talked me into it.

686
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,230
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

687
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,320
I didn't.

688
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,239
I really didn't.

689
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,874
That damn bastard.

690
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,128
I'm so sorry.

691
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,008
Sang-beom.

692
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,052
What happened to your face?

693
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,557
Please, sir.

694
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,656
Sang-beom.

695
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,662
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

696
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,920
Please, sir.

697
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,131
Sir.

698
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,259
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

699
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,262
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

700
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,559
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

701
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,852
Come here, you fool.

702
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,397
Sang-beom!

703
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,149
Sang-beom!

704
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,692
How dare you!

705
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,779
Please, sir! Are you okay?

706
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,327
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

707
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,370
I'm so sorry.

708
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,125
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

709
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,506
Please don't kill them! Please!

710
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,135
Why are you doing this to us?

711
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,097
Please don't kill them! Please!

712
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,307
You bastard!

713
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,351
Stop it, you s***!

714
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,270
Stop it!

715
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,024
You can't do that to an old man!

716
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,155
Go ahead. Shoot me!

717
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,615
Shoot me, you bastard!

718
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,532
Comrade Joo!

719
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,575
Go ahead.

720
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,744
Shoot. Shoot me!

721
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,708
Shoot me, you bastard!

722
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,751
Comrade Joo!

723
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,219
Damn it!

724
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,234
He tried to steal our money--

725
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,361
Lock the three in the prayer room.

726
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,546
That hurts.

727
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,981
You idiot!

728
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,150
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

729
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,695
What on earth did you do this time?

730
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,654
Shut up.

731
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,949
It's all your fault

732
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,660
I turned out this way.

733
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,661
What?

734
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,125
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

735
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,960
There are just three of them.

736
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,795
Can't they just snipe at them?

737
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,591
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

738
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,470
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

739
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,972
Stop it, you idiot!

740
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,808
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

741
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,771
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,690
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

743
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,109
Untie me too. Untie me first!

744
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,320
Listen, sir.

745
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,031
I'll tell you a way out of here,

746
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,574
so take him with you.

747
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,368
A way out of here?

748
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,495
Is there a way out?

749
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,084
Come on.

750
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,045
This way.

751
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,549
Here. This is the one.

752
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,263
Where does this lead?

753
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,390
If you go all the way down the stairs,

754
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,560
you'll find the exit on basement two.

755
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,457
Just keep working.

756
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,422
Hey! You did such a good job!

757
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,467
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

758
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,843
I'm flattered.

759
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,598
These are things they're demanding.

760
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,266
Get them ready

761
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:23,104
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

762
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,940
You mean Jang Han-na?

763
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,276
But she's enraged right now.

764
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,237
How about we send another agent?

765
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,947
That bastard said it must be her.

766
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,283
He specifically told me to send her.

767
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,287
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

768
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,747
Understood, sir.

769
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,335
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

770
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,629
things have been going smoothly.

771
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,008
That goes without saying.

772
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,343
Now,

773
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,223
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

774
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,059
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

775
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,729
Do you mean me?

776
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,067
Right away.

777
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,324
This is so nice.

778
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,410
It really is.

779
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,281
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

780
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,745
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

781
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,581
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,710
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

783
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,046
I'll turn my life around here!

784
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,423
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

785
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,841
Tell me how you will.

786
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,345
You don't need to know.

787
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,930
Just get out of here alone.

788
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,517
How can I possibly leave without you?

789
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,019
God, this is driving me crazy.

790
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,606
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

791
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,109
So stop getting in my way

792
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,985
and just go!

793
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,866
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

794
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:24,410
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

795
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,288
SWAT team, follow me!

796
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,041
A situation occurred.

797
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,004
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

798
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,720
Make him go back in right now.

799
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,222
Make him go back in! At all cost!

800
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,816
Follow me now!

801
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,573
We received an order. Go back in.

802
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,868
Who the hell gave such an order?

803
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,835
The exit.

804
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,382
You crazy bastards!

805
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,349
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

806
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,605
Go back in. It's an order.

807
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:40,986
Go back in!

808
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,150
Sir, please.

809
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:45,611
Please, sir.

810
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,404
Please don't kill him.

811
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,533
How did that bastard get out?

812
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,080
I'll tell you.

813
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,457
He got out through here. This way.

814
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,299
Here.

815
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,339
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

816
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,883
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

817
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,012
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

818
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,597
The doctor?

819
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,726
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

820
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,564
Does it have to do with it?

821
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,777
For the ruling party to regain power,

822
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,114
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

823
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,200
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

824
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,786
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

825
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,378
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

826
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,756
It's taken me

827
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,468
as many as 17 years to come this far.

828
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:36,138
Only a handful of people

829
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:40,058
know who I really am, even in the North.

830
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:45,230
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

831
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,066
proves how much you mean to the party.

832
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,693
Can't you see that?

833
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,909
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

834
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,660
The doctor is what?

835
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,705
The doctor the agency sent in…

836
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,958
is a Northern spy?

837
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,848
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

838
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,229
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

839
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,445
And this hostage-taking too?

840
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,595
Go back to your seats!

841
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,223
What was the gunfire about?

842
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,642
You want us to all die?

843
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:08,230
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

844
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,942
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

845
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,194
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

846
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,572
You made him come back in?

847
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:18,490
Why?

848
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,950
Why do you think?

849
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,954
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

850
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:27,291
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

851
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,209
He'll be a pain in the neck.

852
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:32,379
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

853
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:34,506
the ANSP director's son of all people?

854
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,468
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

855
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:43,265
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

856
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,942
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

857
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,862
Hold out for nine more days,

858
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,781
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

859
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:27,017
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

860
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,811
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

861
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,689
<i>to the North?</i>

862
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,861
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

863
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:41,531
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>

864
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,409
<i>Then…</i>

865
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,705
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

866
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,000
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

867
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,755
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

868
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,554
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

869
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,058
Don't do anything.

870
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,810
You bastard.

871
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,313
Don't you dare touch her!

872
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:44,279
You think you can get out of here alive?

873
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:48,575
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

874
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:53,538
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

875
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,417
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

876
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:02,380
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

877
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:06,593
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

878
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:09,387
Of course, the latter would be better.

879
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,224
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

880
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:17,604
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

881
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,357
You think that makes sense?

882
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:26,530
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

883
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,283
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

884
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,996
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

885
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,333
But my country is different.

886
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,253
What?

887
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,256
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

888
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,260
The party considers the people
as its children.

889
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,971
They'd never abandon us.

890
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,392
Look.

891
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,645
Wake up, will you?

892
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:00,730
You still don't get it.

893
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,149
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

894
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,362
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

895
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:18,373
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

896
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,252
I'll gladly be one.

897
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:33,555
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

898
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,265
in the dorm you can see,

899
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,559
64 hostages, including female students,

900
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:40,937
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

901
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,148
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

902
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,150
people fear for their safety.

903
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,876
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

904
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,169
<i>this is</i>

905
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,256
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

906
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,636
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

907
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,764
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

908
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,433
<i>to use and throw away.</i>

909
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,605
Why aren't they rescuing us?

910
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,899
Why aren't they trying anything?

911
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,610
You are

912
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,697
the director's daughter, right?

913
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,243
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

914
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:20,704
What do I need to do?

915
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,664
Help me. Please.

916
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:30,255
Don't act rashly.

917
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,092
He has a detonator in his pocket.

918
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,219
If he pushes the button,

919
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,889
the whole dorm will explode.

920
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:48,231
I know it's hard, but be patient.

921
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,734
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

922
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:54,821
I just wanted to give him bread.

923
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,541
I need

924
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,626
to go to the restroom.

925
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,962
Can I go?

926
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:27,020
Make it quick.

927
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,946
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

928
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,951
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

929
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,648
Please

930
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,400
let me rest a bit.

931
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,158
Follow me.

932
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,672
You didn't answer my question.

933
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,303
That paper airplane…

934
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,099
That's the one I flew out.

935
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,103
Why do you have it?

936
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,860
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

937
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,323
I just found it while being chased.

938
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,450
Get some rest here.

939
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,329
Then why did you come back?

940
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,250
You should've just left.

941
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:15,670
Why did you come back here?

942
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,309
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

943
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:35,148
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

944
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:40,445
I would never have gone in.

945
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:52,081
I'm sorry…

946
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,294
about your brother.

947
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,097
We will

948
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,184
leave in nine days.

949
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:15,980
All this will be over in nine days.

950
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,985
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

951
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:24,072
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

952
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,325
I want to

953
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,454
release you right now.

954
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,087
But I can't.

955
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:11,536
No. Don't go.

956
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:43,920
If this button is pushed,

957
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:47,632
the dorm will explode.

958
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:50,218
Right?

959
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,148
Eun Yeong-ro!

960
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,985
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

961
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,863
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

962
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,198
You really think so?

963
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:14,700
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

964
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:17,161
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

965
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,288
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

966
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:23,167
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

967
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,378
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

968
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,879
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

969
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,549
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

970
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:31,300
planning to kill the students, are they?

971
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:34,429
Let's save the students together.

972
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,181
How about you use me?

973
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,309
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

974
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,187
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

975
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,397
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

976
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:49,819
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

977
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,411
BONUS

978
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,375
Yeong-ro, close the door.

979
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,127
Pi might smell it and wake up.

980
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:14,343
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

981
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,512
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

982
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,055
Fine. Hurry up.

983
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:23,186
Hey, your partner is really hot.

984
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,146
Set me up with his friend.

985
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:26,981
Yes. Set me up too.

986
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,734
-Please?
-Please?

987
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:33,488
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

988
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,364
-Great!
-Great!

989
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:38,701
His friends? He's being chased--

990
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:48,669
I haven't seen that necklace before.

991
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,840
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

992
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,847
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

993
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:01,641
Good for you!

994
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:04,602
That's pretty. What bird is it?

995
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:06,646
A dove.

996
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,106
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.

997
