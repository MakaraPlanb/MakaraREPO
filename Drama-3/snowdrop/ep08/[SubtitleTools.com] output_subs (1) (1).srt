EPISODE 8

3
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:26,912
Hello?

4
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:29,164
Yes. And?

5
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:32,542
What? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:35,295
Eun Yeong-u?

7
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,799
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

8
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,977
What? Where is he going?

9
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,902
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

10
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,622
You're good at that.

11
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:11,665
Of course.

12
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,716
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,011
I thought you weren't coming today.

14
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:28,265
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

15
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,436
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,773
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

17
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:38,358
to give them some food.

18
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,407
Could you step aside?

19
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:53,456
Step aside?

20
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,264
Or I will for you.

21
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,896
Ma'am, this is bad.

22
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,023
It's Yeong-u.

23
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,610
What?

24
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,322
My son is?

25
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:26,740
Where's my husband?

26
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,658
He's at the hospital.

27
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,870
That rude wench.

28
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,748
Did she just leave without saying bye?

29
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,542
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,128
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

31
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,214
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

32
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,758
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

33
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:48,803
This way, sir.

34
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:54,184
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

35
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,067
Good work, guys.

36
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,616
He's asleep, right?

37
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,076
We gave him a sedative.

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,084
Yeong-u.

39
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,753
I shouldn't have let them

40
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,089
assign you to the front lines.

41
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,515
Dad.

42
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,058
Hey.

43
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,186
I…

44
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,731
promised Mom…

45
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,109
Mom?

46
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:50,156
…that I would protect…

47
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:57,998
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

48
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,667
<i>Mom.</i>

49
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,421
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

50
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,673
So don't worry.

51
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:09,718
I'll make sure she marries

52
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,970
someone who loves her so much.

53
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:16,808
And I'll look out for her by her side
until she becomes an old lady,

54
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,102
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

55
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,314
I'm just three years younger than you.

56
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:32,490
Dad.

57
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,492
Yes?

58
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,204
Yeong-ro…

59
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:46,421
Keep her safe.

60
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,923
Of course, I will.

61
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:52,427
But you should get better
and do it yourself.

62
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:55,764
You should do that.

63
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,394
Yeong-u?

64
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,980
Don't fall asleep. Talk to me.

65
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,399
Cardiac arrest!

66
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,400
What's that sound?

67
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,277
-Move aside!
-Move aside, sir.

68
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,570
Do something!

69
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,239
Yeong-u! Don't fall asleep.

70
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,783
Don't fall asleep!

71
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,409
Yeong-u, wake up!

72
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:17,911
Wake him up!

73
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,496
Come on, do something!

74
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,789
Yeong-u, wake up!

75
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:24,501
Wake him up!

76
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:28,421
Don't fall asleep! Yeong-u!

77
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,015
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

78
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,111
This is the Rhine.

79
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,405
This is the Rhine.

80
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,948
VIP, answer me.

81
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:47,370
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

82
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:51,332
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

83
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,378
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

84
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:58,631
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

85
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:00,842
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

86
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,011
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

87
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:05,805
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

88
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:09,809
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

89
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:13,313
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

90
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:16,691
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

91
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,610
<i>and came to Korea</i>

92
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,362
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

93
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:25,241
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

94
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:28,244
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

95
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:49,432
What…

96
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,185
What did she just say?

97
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,399
My brother…

98
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,195
was killed?

99
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,250
My brother is dead?

100
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:27,470
No…

101
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,100
No…

102
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:33,810
No…

103
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,479
It can't be true.

104
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,942
Why… Why is my brother dead?

105
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:41,984
No…

106
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,737
That's not true…

107
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,953
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

108
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:58,126
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

109
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,127
Eun Yeong-ro!

110
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,129
Eun Yeong-ro!

111
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,508
-Yeong-ro!
-Yeong-u!

112
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:10,388
Let go! Let go of me!

113
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,056
Calm down!

114
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,768
I need to go see for myself!

115
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,482
It's dangerous.
You don't want to die, do you?

116
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,637
You're the leader of those
who killed Yeong-u?

117
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,557
You evil bastard.

118
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,435
Holding us hostage wasn't enough?
Why did you kill my brother?

119
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,187
What did he do wrong?

120
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,481
He didn't do anything to deserve it!

121
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,401
Bring him back.

122
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,904
Bring him back!

123
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,036
DORM ROOM 208

00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:59,205
DORM ROOM 205
DORM ROOM 204

126
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,059
2ND FLOOR LOUNGE

127
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,240
<i>Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.</i>

128
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:36,492
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

129
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,911
<i>After roll-call, in room 207,</i>

130
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:42,456
<i>Yeo Jeong-min, Ko Hye-ryeong,
Yoon Seol-hui, and Eun Yeong-ro</i>

131
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,626
<i>ate</i> ramyeon <i>and chat with Lee Jang-hui
from room 209</i>

132
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,129
<i>and Kim Gang-hui and Lim So-yeon
from room 206.</i>

133
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:51,340
<i>Yeong-ro received a necklace as a gift
from an unnamed man who was</i>

134
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,925
<i>her partner at the Open House.</i>

135
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,969
<i>They must be seeing each other.</i>

136
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,346
The girl who treated me?

137
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,059
<i>I heard the ANSP director's son is dead.
What if they try to retaliate against us?</i>

138
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,233
<i>Did you forget about the instructions?</i>

139
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:12,695
But they were given before his death.

140
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,365
<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

141
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,285
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

142
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,162
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

143
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,498
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

144
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:29,045
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

145
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,885
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

146
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,888
<i>A bomb?</i>

147
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:41,682
If they try to deceive us again,

148
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:45,519
I'll push the button.

149
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,853
Talk about bad timing.

150
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,230
If only you'd come in a bit later.

151
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,816
Turn around.

152
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,177
That…

153
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,846
Why is that…

154
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,366
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

155
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:06,994
Don't try anything funny.

156
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,330
Will you blow everyone up?

157
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:13,834
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

158
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,172
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

159
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,427
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

160
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,269
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

161
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,313
I won't let it slide twice.

162
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:37,942
"That woman"? Who?

163
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:43,906
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

164
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,450
Just colleagues.

165
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,259
Go in.

166
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:32,705
How is she?

167
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,124
I gave her a tranquilizer,

168
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,793
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

169
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,724
Can we have a word for a minute?

170
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:17,750
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

171
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,501
but we never know

172
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,379
how things will turn out and when.

173
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:25,299
You know that, right?

174
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,801
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,678
So the ANSP director's daughter…

176
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,100
hid you in this dorm?

177
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:37,770
Yes.

178
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:45,194
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

179
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:51,116
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

180
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,665
I never had any personal feelings for her.

181
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,378
I'm relieved to hear that.

182
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:15,182
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

183
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,142
but the news about it just broke out.

184
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:19,311
And my face has been disclosed.

185
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:24,108
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

186
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,237
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:32,241
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

188
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,451
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

189
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:36,996
I just don't trust the ANSP.

190
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,831
As I told you,

191
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,793
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

192
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,337
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

193
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:51,093
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

194
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,970
Would the party really have

195
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:56,181
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

196
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,476
Then…

197
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,855
let me ask you one thing.

198
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,070
Why in ten days?

199
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,990
You seriously don't know?

200
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:17,494
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

201
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,160
That's a bomb, isn't it?

202
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:02,873
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

203
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,292
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

204
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,337
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

205
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:13,175
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

206
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,677
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

207
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,096
Keep it down.

208
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,182
He took her out of here in secret.

209
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,309
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:25,479
Get back to sleep.

211
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:28,565
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

212
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,193
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

213
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:32,611
I saw it with my own eyes!

214
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:33,821
Gye Bun-ok.

215
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:37,699
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

216
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,993
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

217
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,579
It's already been two hours.

218
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,165
They must've released her. Right?

219
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:46,375
Of course not.

220
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:50,879
She passed out.

221
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:55,217
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

222
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,636
Her brother died?

223
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,513
I feel so bad for her.

224
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:02,266
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

225
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,112
Honey.

226
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,115
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

227
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,118
It's all my fault.

228
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,496
I'm the one who got him killed.

229
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,959
That's not your fault.

230
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,879
When you sent him to the front lines,

231
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:35,757
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

232
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,802
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

233
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:40,971
Very enthusiastically, at that.

234
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:44,558
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

235
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:48,896
Honey.

236
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,483
I know it's really hard for you,

237
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:56,236
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

238
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,407
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

239
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,328
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

240
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:07,623
If Code 1 finds out

241
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:10,334
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

242
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,920
Now that the operation has failed,

243
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:15,005
if you're pushed out,

244
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,215
what about Yeong-ro?

245
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:18,425
We can't bring Yeong-u back,

246
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:20,719
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

247
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,347
I know you made a deal with the North,

248
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,851
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

249
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,229
Honey!

250
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,774
You must pull yourself together!

251
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,985
I know. I know that.

252
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:38,987
Yeong-u…

253
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:40,864
Yeong-u…

254
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,703
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

255
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:49,623
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

256
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:53,085
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

257
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,170
I'm just three years younger than you.

258
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:04,471
Yeong-u!

259
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,184
Yeong-u!

260
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:12,521
Yeong-u!

261
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:16,483
Yeong-u…

262
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:19,987
Yeong-u!

263
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:25,951
Yeong-u…

264
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:28,704
Get it together.

265
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,957
My brother

266
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,917
is gone.

267
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,005
You must've had a nightmare.

268
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:39,881
Don't you remember

269
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:41,550
passing out?

270
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:01,028
It's all right.

271
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:02,029
It's okay.

272
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:05,198
All right, breathe in again.

273
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:09,911
It's okay.

274
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,210
<i>Wait.</i>

275
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:23,091
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

276
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:32,768
I'm sorry,

277
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:37,898
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

278
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:44,488
They must be mistaken.

279
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,698
Maybe someone by the same name.

280
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:37,666
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

281
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:41,086
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

282
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,088
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

283
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:47,050
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

284
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:50,512
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

285
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:54,599
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

286
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,019
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

287
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:27,257
Go back to the room.

288
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,056
Go back to the room.

289
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,018
Let me go.

290
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,857
Let me out.

291
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,491
My brother…

292
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:58,205
I want to go see my brother.

293
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,044
Please.

294
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:06,922
Please let me see him one last time.

295
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:46,169
Thank you.

296
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:47,754
What? Okay.

297
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:55,011
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

298
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:58,348
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

299
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:06,481
Be strong.

300
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:12,988
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

301
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:17,409
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

302
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:20,036
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

303
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:23,582
They just lost their child.

304
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,213
Right.

305
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:34,092
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

306
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:38,096
Yes,

307
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:41,433
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

308
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:45,812
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

309
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,022
-Stop it.
-It's just…

310
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,651
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

311
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:53,904
Stay strong.

312
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,333
Let's go.

313
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,799
I can't believe you!

314
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:15,884
I just…

315
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,222
I mean,

316
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:25,769
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

317
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,813
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

318
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:31,483
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

319
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:32,734
That's enough!

320
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,862
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

321
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:36,947
I mean,

322
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,618
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

323
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:42,994
What a sly snake.

324
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:46,915
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

325
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,544
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

326
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,339
Wait.

327
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:58,343
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

328
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,267
What do I do with you?

329
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,480
Eun's wife caught on quick.

330
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,440
You seriously don't know?

331
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,943
What other than the hostage situation?

332
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,531
You'll use the hostage-taking?

333
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:23,868
But what if something
happens to the students?

334
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:24,869
Do you think--

335
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:28,081
That's not important right now!

336
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:32,585
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

337
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,464
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

338
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:38,925
My goodness.

339
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,014
Honey.

340
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:50,311
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:54,649
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

342
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:57,027
unless 13 people die,

343
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,779
it'll be all for nothing.

344
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,077
What are you talking about?

345
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,209
For Eun to become president,

346
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:17,672
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

347
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:20,633
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

348
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:23,720
He's not just any fortuneteller.

349
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:28,308
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

350
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:32,645
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

351
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:35,774
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

352
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:37,609
I told you never to talk about it!

353
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:40,487
How many times must I tell you?

354
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,739
Right.

355
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,783
Gosh.

356
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,120
I'm sorry, honey.

357
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,083
I forgot.

358
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:59,047
You must want to screw me over.

359
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,840
There's no other explanation.

360
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:02,258
God damn it!

361
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:08,181
Darn it.

362
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,475
That little sly minx.

363
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,942
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

364
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:22,987
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

365
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:26,157
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

366
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,534
No!

367
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:31,329
You should leave out the protesting part.

368
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:35,083
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

369
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,961
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

370
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:39,963
I understand, ma'am.

371
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:45,009
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

372
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,637
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>

373
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:52,600
By the way, I should go there
to pay my respects to him.

374
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:55,436
You just focus on preparing
for tomorrow's announcement.

375
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,731
Don't worry. We're even rehearsing it.

376
00:34:59,023 --> 00:34:59,983
Salute!

377
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:07,365
Where were we?

378
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,289
<i>Let's continue.</i>

379
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:17,584
I'm Gal Sang-sik from JBC.

380
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,253
Thank you.

381
00:35:21,004 --> 00:35:23,965
The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

382
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:27,218
Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

383
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:29,679
of the opposition candidate for it?

384
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,140
I told you.

385
00:35:34,392 --> 00:35:36,144
In Professor Han's bag,

386
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:39,272
we found a letter
from his son in the North

387
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:41,316
that says they should destroy

388
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,109
the pro-US candidate--

389
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,068
No!

390
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:47,488
You can't get so worked up.

391
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:48,823
Right.

392
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,201
I should relax.

393
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:52,243
Let me try it again.

394
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,078
Are you going to do this all night?

395
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,831
Look.

396
00:35:56,915 --> 00:36:00,335
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

397
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:03,463
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

398
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,298
Of course, it must go perfectly!

399
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,177
Guys.

400
00:36:12,013 --> 00:36:13,848
What should I wear tomorrow?

401
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:15,099
Pardon?

402
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,376
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

403
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:42,080

CAFETERIA

407
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:01,432
Take your time and eat little by little.

408
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:03,434
Here.

409
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:27,333
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

410
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,464
Or you'll collapse.

411
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:44,934
I think he should be untied to eat this.

412
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,940
-Untie him.
-Okay.

413
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:52,775
Come on.

414
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:58,739
Hey, come eat.

415
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,199
What are you doing?

416
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,910
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

417
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,329
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

418
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,294
This is for you. Come on.

419
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:13,463
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

420
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:19,051
-Sir.
-Yes?

421
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:21,762
Why don't you eat with me?

422
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:53,628
Did you sleep at all?

423
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:56,756
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

424
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,553
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

425
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,683
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

426
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:10,269
this wouldn't be happening.

427
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:14,023
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

428
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,149
Stop it.

429
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,492
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

430
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:27,453
but I still don't get why

431
00:41:27,537 --> 00:41:29,622
she stopped us from searching like that.

432
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:32,375
I found that weird too.

433
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:36,712
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

434
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,756
What if he harmed the kids?

435
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,509
She should've been scared
and let you search.

436
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:46,180
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

437
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,019
There are many?

438
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:55,648
Yes. Once a month,

439
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:59,193
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

440
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:01,362
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:02,363
Just eat.

442
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:04,907
You said you found it suspicious too.

443
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,493
Suspicious?

444
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:10,454
Maybe she has no family.

445
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:12,748
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

446
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:14,375
But once a month,

447
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:19,922
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

448
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:31,350
<i>All exhausted?</i>

449
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:33,978
Yes. That's not all.

450
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:37,565
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

451
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:38,899
Hey, now.

452
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:40,276
Shut it.

453
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,321
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

454
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:46,115
What on earth did you overhear?

455
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:53,080
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

456
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:55,833
Ms. Pi's picture.

457
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:57,501
Picture?

458
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:04,634
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

459
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,724
Put him on right now!

460
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:13,851
Don't you know who I am?

461
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:15,519
I'm still the hall director!

462
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:21,233
Sir.

463
00:43:22,777 --> 00:43:26,447
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

464
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:31,327
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

465
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,704
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

466
00:43:34,705 --> 00:43:36,832
Can just anyone be in this position?

467
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:41,504
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

468
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:44,006
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

469
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,635
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

470
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,810
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

471
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,938
My cousin lives in Munich.

472
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:01,691
<i>My goodness.</i>

473
00:44:01,774 --> 00:44:05,945
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

474
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:10,074
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

475
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:12,785
She's not good enough to be my successor.

476
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,041
I'm quitting, but I care.

477
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:22,962
Who the hell asked you to do this?

478
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:27,091
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

479
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,970
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

480
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,346
Do you understand?

481
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:35,599
Ma'am.

482
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,110
<i>And that night,</i>

483
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,697
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>

484
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:54,034
Killed herself?

485
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:55,745
Why?

486
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:57,913
How would I know?

487
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:01,459
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

488
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:04,211
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

489
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:05,963
But why did she

490
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:09,467
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

491
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,220
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

492
00:45:13,304 --> 00:45:14,764
I don't know.

493
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:17,391
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

494
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:19,810
Anyway,

495
00:45:19,894 --> 00:45:23,272
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

496
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:28,986
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

497
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:51,425
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

498
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:57,473
Hey.

499
00:45:58,057 --> 00:45:59,183
Yes?

500
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:00,935
Showing off your drawing skills?

501
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:02,436
Is that it?

502
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,021
Darn it.

503
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:06,857
Add a scar or something.

504
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,235
Right here.

505
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:11,028
A scar? What for?

506
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:23,415
You drew him well. It's very similar.

507
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:24,542
Thank you.

508
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,002
We're not using it to catch him.

509
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,088
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

510
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:31,423
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

511
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:33,592
We need the other guys to look scary

512
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:36,053
to make them look like bad guys.

513
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:42,309
What's that?

514
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:46,856
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

515
00:46:46,939 --> 00:46:50,109
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

516
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:51,861
That's right.

ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

518
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:02,162
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

519
00:47:02,246 --> 00:47:06,375
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethal…

520
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:10,087
Lethal.

521
00:47:10,671 --> 00:47:11,839
Lethal.

522
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,344
You don't even knock now?

523
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:25,269
Aren't you worried about the students?

524
00:47:25,352 --> 00:47:28,522
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

525
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:31,734
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

526
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:33,444
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

527
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:36,572
Han-na.

528
00:47:37,573 --> 00:47:39,950
Don't go against the flow.

529
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:42,202
We do what we're told

530
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:45,039
without question. Absolute obedience.

531
00:47:46,957 --> 00:47:47,917
The detonator?

532
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:51,337
The director's daughter is in there.

533
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,256
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

534
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,509
What do you mean?

535
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:59,511
It's better for you not to know.

536
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:01,805
What you don't know won't hurt you.

537
00:48:02,598 --> 00:48:03,724
Stop bothering me.

538
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:07,728
Lethal.

539
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:10,648
He's here again.

540
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,362
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

541
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:18,405
That bastard.

542
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,827
He's here!

543
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:34,922
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

544
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:37,299
Before the announcement,

545
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:39,927
I pray for the souls of

546
00:48:40,427 --> 00:48:42,304
the late Eun Yeong-u,

547
00:48:42,388 --> 00:48:44,515
the son of director Eun,

548
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:47,643
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

549
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:51,772
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

550
00:48:58,112 --> 00:48:59,113
Now,

551
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:03,158
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

552
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,872
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

553
00:49:09,415 --> 00:49:10,874
came to Korea early this year.

554
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,626
The ANSP

555
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,463
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

556
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:20,175
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

557
00:49:20,676 --> 00:49:24,930
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

558
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:30,811
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

559
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:33,731
So we started chasing those two.

560
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:42,114
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

561
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:45,743
Want to dig into it?

562
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:47,202
A case?

563
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,330
What kind of case?

564
00:49:52,374 --> 00:49:54,668
Here! Take photos of these.

565
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,424
These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

566
00:50:00,507 --> 00:50:05,596
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

567
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,226
The Hosu hostage situation?

568
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:13,771
Without An knowing?

569
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:17,983
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

570
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:19,359
Take it!

571
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:25,491
We won't give in

572
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:28,702
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

573
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,621
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

574
00:50:31,413 --> 00:50:35,000
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

575
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:38,337
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

576
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,464
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

577
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:43,759
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

578
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:49,348
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

579
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:53,268
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

580
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,562
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

581
00:50:55,646 --> 00:50:59,775
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

582
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:02,694
What about ten days later?

583
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:06,657
They just created four more spies.

584
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,910
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

585
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,208
Release half of the hostages.

586
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:18,752
Pardon?

587
00:51:18,836 --> 00:51:21,088
If 30 hostages get released

588
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:23,841
and say there are only three spies,

589
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:25,592
won't that be fun to watch?

590
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,972
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

591
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:36,186
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

592
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,397
Is there anyone you want to release?

593
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:52,327
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

594
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,739
We don't intend to hurt you.

595
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:32,284
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

596
00:52:32,951 --> 00:52:34,661
To prove that, I will

597
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:38,290
release 30 of you today.

598
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:42,502
Quiet!

599
00:52:45,964 --> 00:52:47,174
Ms. Pi.

600
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:49,801
This is the list of those I'll release.

601
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:51,762
Call their names.

602
00:52:57,434 --> 00:52:58,602
Yeong-ro.

603
00:52:58,727 --> 00:52:59,937
I think they'll release you.

604
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:02,397
I hope they'll release us too.

605
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:04,024
Please.

606
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:08,237
Je Min-gyeong.

607
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:10,489
Finally!

608
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:11,865
Kim Bit-ni.

609
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:13,158
-Hey!
-Me?

610
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:14,785
Yang Hye-ji.

611
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:17,579
Kim Dong-hui.

612
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:20,499
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

613
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:23,418
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

614
00:53:24,878 --> 00:53:26,546
30 people right away?

615
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,798
What?

616
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,549
You don't want them?

617
00:53:30,884 --> 00:53:34,054
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

618
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:37,391
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

619
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:40,894
In return, send in things we demand.

620
00:53:40,978 --> 00:53:42,062
Hey, wait!

621
00:53:43,146 --> 00:53:45,232
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

622
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:47,818
We'll send in anything you need.

623
00:53:48,944 --> 00:53:49,861
And

624
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:52,030
Dr. Kang…

625
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,575
Release her right now.

626
00:53:57,703 --> 00:53:58,829
She won't be released.

627
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:02,082
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

628
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:05,168
What? A gun?

629
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:07,713
You…

630
00:54:07,796 --> 00:54:10,465
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

631
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:14,678
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

632
00:54:15,387 --> 00:54:18,390
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

633
00:54:23,854 --> 00:54:25,397
Some cup noodles too.

634
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:33,655
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

635
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:38,618
Hello?

636
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:42,331
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

637
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:43,332
Cup noodles.

638
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,002
But what kind of cup noodles?

639
00:55:02,351 --> 00:55:04,603
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

640
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:08,398
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

641
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:11,443
How could we not be included in those 30?

642
00:55:11,526 --> 00:55:13,862
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

643
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:16,698
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

644
00:55:17,032 --> 00:55:20,243
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

645
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:23,663
Yeong-ro.

646
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,001
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

647
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:33,799
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

648
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:36,968
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

649
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:39,304
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

650
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:41,264
but she's quite eloquent.

651
00:55:41,348 --> 00:55:44,393
You guys obviously don't know her well.

652
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:47,354
Hey. Dream on.

653
00:55:48,772 --> 00:55:49,689
Bun-ok.

654
00:55:52,943 --> 00:55:54,111
Go bring some water.

655
00:55:55,779 --> 00:55:56,863
Hot water.

656
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,162
You.

657
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:06,915
Stay put.

658
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,544
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

659
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:13,296
You little…

660
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:24,933
Don't take long!

661
00:57:19,362 --> 00:57:21,990
Hold on. What's that?

662
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:27,204
Oh, my.

663
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:29,372
What's all this?

664
00:57:30,457 --> 00:57:31,625
I knew it.

665
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:33,460
There's always a silver lining.

666
00:57:34,544 --> 00:57:36,129
What are you doing?

667
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:51,269
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

668
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:53,688
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

669
00:57:53,772 --> 00:57:55,440
How can I ignore this?

670
00:57:57,025 --> 00:57:58,693
How will they know who took it?

671
00:57:58,777 --> 00:58:00,654
I'll just play dumb.

672
00:58:00,737 --> 00:58:02,030
Darn it.

673
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:05,408
Of course, they'll know.

674
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:08,537
Because I'll tell them you took it.

675
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:11,081
Bun-ok.

676
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:13,208
How could you say that?

677
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:17,629
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

678
00:58:18,129 --> 00:58:21,341
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

679
00:58:30,892 --> 00:58:32,561
Damn it. Don't come near me.

680
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:33,812
Stay away.

681
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:36,523
Darn it.

682
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,547
I told you!

683
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:03,842
I told you not to do this.

684
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:07,304
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

685
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:13,518
That wench talked me into it.

686
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:17,230
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

687
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:23,320
I didn't.

688
00:59:24,863 --> 00:59:26,239
I really didn't.

689
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,874
That damn bastard.

690
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:40,128
I'm so sorry.

691
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:45,008
Sang-beom.

692
00:59:45,091 --> 00:59:47,052
What happened to your face?

693
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:52,557
Please, sir.

694
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:07,656
Sang-beom.

695
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:55,662
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

696
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,920
Please, sir.

697
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:06,131
Sir.

698
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:09,259
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

699
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:12,262
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

700
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:17,559
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

701
01:01:17,726 --> 01:01:18,852
Come here, you fool.

702
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:22,397
Sang-beom!

703
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,149
Sang-beom!

704
01:01:24,232 --> 01:01:25,692
How dare you!

705
01:01:27,527 --> 01:01:29,779
Please, sir! Are you okay?

706
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:36,327
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

707
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:37,370
I'm so sorry.

708
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:42,125
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

709
01:01:45,795 --> 01:01:48,506
Please don't kill them! Please!

710
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:52,135
Why are you doing this to us?

711
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:56,097
Please don't kill them! Please!

712
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,307
You bastard!

713
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:00,351
Stop it, you s***!

714
01:02:01,186 --> 01:02:02,270
Stop it!

715
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,024
You can't do that to an old man!

716
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:12,155
Go ahead. Shoot me!

717
01:02:12,238 --> 01:02:13,615
Shoot me, you bastard!

718
01:02:13,698 --> 01:02:14,532
Comrade Joo!

719
01:02:14,616 --> 01:02:15,575
Go ahead.

720
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:17,744
Shoot. Shoot me!

721
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,708
Shoot me, you bastard!

722
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:24,751
Comrade Joo!

723
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:34,219
Damn it!

724
01:02:47,607 --> 01:02:49,234
He tried to steal our money--

725
01:02:49,317 --> 01:02:51,361
Lock the three in the prayer room.

726
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:09,546
That hurts.

727
01:03:26,396 --> 01:03:27,981
You idiot!

728
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:31,150
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

729
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:33,695
What on earth did you do this time?

730
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:34,654
Shut up.

731
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:37,949
It's all your fault

732
01:03:39,242 --> 01:03:40,660
I turned out this way.

733
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:41,661
What?

734
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,125
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

735
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:48,960
There are just three of them.

736
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:50,795
Can't they just snipe at them?

737
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:54,591
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

738
01:03:56,426 --> 01:03:59,470
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

739
01:03:59,554 --> 01:04:00,972
Stop it, you idiot!

740
01:04:01,055 --> 01:04:03,808
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

741
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:08,771
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:10,690
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

743
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:13,109
Untie me too. Untie me first!

744
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,320
Listen, sir.

745
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:18,031
I'll tell you a way out of here,

746
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:19,574
so take him with you.

747
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,368
A way out of here?

748
01:04:22,952 --> 01:04:24,495
Is there a way out?

749
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:30,084
Come on.

750
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:32,045
This way.

751
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,549
Here. This is the one.

752
01:04:39,135 --> 01:04:42,263
Where does this lead?

753
01:04:42,347 --> 01:04:44,390
If you go all the way down the stairs,

754
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:47,560
you'll find the exit on basement two.

755
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:09,457
Just keep working.

756
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:16,422
Hey! You did such a good job!

757
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:19,467
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

758
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,843
I'm flattered.

759
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:25,598
These are things they're demanding.

760
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:27,266
Get them ready

761
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:31,104
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

762
01:05:32,397 --> 01:05:33,940
You mean Jang Han-na?

763
01:05:35,483 --> 01:05:37,276
But she's enraged right now.

764
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,237
How about we send another agent?

765
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,947
That bastard said it must be her.

766
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:44,283
He specifically told me to send her.

767
01:05:44,492 --> 01:05:48,287
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

768
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:49,747
Understood, sir.

769
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:54,335
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

770
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:56,629
things have been going smoothly.

771
01:05:58,923 --> 01:06:00,008
That goes without saying.

772
01:06:01,426 --> 01:06:02,343
Now,

773
01:06:04,137 --> 01:06:07,223
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

774
01:06:08,057 --> 01:06:10,059
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

775
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:12,729
Do you mean me?

776
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:18,067
Right away.

777
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,324
This is so nice.

778
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,410
It really is.

779
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:05,281
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

780
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:10,745
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

781
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:13,581
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:17,710
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

783
01:07:17,794 --> 01:07:20,046
I'll turn my life around here!

784
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:22,423
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

785
01:07:22,507 --> 01:07:23,841
Tell me how you will.

786
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:27,345
You don't need to know.

787
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,930
Just get out of here alone.

788
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:32,517
How can I possibly leave without you?

789
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,019
God, this is driving me crazy.

790
01:07:35,103 --> 01:07:38,606
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

791
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:41,109
So stop getting in my way

792
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:42,985
and just go!

793
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,866
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

794
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:32,410
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

795
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:35,288
SWAT team, follow me!

796
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,041
A situation occurred.

797
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:43,004
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

798
01:08:49,218 --> 01:08:50,720
Make him go back in right now.

799
01:08:50,803 --> 01:08:53,222
Make him go back in! At all cost!

800
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,816
Follow me now!

801
01:09:08,654 --> 01:09:10,573
We received an order. Go back in.

802
01:09:12,074 --> 01:09:13,868
Who the hell gave such an order?

803
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:22,835
The exit.

804
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:28,382
You crazy bastards!

805
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,349
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

806
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:42,605
Go back in. It's an order.

807
01:09:47,693 --> 01:09:48,986
Go back in!

808
01:11:50,316 --> 01:11:51,150
Sir, please.

809
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:53,611
Please, sir.

810
01:11:53,694 --> 01:11:55,404
Please don't kill him.

811
01:11:57,907 --> 01:11:59,533
How did that bastard get out?

812
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:04,080
I'll tell you.

813
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:06,457
He got out through here. This way.

814
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:15,299
Here.

815
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:55,339
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

816
01:12:56,674 --> 01:12:57,883
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

817
01:12:58,426 --> 01:13:02,012
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

818
01:13:02,596 --> 01:13:03,597
The doctor?

819
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:07,726
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

820
01:13:09,854 --> 01:13:11,564
Does it have to do with it?

821
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:16,777
For the ruling party to regain power,

822
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:20,114
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

823
01:13:20,197 --> 01:13:23,200
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

824
01:13:23,784 --> 01:13:25,786
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

825
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:34,378
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

826
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:37,756
It's taken me

827
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,468
as many as 17 years to come this far.

828
01:13:42,344 --> 01:13:44,138
Only a handful of people

829
01:13:45,347 --> 01:13:48,058
know who I really am, even in the North.

830
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:53,230
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

831
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:56,066
proves how much you mean to the party.

832
01:13:56,484 --> 01:13:57,693
Can't you see that?

833
01:14:03,741 --> 01:14:04,909
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

834
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:06,660
The doctor is what?

835
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:09,705
The doctor the agency sent in…

836
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,958
is a Northern spy?

837
01:14:25,638 --> 01:14:27,848
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

838
01:14:31,477 --> 01:14:33,229
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

839
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:41,445
And this hostage-taking too?

840
01:15:04,885 --> 01:15:06,595
Go back to your seats!

841
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:09,223
What was the gunfire about?

842
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:11,642
You want us to all die?

843
01:15:12,226 --> 01:15:16,230
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

844
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:19,942
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

845
01:15:20,025 --> 01:15:22,194
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

846
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:24,572
You made him come back in?

847
01:15:25,614 --> 01:15:26,490
Why?

848
01:15:26,574 --> 01:15:27,950
Why do you think?

849
01:15:28,576 --> 01:15:31,954
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

850
01:15:32,037 --> 01:15:35,291
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

851
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:37,209
He'll be a pain in the neck.

852
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:40,379
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

853
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,506
the ANSP director's son of all people?

854
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:46,468
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

855
01:15:46,552 --> 01:15:51,265
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

856
01:15:58,772 --> 01:16:01,942
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

857
01:16:02,901 --> 01:16:04,862
Hold out for nine more days,

858
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:07,781
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

859
01:16:32,181 --> 01:16:35,017
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

860
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:37,811
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

861
01:16:39,021 --> 01:16:40,689
<i>to the North?</i>

862
01:16:42,983 --> 01:16:45,861
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

863
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:49,531
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>

864
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:52,409
<i>Then…</i>

865
01:16:53,994 --> 01:16:56,705
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

866
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:00,000
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

867
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,755
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

868
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:35,554
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

869
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:40,058
Don't do anything.

870
01:18:40,142 --> 01:18:41,810
You bastard.

871
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:44,313
Don't you dare touch her!

872
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:52,279
You think you can get out of here alive?

873
01:18:53,113 --> 01:18:56,575
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

874
01:18:57,075 --> 01:19:01,538
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

875
01:19:03,457 --> 01:19:05,417
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

876
01:19:06,001 --> 01:19:10,380
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

877
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:14,593
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

878
01:19:15,552 --> 01:19:17,387
Of course, the latter would be better.

879
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:20,224
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

880
01:19:21,934 --> 01:19:25,604
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

881
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:28,357
You think that makes sense?

882
01:19:30,692 --> 01:19:34,530
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

883
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:38,283
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

884
01:19:40,285 --> 01:19:42,996
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

885
01:19:44,373 --> 01:19:46,333
But my country is different.

886
01:19:48,418 --> 01:19:49,253
What?

887
01:19:49,336 --> 01:19:52,256
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

888
01:19:53,882 --> 01:19:56,260
The party considers the people
as its children.

889
01:19:57,261 --> 01:19:58,971
They'd never abandon us.

890
01:20:02,224 --> 01:20:03,392
Look.

891
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,645
Wake up, will you?

892
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:08,730
You still don't get it.

893
01:20:08,814 --> 01:20:11,149
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

894
01:20:11,692 --> 01:20:15,362
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

895
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:26,373
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

896
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:30,252
I'll gladly be one.

897
01:20:38,635 --> 01:20:41,555
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

898
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:43,265
in the dorm you can see,

899
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:45,559
64 hostages, including female students,

900
01:20:45,642 --> 01:20:48,937
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

901
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:51,148
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

902
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:53,150
people fear for their safety.

903
01:21:07,247 --> 01:21:10,876
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

904
01:21:11,335 --> 01:21:12,169
<i>this is</i>

905
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,256
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

906
01:21:19,301 --> 01:21:20,636
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

907
01:21:21,887 --> 01:21:23,764
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

908
01:21:24,681 --> 01:21:26,433
<i>to use and throw away.</i>

909
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:13,605
Why aren't they rescuing us?

910
01:22:14,189 --> 01:22:15,899
Why aren't they trying anything?

911
01:22:17,651 --> 01:22:18,610
You are

912
01:22:20,028 --> 01:22:21,697
the director's daughter, right?

913
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:26,243
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

914
01:22:27,285 --> 01:22:28,704
What do I need to do?

915
01:22:28,787 --> 01:22:30,664
Help me. Please.

916
01:22:36,586 --> 01:22:38,255
Don't act rashly.

917
01:22:39,965 --> 01:22:42,092
He has a detonator in his pocket.

918
01:22:42,676 --> 01:22:44,219
If he pushes the button,

919
01:22:46,013 --> 01:22:47,889
the whole dorm will explode.

920
01:22:53,645 --> 01:22:56,231
I know it's hard, but be patient.

921
01:22:57,149 --> 01:22:58,734
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

922
01:23:01,278 --> 01:23:02,821
I just wanted to give him bread.

923
01:23:13,707 --> 01:23:14,541
I need

924
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:16,626
to go to the restroom.

925
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:18,962
Can I go?

926
01:23:33,852 --> 01:23:35,020
Make it quick.

927
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:44,946
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

928
01:23:46,782 --> 01:23:49,951
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

929
01:24:18,438 --> 01:24:19,648
Please

930
01:24:21,066 --> 01:24:22,400
let me rest a bit.

931
01:24:29,116 --> 01:24:30,158
Follow me.

932
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:43,672
You didn't answer my question.

933
01:24:49,136 --> 01:24:50,303
That paper airplane…

934
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:54,099
That's the one I flew out.

935
01:24:56,685 --> 01:24:58,103
Why do you have it?

936
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:04,860
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

937
01:25:08,405 --> 01:25:10,323
I just found it while being chased.

938
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:12,450
Get some rest here.

939
01:25:15,078 --> 01:25:16,329
Then why did you come back?

940
01:25:18,832 --> 01:25:20,250
You should've just left.

941
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:23,670
Why did you come back here?

942
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,309
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

943
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:43,148
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

944
01:25:46,943 --> 01:25:48,445
I would never have gone in.

945
01:25:58,955 --> 01:26:00,081
I'm sorry…

946
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,294
about your brother.

947
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:16,097
We will

948
01:26:17,641 --> 01:26:19,184
leave in nine days.

949
01:26:22,103 --> 01:26:23,980
All this will be over in nine days.

950
01:26:26,316 --> 01:26:28,985
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

951
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:32,072
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

952
01:26:33,823 --> 01:26:35,325
I want to

953
01:26:37,744 --> 01:26:39,454
release you right now.

954
01:26:45,585 --> 01:26:47,087
But I can't.

955
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:19,536
No. Don't go.

956
01:28:50,752 --> 01:28:51,920
If this button is pushed,

957
01:28:53,671 --> 01:28:55,632
the dorm will explode.

958
01:28:57,008 --> 01:28:58,218
Right?

959
01:29:11,064 --> 01:29:12,148
Eun Yeong-ro!

960
01:29:12,732 --> 01:29:15,985
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

961
01:29:16,069 --> 01:29:18,863
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

962
01:29:18,947 --> 01:29:20,198
You really think so?

963
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:22,700
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

964
01:29:22,784 --> 01:29:25,161
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

965
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:27,288
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

966
01:29:27,372 --> 01:29:31,167
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

967
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:33,378
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

968
01:29:33,461 --> 01:29:34,879
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

969
01:29:34,963 --> 01:29:37,549
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

970
01:29:37,632 --> 01:29:39,300
planning to kill the students, are they?

971
01:29:39,384 --> 01:29:42,429
Let's save the students together.

972
01:29:43,179 --> 01:29:45,181
How about you use me?

973
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:48,309
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

974
01:29:48,393 --> 01:29:51,187
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

975
01:29:51,271 --> 01:29:52,397
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

976
01:29:54,566 --> 01:29:57,819
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

977
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:06,411
BONUS

978
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:12,375
Yeong-ro, close the door.

979
01:30:12,459 --> 01:30:14,127
Pi might smell it and wake up.

980
01:30:20,592 --> 01:30:22,343
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

981
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:24,512
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

982
01:30:24,596 --> 01:30:26,055
Fine. Hurry up.

983
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:31,186
Hey, your partner is really hot.

984
01:30:31,853 --> 01:30:33,146
Set me up with his friend.

985
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:34,981
Yes. Set me up too.

986
01:30:35,064 --> 01:30:37,734
-Please?
-Please?

987
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:41,488
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

988
01:30:41,571 --> 01:30:43,364
-Great!
-Great!

989
01:30:44,282 --> 01:30:46,701
His friends? He's being chased--

990
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:56,669
I haven't seen that necklace before.

991
01:30:58,963 --> 01:31:00,840
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

992
01:31:05,845 --> 01:31:07,847
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

993
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:09,641
Good for you!

994
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:12,602
That's pretty. What bird is it?

995
01:31:13,436 --> 01:31:14,646
A dove.

996
01:31:15,313 --> 01:31:17,106
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.

997
