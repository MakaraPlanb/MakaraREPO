00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.034 line:85.83%,end
Killed herself?

00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:47.745 line:85.83%,end
Why?

00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:49.913 line:85.83%,end
How would I know?

00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:53.459 line:85.83%,end
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:56.211 line:85.83%,end
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:57.963 line:85.83%,end
But why did she

00:45:58.046 --> 00:46:01.467 line:85.83%,end
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:05.220 line:85.83%,end
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.764 line:85.83%,end
I don't know.

00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:09.391 line:85.83%,end
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:11.810 line:85.83%,end
Anyway,

00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:15.272 line:85.83%,end
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:20.986 line:85.83%,end
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:43.425 line:85.83%,end
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:49.473 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:51.183 line:85.83%,end
Yes?

00:46:51.266 --> 00:46:52.935 line:85.83%,end
Showing off your drawing skills?

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:54.436 line:85.83%,end
Is that it?

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.021 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:46:57.105 --> 00:46:58.857 line:85.83%,end
Add a scar or something.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.235 line:85.83%,end
Right here.

00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:03.028 line:85.83%,end
A scar? What for?

00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:15.415 line:85.83%,end
You drew him well. It's very similar.

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:16.542 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:19.002 line:85.83%,end
We're not using it to catch him.

00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:21.088 line:85.83%,end
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:23.423 line:85.83%,end
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.592 line:85.83%,end
We need the other guys to look scary

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.053 line:85.83%,end
to make them look like bad guys.

00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:34.309 line:85.83%,end
What's that?

00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:38.856 line:85.83%,end
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:42.109 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:43.861 line:85.83%,end
That's right.

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:53.078 line:85.83%,end
ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

00:47:53.161 --> 00:47:54.162 line:85.83%,end
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:58.375 line:85.83%,end
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethalâ€¦

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:02.087 line:85.83%,end
Lethal.

00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:03.839 line:85.83%,end
Lethal.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.344 line:85.83%,end
You don't even knock now?

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.269 line:85.83%,end
Aren't you worried about the students?

00:48:17.352 --> 00:48:20.522 line:85.83%,end
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

00:48:21.106 --> 00:48:23.734 line:85.83%,end
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:25.444 line:85.83%,end
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:28.572 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.950 line:85.83%,end
Don't go against the flow.

00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:34.202 line:85.83%,end
We do what we're told

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.039 line:85.83%,end
without question. Absolute obedience.

00:48:38.957 --> 00:48:39.917 line:85.83%,end
The detonator?

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.337 line:85.83%,end
The director's daughter is in there.

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.256 line:85.83%,end
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.509 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean?

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.511 line:85.83%,end
It's better for you not to know.

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.805 line:85.83%,end
What you don't know won't hurt you.

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.724 line:85.83%,end
Stop bothering me.

00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.728 line:85.83%,end
Lethal.

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.648 line:85.83%,end
He's here again.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.362 line:85.83%,end
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.405 line:85.83%,end
That bastard.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.827 line:85.83%,end
He's here!

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.922 line:85.83%,end
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:29.299 line:85.83%,end
Before the announcement,

00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:31.927 line:85.83%,end
I pray for the souls of

00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:34.304 line:85.83%,end
the late Eun Yeong-u,

00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:36.515 line:85.83%,end
the son of director Eun,

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:39.643 line:85.83%,end
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:43.772 line:85.83%,end
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:51.113 line:85.83%,end
Now,

00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:55.158 line:85.83%,end
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

00:49:56.159 --> 00:50:00.872 line:85.83%,end
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:02.874 line:85.83%,end
came to Korea early this year.

00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:04.626 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.463 line:85.83%,end
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:12.175 line:85.83%,end
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:16.930 line:85.83%,end
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:22.811 line:85.83%,end
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.731 line:85.83%,end
So we started chasing those two.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:34.114 line:85.83%,end
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:37.743 line:85.83%,end
Want to dig into it?

00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:39.202 line:85.83%,end
A case?

00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:42.330 line:85.83%,end
What kind of case?

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.668 line:85.83%,end
Here! Take photos of these.
