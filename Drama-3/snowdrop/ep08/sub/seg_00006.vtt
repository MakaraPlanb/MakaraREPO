00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.169 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.

00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:39.754 line:85.83%,end
What? Okay.

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:47.011 line:85.83%,end
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:50.348 line:85.83%,end
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:58.481 line:85.83%,end
Be strong.

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:04.988 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:09.409 line:85.83%,end
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:12.036 line:85.83%,end
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:15.582 line:85.83%,end
They just lost their child.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.213 line:85.83%,end
Right.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:26.092 line:85.83%,end
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.096 line:85.83%,end
Yes,

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:33.433 line:85.83%,end
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:37.812 line:85.83%,end
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.022 line:85.83%,end
-Stop it.
-It's just…

00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:43.651 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:45.904 line:85.83%,end
Stay strong.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.333 line:85.83%,end
Let's go.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.799 line:85.83%,end
I can't believe you!

00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:07.884 line:85.83%,end
I just…

00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:13.222 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:17.769 line:85.83%,end
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.813 line:85.83%,end
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.483 line:85.83%,end
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:24.734 line:85.83%,end
That's enough!

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.862 line:85.83%,end
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:28.947 line:85.83%,end
I mean,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.618 line:85.83%,end
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:34.994 line:85.83%,end
What a sly snake.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:38.915 line:85.83%,end
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:43.544 line:85.83%,end
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.339 line:85.83%,end
Wait.

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:50.343 line:85.83%,end
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:58.267 line:85.83%,end
What do I do with you?

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:02.480 line:85.83%,end
Eun's wife caught on quick.

00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:04.440 line:85.83%,end
You seriously don't know?

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:06.943 line:85.83%,end
What other than the hostage situation?

00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:11.531 line:85.83%,end
You'll use the hostage-taking?

00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:15.868 line:85.83%,end
But what if something
happens to the students?

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:16.869 line:85.83%,end
Do you think--

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.081 line:85.83%,end
That's not important right now!

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:24.585 line:85.83%,end
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:28.464 line:85.83%,end
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:30.925 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.014 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.311 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry about a thing.

00:33:43.604 --> 00:33:46.649 line:85.83%,end
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:49.027 line:85.83%,end
unless 13 people die,

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.779 line:85.83%,end
it'll be all for nothing.

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:58.077 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:05.209 line:85.83%,end
For Eun to become president,

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:09.672 line:85.83%,end
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:12.633 line:85.83%,end
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.720 line:85.83%,end
He's not just any fortuneteller.

00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:20.308 line:85.83%,end
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:24.645 line:85.83%,end
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:27.774 line:85.83%,end
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:29.609 line:85.83%,end
I told you never to talk about it!

00:34:29.692 --> 00:34:32.487 line:85.83%,end
How many times must I tell you?

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.739 line:85.83%,end
Right.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.783 line:85.83%,end
Gosh.

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:41.120 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, honey.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.083 line:85.83%,end
I forgot.

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:51.047 line:85.83%,end
You must want to screw me over.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.840 line:85.83%,end
There's no other explanation.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.258 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.181 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:02.475 line:85.83%,end
That little sly minx.

00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:10.942 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:14.987 line:85.83%,end
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:18.157 line:85.83%,end
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:19.534 line:85.83%,end
No!

00:35:20.993 --> 00:35:23.329 line:85.83%,end
You should leave out the protesting part.

00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:27.083 line:85.83%,end
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:29.961 line:85.83%,end
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:31.963 line:85.83%,end
I understand, ma'am.

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:37.009 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:39.637 line:85.83%,end
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>
