01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:44.409 line:85.83%,end
<i>Then…</i>

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.705 line:85.83%,end
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.000 line:85.83%,end
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.755 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.554 line:85.83%,end
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

01:19:30.974 --> 01:19:32.058 line:85.83%,end
Don't do anything.

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:33.810 line:85.83%,end
You bastard.

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:36.313 line:85.83%,end
Don't you dare touch her!

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:44.279 line:85.83%,end
You think you can get out of here alive?

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:48.575 line:85.83%,end
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:53.538 line:85.83%,end
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.417 line:85.83%,end
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:02.380 line:85.83%,end
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:06.593 line:85.83%,end
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:09.387 line:85.83%,end
Of course, the latter would be better.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.224 line:85.83%,end
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:17.604 line:85.83%,end
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:20.357 line:85.83%,end
You think that makes sense?

01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:26.530 line:85.83%,end
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.283 line:85.83%,end
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:34.996 line:85.83%,end
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.333 line:85.83%,end
But my country is different.

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:41.253 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:44.256 line:85.83%,end
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

01:20:45.882 --> 01:20:48.260 line:85.83%,end
The party considers the people
as its children.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.971 line:85.83%,end
They'd never abandon us.

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:55.392 line:85.83%,end
Look.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.645 line:85.83%,end
Wake up, will you?

01:20:59.062 --> 01:21:00.730 line:85.83%,end
You still don't get it.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.149 line:85.83%,end
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.362 line:85.83%,end
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:18.373 line:85.83%,end
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.252 line:85.83%,end
I'll gladly be one.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:33.555 line:85.83%,end
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

01:21:33.638 --> 01:21:35.265 line:85.83%,end
in the dorm you can see,

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:37.559 line:85.83%,end
64 hostages, including female students,

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:40.937 line:85.83%,end
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.148 line:85.83%,end
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.150 line:85.83%,end
people fear for their safety.

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:02.876 line:85.83%,end
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.169 line:85.83%,end
<i>this is</i>

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.256 line:85.83%,end
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.636 line:85.83%,end
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.764 line:85.83%,end
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.433 line:85.83%,end
<i>to use and throw away.</i>
