01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.457 line:85.83%,end
Just keep working.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.422 line:85.83%,end
Hey! You did such a good job!

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.467 line:85.83%,end
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:12.843 line:85.83%,end
I'm flattered.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.598 line:85.83%,end
These are things they're demanding.

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.266 line:85.83%,end
Get them ready

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:23.104 line:85.83%,end
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.940 line:85.83%,end
You mean Jang Han-na?

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.276 line:85.83%,end
But she's enraged right now.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.237 line:85.83%,end
How about we send another agent?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.947 line:85.83%,end
That bastard said it must be her.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.283 line:85.83%,end
He specifically told me to send her.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:40.287 line:85.83%,end
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:41.747 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir.

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:46.335 line:85.83%,end
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.629 line:85.83%,end
things have been going smoothly.

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:52.008 line:85.83%,end
That goes without saying.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:54.343 line:85.83%,end
Now,

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.223 line:85.83%,end
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.059 line:85.83%,end
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:04.729 line:85.83%,end
Do you mean me?

01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:10.067 line:85.83%,end
Right away.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.324 line:85.83%,end
This is so nice.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.410 line:85.83%,end
It really is.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:57.281 line:85.83%,end
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:02.745 line:85.83%,end
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:05.581 line:85.83%,end
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:09.710 line:85.83%,end
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:12.046 line:85.83%,end
I'll turn my life around here!

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:14.423 line:85.83%,end
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:15.841 line:85.83%,end
Tell me how you will.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.345 line:85.83%,end
You don't need to know.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.930 line:85.83%,end
Just get out of here alone.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:24.517 line:85.83%,end
How can I possibly leave without you?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.019 line:85.83%,end
God, this is driving me crazy.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:30.606 line:85.83%,end
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.109 line:85.83%,end
So stop getting in my way

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.985 line:85.83%,end
and just go!

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.866 line:85.83%,end
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:24.410 line:85.83%,end
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

01:09:25.369 --> 01:09:27.288 line:85.83%,end
SWAT team, follow me!

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.041 line:85.83%,end
A situation occurred.

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:35.004 line:85.83%,end
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

01:09:41.218 --> 01:09:42.720 line:85.83%,end
Make him go back in right now.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:45.222 line:85.83%,end
Make him go back in! At all cost!

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.816 line:85.83%,end
Follow me now!

01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:02.573 line:85.83%,end
We received an order. Go back in.

01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:05.868 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell gave such an order?

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:14.835 line:85.83%,end
The exit.

01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:20.382 line:85.83%,end
You crazy bastards!

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.349 line:85.83%,end
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.605 line:85.83%,end
Go back in. It's an order.

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:40.986 line:85.83%,end
Go back in!
