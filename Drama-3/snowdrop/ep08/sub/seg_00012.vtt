Sang-beom.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.662 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.920 line:85.83%,end
Please, sir.

01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:58.131 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:01.259 line:85.83%,end
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:04.262 line:85.83%,end
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:09.559 line:85.83%,end
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.852 line:85.83%,end
Come here, you fool.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:14.397 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom!

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.149 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom!

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.692 line:85.83%,end
How dare you!

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:21.779 line:85.83%,end
Please, sir! Are you okay?

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.327 line:85.83%,end
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.370 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.125 line:85.83%,end
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:40.506 line:85.83%,end
Please don't kill them! Please!

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:44.135 line:85.83%,end
Why are you doing this to us?

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:48.097 line:85.83%,end
Please don't kill them! Please!

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.307 line:85.83%,end
You bastard!

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.351 line:85.83%,end
Stop it, you s***!

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.270 line:85.83%,end
Stop it!

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.024 line:85.83%,end
You can't do that to an old man!

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.155 line:85.83%,end
Go ahead. Shoot me!

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.615 line:85.83%,end
Shoot me, you bastard!

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:06.532 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:07.575 line:85.83%,end
Go ahead.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.744 line:85.83%,end
Shoot. Shoot me!

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.708 line:85.83%,end
Shoot me, you bastard!

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.751 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo!

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.219 line:85.83%,end
Damn it!

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.234 line:85.83%,end
He tried to steal our money--

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.361 line:85.83%,end
Lock the three in the prayer room.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:01.546 line:85.83%,end
That hurts.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:19.981 line:85.83%,end
You idiot!

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:23.150 line:85.83%,end
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.695 line:85.83%,end
What on earth did you do this time?

01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:26.654 line:85.83%,end
Shut up.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.949 line:85.83%,end
It's all your fault

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.660 line:85.83%,end
I turned out this way.

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:33.661 line:85.83%,end
What?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.125 line:85.83%,end
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.960 line:85.83%,end
There are just three of them.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.795 line:85.83%,end
Can't they just snipe at them?

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:46.591 line:85.83%,end
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.470 line:85.83%,end
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.972 line:85.83%,end
Stop it, you idiot!

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.808 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:00.771 line:85.83%,end
-Hey.
-Yes?

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.690 line:85.83%,end
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

01:05:02.773 --> 01:05:05.109 line:85.83%,end
Untie me too. Untie me first!

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.320 line:85.83%,end
Listen, sir.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:10.031 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you a way out of here,

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:11.574 line:85.83%,end
so take him with you.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.368 line:85.83%,end
A way out of here?

01:05:14.952 --> 01:05:16.495 line:85.83%,end
Is there a way out?

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.084 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.045 line:85.83%,end
This way.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.549 line:85.83%,end
Here. This is the one.

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:34.263 line:85.83%,end
Where does this lead?

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.390 line:85.83%,end
If you go all the way down the stairs,

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:39.560 line:85.83%,end
you'll find the exit on basement two.
