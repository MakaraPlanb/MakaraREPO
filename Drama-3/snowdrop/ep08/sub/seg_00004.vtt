00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.750 line:85.83%,end
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.501 line:85.83%,end
but we never know

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.379 line:85.83%,end
how things will turn out and when.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.299 line:85.83%,end
You know that, right?

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.801 line:85.83%,end
Of course, ma'am.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.678 line:85.83%,end
So the ANSP director's daughter…

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.100 line:85.83%,end
hid you in this dorm?

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:29.770 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:37.194 line:85.83%,end
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:43.116 line:85.83%,end
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.665 line:85.83%,end
I never had any personal feelings for her.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.378 line:85.83%,end
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.182 line:85.83%,end
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.142 line:85.83%,end
but the news about it just broke out.

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.311 line:85.83%,end
And my face has been disclosed.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:16.108 line:85.83%,end
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.237 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:24.241 line:85.83%,end
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:26.451 line:85.83%,end
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:28.996 line:85.83%,end
I just don't trust the ANSP.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:30.831 line:85.83%,end
As I told you,

00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:34.793 line:85.83%,end
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:37.337 line:85.83%,end
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:43.093 line:85.83%,end
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:44.970 line:85.83%,end
Would the party really have

00:21:45.762 --> 00:21:48.181 line:85.83%,end
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.476 line:85.83%,end
Then…

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.855 line:85.83%,end
let me ask you one thing.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.070 line:85.83%,end
Why in ten days?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.990 line:85.83%,end
You seriously don't know?

00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:09.494 line:85.83%,end
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.160 line:85.83%,end
That's a bomb, isn't it?

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:54.873 line:85.83%,end
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.292 line:85.83%,end
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.337 line:85.83%,end
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

00:23:02.422 --> 00:23:05.175 line:85.83%,end
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:07.677 line:85.83%,end
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.096 line:85.83%,end
Keep it down.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:12.182 line:85.83%,end
He took her out of here in secret.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.309 line:85.83%,end
Stop talking nonsense.

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:17.479 line:85.83%,end
Get back to sleep.

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:20.565 line:85.83%,end
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:23.193 line:85.83%,end
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:24.611 line:85.83%,end
I saw it with my own eyes!

00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:25.821 line:85.83%,end
Gye Bun-ok.

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.699 line:85.83%,end
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.993 line:85.83%,end
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:34.579 line:85.83%,end
It's already been two hours.

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.165 line:85.83%,end
They must've released her. Right?

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.375 line:85.83%,end
Of course not.

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.879 line:85.83%,end
She passed out.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:47.217 line:85.83%,end
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.636 line:85.83%,end
Her brother died?

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.513 line:85.83%,end
I feel so bad for her.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.266 line:85.83%,end
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.112 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:10.115 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.118 line:85.83%,end
It's all my fault.

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:16.496 line:85.83%,end
I'm the one who got him killed.

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.959 line:85.83%,end
That's not your fault.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.879 line:85.83%,end
When you sent him to the front lines,

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:27.757 line:85.83%,end
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.802 line:85.83%,end
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:32.971 line:85.83%,end
Very enthusiastically, at that.

00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:36.558 line:85.83%,end
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:40.896 line:85.83%,end
Honey.

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.483 line:85.83%,end
I know it's really hard for you,

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:48.236 line:85.83%,end
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.407 line:85.83%,end
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:56.328 line:85.83%,end
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

00:24:58.455 --> 00:24:59.623 line:85.83%,end
If Code 1 finds out

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:02.334 line:85.83%,end
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:04.920 line:85.83%,end
Now that the operation has failed,

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.005 line:85.83%,end
if you're pushed out,

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.215 line:85.83%,end
what about Yeong-ro?
