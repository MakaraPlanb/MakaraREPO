The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.679 line:85.83%,end
of the opposition candidate for it?

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.140 line:85.83%,end
I told you.

00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:28.144 line:85.83%,end
In Professor Han's bag,

we found a letter
from his son in the North

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.316 line:85.83%,end
that says they should destroy

00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:35.109 line:85.83%,end
the pro-US candidate--

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.068 line:85.83%,end
No!

00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:39.488 line:85.83%,end
You can't get so worked up.

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:40.823 line:85.83%,end
Right.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.201 line:85.83%,end
I should relax.

00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:44.243 line:85.83%,end
Let me try it again.

00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:46.078 line:85.83%,end
Are you going to do this all night?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.831 line:85.83%,end
Look.

00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:52.335 line:85.83%,end
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.463 line:85.83%,end
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.298 line:85.83%,end
Of course, it must go perfectly!

00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:01.177 line:85.83%,end
Guys.

00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:05.848 line:85.83%,end
What should I wear tomorrow?

Here.

00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.333 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.464 line:85.83%,end
Or you'll collapse.

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:36.934 line:85.83%,end
I think he should be untied to eat this.
