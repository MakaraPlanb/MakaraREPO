00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.940 line:85.83%,end
-Untie him.
-Okay.

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:44.775 line:85.83%,end
Come on.

00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:50.739 line:85.83%,end
Hey, come eat.

00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:52.199 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.910 line:85.83%,end
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.329 line:85.83%,end
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.294 line:85.83%,end
This is for you. Come on.

00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:05.463 line:85.83%,end
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:11.051 line:85.83%,end
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:13.762 line:85.83%,end
Why don't you eat with me?

00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:45.628 line:85.83%,end
Did you sleep at all?

00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.756 line:85.83%,end
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.553 line:85.83%,end
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.683 line:85.83%,end
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:02.269 line:85.83%,end
this wouldn't be happening.

00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:06.023 line:85.83%,end
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:07.149 line:85.83%,end
Stop it.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.492 line:85.83%,end
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.453 line:85.83%,end
but I still don't get why

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:21.622 line:85.83%,end
she stopped us from searching like that.

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:24.375 line:85.83%,end
I found that weird too.

00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:28.712 line:85.83%,end
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:30.756 line:85.83%,end
What if he harmed the kids?

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.509 line:85.83%,end
She should've been scared
and let you search.

00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:38.180 line:85.83%,end
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:44.019 line:85.83%,end
There are many?

00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:47.648 line:85.83%,end
Yes. Once a month,

00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:51.193 line:85.83%,end
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.362 line:85.83%,end
Stop talking nonsense.

00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:54.363 line:85.83%,end
Just eat.

00:42:54.446 --> 00:42:56.907 line:85.83%,end
You said you found it suspicious too.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.493 line:85.83%,end
Suspicious?

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.454 line:85.83%,end
Maybe she has no family.

00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:04.748 line:85.83%,end
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.375 line:85.83%,end
But once a month,

00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:11.922 line:85.83%,end
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:23.350 line:85.83%,end
<i>All exhausted?</i>

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.978 line:85.83%,end
Yes. That's not all.

00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:29.565 line:85.83%,end
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.899 line:85.83%,end
Hey, now.

00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:32.276 line:85.83%,end
Shut it.

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:35.321 line:85.83%,end
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

00:43:36.155 --> 00:43:38.115 line:85.83%,end
What on earth did you overhear?

00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:45.080 line:85.83%,end
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

00:43:46.665 --> 00:43:47.833 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi's picture.

00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:49.501 line:85.83%,end
Picture?

00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:56.634 line:85.83%,end
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.724 line:85.83%,end
Put him on right now!

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:05.851 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know who I am?

00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:07.519 line:85.83%,end
I'm still the hall director!

00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:13.233 line:85.83%,end
Sir.

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:18.447 line:85.83%,end
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:23.327 line:85.83%,end
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.704 line:85.83%,end
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

00:44:26.705 --> 00:44:28.832 line:85.83%,end
Can just anyone be in this position?

00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:33.504 line:85.83%,end
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:36.006 line:85.83%,end
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.635 line:85.83%,end
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.810 line:85.83%,end
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:50.938 line:85.83%,end
My cousin lives in Munich.

00:44:52.272 --> 00:44:53.691 line:85.83%,end
<i>My goodness.</i>

00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:57.945 line:85.83%,end
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

00:44:58.612 --> 00:45:02.074 line:85.83%,end
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

00:45:02.157 --> 00:45:04.785 line:85.83%,end
She's not good enough to be my successor.

00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:11.041 line:85.83%,end
I'm quitting, but I care.

00:45:12.292 --> 00:45:14.962 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell asked you to do this?

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.091 line:85.83%,end
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.970 line:85.83%,end
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.346 line:85.83%,end
Do you understand?

00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:27.599 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am.

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:38.110 line:85.83%,end
<i>And that night,</i>

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.697 line:85.83%,end
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>
