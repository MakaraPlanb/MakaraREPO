01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:05.605 line:85.83%,end
Why aren't they rescuing us?

01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:07.899 line:85.83%,end
Why aren't they trying anything?

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:10.610 line:85.83%,end
You are

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:13.697 line:85.83%,end
the director's daughter, right?

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:18.243 line:85.83%,end
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:20.704 line:85.83%,end
What do I need to do?

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:22.664 line:85.83%,end
Help me. Please.

01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:30.255 line:85.83%,end
Don't act rashly.

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:34.092 line:85.83%,end
He has a detonator in his pocket.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.219 line:85.83%,end
If he pushes the button,

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.889 line:85.83%,end
the whole dorm will explode.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:48.231 line:85.83%,end
I know it's hard, but be patient.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.734 line:85.83%,end
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:54.821 line:85.83%,end
I just wanted to give him bread.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:06.541 line:85.83%,end
I need

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.626 line:85.83%,end
to go to the restroom.

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.962 line:85.83%,end
Can I go?

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:27.020 line:85.83%,end
Make it quick.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.946 line:85.83%,end
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:41.951 line:85.83%,end
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:11.648 line:85.83%,end
Please

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:14.400 line:85.83%,end
let me rest a bit.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.158 line:85.83%,end
Follow me.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.672 line:85.83%,end
You didn't answer my question.

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.303 line:85.83%,end
That paper airplaneâ€¦

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:46.099 line:85.83%,end
That's the one I flew out.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:50.103 line:85.83%,end
Why do you have it?

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.860 line:85.83%,end
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.323 line:85.83%,end
I just found it while being chased.

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.450 line:85.83%,end
Get some rest here.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:08.329 line:85.83%,end
Then why did you come back?

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.250 line:85.83%,end
You should've just left.

01:26:13.626 --> 01:26:15.670 line:85.83%,end
Why did you come back here?

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:29.309 line:85.83%,end
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:35.148 line:85.83%,end
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:40.445 line:85.83%,end
I would never have gone in.

01:26:50.955 --> 01:26:52.081 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorryâ€¦

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.294 line:85.83%,end
about your brother.

01:27:07.096 --> 01:27:08.097 line:85.83%,end
We will

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:11.184 line:85.83%,end
leave in nine days.

01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:15.980 line:85.83%,end
All this will be over in nine days.

01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:20.985 line:85.83%,end
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

01:27:21.527 --> 01:27:24.072 line:85.83%,end
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:27.325 line:85.83%,end
I want to

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:31.454 line:85.83%,end
release you right now.

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.087 line:85.83%,end
But I can't.
