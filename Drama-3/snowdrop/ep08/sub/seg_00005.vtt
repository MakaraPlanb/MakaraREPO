We can't bring Yeong-u back,

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.719 line:85.83%,end
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.347 line:85.83%,end
I know you made a deal with the North,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.851 line:85.83%,end
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:22.229 line:85.83%,end
Honey!

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.774 line:85.83%,end
You must pull yourself together!

00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.985 line:85.83%,end
I know. I know that.

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:30.987 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u…

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.864 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u…

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:38.703 line:85.83%,end
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.623 line:85.83%,end
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:45.085 line:85.83%,end
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.170 line:85.83%,end
I'm just three years younger than you.

00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.471 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u!

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.184 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u!

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:04.521 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u!

00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:08.483 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u…

00:26:10.777 --> 00:26:11.987 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u!

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.951 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u…

00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:20.704 line:85.83%,end
Get it together.

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:23.957 line:85.83%,end
My brother

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:25.917 line:85.83%,end
is gone.

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:30.005 line:85.83%,end
You must've had a nightmare.

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:31.881 line:85.83%,end
Don't you remember

00:26:32.465 --> 00:26:33.550 line:85.83%,end
passing out?

00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:53.028 line:85.83%,end
It's all right.

00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:54.029 line:85.83%,end
It's okay.

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.198 line:85.83%,end
All right, breathe in again.

00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:01.911 line:85.83%,end
It's okay.

00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:09.210 line:85.83%,end
<i>Wait.</i>

00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:15.091 line:85.83%,end
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:24.768 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry,

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:29.898 line:85.83%,end
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:36.488 line:85.83%,end
They must be mistaken.

00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:38.698 line:85.83%,end
Maybe someone by the same name.

00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.666 line:85.83%,end
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:33.086 line:85.83%,end
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:35.088 line:85.83%,end
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:39.050 line:85.83%,end
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:42.512 line:85.83%,end
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:46.599 line:85.83%,end
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.019 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.257 line:85.83%,end
Go back to the room.

00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:27.056 line:85.83%,end
Go back to the room.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.018 line:85.83%,end
Let me go.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.857 line:85.83%,end
Let me out.

00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:44.491 line:85.83%,end
My brother…

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:50.205 line:85.83%,end
I want to go see my brother.

00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.044 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.922 line:85.83%,end
Please let me see him one last time.
