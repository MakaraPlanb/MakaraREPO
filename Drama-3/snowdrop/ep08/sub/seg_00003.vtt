<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.285 line:85.83%,end
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:13.162 line:85.83%,end
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:16.498 line:85.83%,end
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:21.045 line:85.83%,end
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.885 line:85.83%,end
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:30.888 line:85.83%,end
<i>A bomb?</i>

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:33.682 line:85.83%,end
If they try to deceive us again,

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.519 line:85.83%,end
I'll push the button.

00:16:58.308 --> 00:17:00.853 line:85.83%,end
Talk about bad timing.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.230 line:85.83%,end
If only you'd come in a bit later.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:05.816 line:85.83%,end
Turn around.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.177 line:85.83%,end
That…

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.846 line:85.83%,end
Why is that…

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.366 line:85.83%,end
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.994 line:85.83%,end
Don't try anything funny.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.330 line:85.83%,end
Will you blow everyone up?

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:05.834 line:85.83%,end
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.172 line:85.83%,end
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.427 line:85.83%,end
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.269 line:85.83%,end
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.313 line:85.83%,end
I won't let it slide twice.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:29.942 line:85.83%,end
"That woman"? Who?

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:35.906 line:85.83%,end
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.450 line:85.83%,end
Just colleagues.

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.259 line:85.83%,end
Go in.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:24.705 line:85.83%,end
How is she?

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.124 line:85.83%,end
I gave her a tranquilizer,

00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:29.793 line:85.83%,end
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.724 line:85.83%,end
Can we have a word for a minute?
