EPISODE 8

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:18.912 line:14.17%,start
Hello?

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.164 line:14.17%,start
Yes. And?

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.542 line:14.17%,start
What? What are you talking about?

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.295 line:14.17%,start
Eun Yeong-u?

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.799 line:14.17%,start
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.977 line:14.17%,start
What? Where is he going?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.902 line:85.83%,end
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.622 line:85.83%,end
You're good at that.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:03.665 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.716 line:85.83%,end
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.011 line:85.83%,end
I thought you weren't coming today.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.265 line:85.83%,end
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.436 line:85.83%,end
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.773 line:85.83%,end
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.358 line:85.83%,end
to give them some food.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.407 line:85.83%,end
Could you step aside?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:45.456 line:85.83%,end
Step aside?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.264 line:85.83%,end
Or I will for you.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.896 line:85.83%,end
Ma'am, this is bad.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.023 line:85.83%,end
It's Yeong-u.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.610 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.322 line:85.83%,end
My son is?

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:18.740 line:85.83%,end
Where's my husband?

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.658 line:85.83%,end
He's at the hospital.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.870 line:85.83%,end
That rude wench.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.748 line:85.83%,end
Did she just leave without saying bye?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.542 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry, sir.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:32.128 line:85.83%,end
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.214 line:85.83%,end
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.758 line:85.83%,end
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:40.803 line:85.83%,end
This way, sir.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:46.184 line:85.83%,end
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.067 line:85.83%,end
Good work, guys.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.616 line:85.83%,end
He's asleep, right?

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.076 line:85.83%,end
We gave him a sedative.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.084 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-u.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.753 line:85.83%,end
I shouldn't have let them

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.089 line:85.83%,end
assign you to the front lines.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.515 line:85.83%,end
Dad.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.058 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.186 line:85.83%,end
I…

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.731 line:85.83%,end
promised Mom…

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.109 line:85.83%,end
Mom?

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.156 line:85.83%,end
…that I would protect…

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:49.998 line:85.83%,end
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.667 line:85.83%,end
<i>Mom.</i>

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.421 line:85.83%,end
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.673 line:85.83%,end
So don't worry.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.718 line:85.83%,end
I'll make sure she marries
