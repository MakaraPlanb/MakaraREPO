01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:43.150 line:85.83%,end
Sir, please.

01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:45.611 line:85.83%,end
Please, sir.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.404 line:85.83%,end
Please don't kill him.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.533 line:85.83%,end
How did that bastard get out?

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.080 line:85.83%,end
I'll tell you.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:58.457 line:85.83%,end
He got out through here. This way.

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:07.299 line:85.83%,end
Here.

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.339 line:85.83%,end
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:49.883 line:85.83%,end
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:54.012 line:85.83%,end
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:55.597 line:85.83%,end
The doctor?

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:59.726 line:85.83%,end
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.564 line:85.83%,end
Does it have to do with it?

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.777 line:85.83%,end
For the ruling party to regain power,

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.114 line:85.83%,end
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:15.200 line:85.83%,end
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.786 line:85.83%,end
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:26.378 line:85.83%,end
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.756 line:85.83%,end
It's taken me

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.468 line:85.83%,end
as many as 17 years to come this far.

01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:36.138 line:85.83%,end
Only a handful of people

01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:40.058 line:85.83%,end
know who I really am, even in the North.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:45.230 line:85.83%,end
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.066 line:85.83%,end
proves how much you mean to the party.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.693 line:85.83%,end
Can't you see that?

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:56.909 line:85.83%,end
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.660 line:85.83%,end
The doctor is what?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.705 line:85.83%,end
The doctor the agency sent in…

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.958 line:85.83%,end
is a Northern spy?

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.848 line:85.83%,end
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:25.229 line:85.83%,end
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:33.445 line:85.83%,end
And this hostage-taking too?

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.595 line:85.83%,end
Go back to your seats!

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.223 line:85.83%,end
What was the gunfire about?

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:03.642 line:85.83%,end
You want us to all die?

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:08.230 line:85.83%,end
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.942 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:14.194 line:85.83%,end
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.572 line:85.83%,end
You made him come back in?

01:16:17.614 --> 01:16:18.490 line:85.83%,end
Why?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.950 line:85.83%,end
Why do you think?

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.954 line:85.83%,end
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:27.291 line:85.83%,end
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:29.209 line:85.83%,end
He'll be a pain in the neck.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:32.379 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:34.506 line:85.83%,end
the ANSP director's son of all people?

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:38.468 line:85.83%,end
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:43.265 line:85.83%,end
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:53.942 line:85.83%,end
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:56.862 line:85.83%,end
Hold out for nine more days,

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.781 line:85.83%,end
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:27.017 line:85.83%,end
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.811 line:85.83%,end
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:32.689 line:85.83%,end
<i>to the North?</i>

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.861 line:85.83%,end
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:41.531 line:85.83%,end
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>
