No. Don't go.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:43.920 line:85.83%,end
If this button is pushed,

01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:47.632 line:85.83%,end
the dorm will explode.

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:50.218 line:85.83%,end
Right?

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.148 line:85.83%,end
Eun Yeong-ro!

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.985 line:85.83%,end
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.863 line:85.83%,end
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:12.198 line:85.83%,end
You really think so?

01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:14.700 line:85.83%,end
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:17.161 line:85.83%,end
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.288 line:85.83%,end
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:23.167 line:14.17%,start
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.378 line:14.17%,start
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:26.879 line:14.17%,start
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:29.549 line:14.17%,start
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

01:30:29.632 --> 01:30:31.300 line:14.17%,start
planning to kill the students, are they?

01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:34.429 line:14.17%,start
Let's save the students together.

01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:37.181 line:14.17%,start
How about you use me?

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:40.309 line:14.17%,start
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:43.187 line:14.17%,start
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.397 line:14.17%,start
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:49.819 line:14.17%,start
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:58.411 line:85.83%,end
BONUS

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:04.375 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, close the door.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.127 line:85.83%,end
Pi might smell it and wake up.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.343 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:16.512 line:85.83%,end
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:18.055 line:85.83%,end
Fine. Hurry up.

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:23.186 line:85.83%,end
Hey, your partner is really hot.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:25.146 line:85.83%,end
Set me up with his friend.

01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:26.981 line:85.83%,end
Yes. Set me up too.

01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:29.734 line:85.83%,end
-Please?
-Please?

01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:33.488 line:85.83%,end
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:35.364 line:85.83%,end
-Great!
-Great!

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:38.701 line:85.83%,end
His friends? He's being chased--

01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:48.669 line:85.83%,end
I haven't seen that necklace before.

01:31:50.963 --> 01:31:52.840 line:85.83%,end
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.847 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.641 line:85.83%,end
Good for you!

01:32:03.142 --> 01:32:04.602 line:85.83%,end
That's pretty. What bird is it?

01:32:05.436 --> 01:32:06.646 line:85.83%,end
A dove.

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:09.106 line:85.83%,end
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.
