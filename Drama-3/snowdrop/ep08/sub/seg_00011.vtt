00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.603 line:85.83%,end
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.398 line:85.83%,end
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:03.443 line:85.83%,end
How could we not be included in those 30?

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.862 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:08.698 line:85.83%,end
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:12.243 line:85.83%,end
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:15.663 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.001 line:85.83%,end
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

00:56:22.003 --> 00:56:25.799 line:85.83%,end
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.968 line:85.83%,end
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:31.304 line:85.83%,end
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.264 line:85.83%,end
but she's quite eloquent.

00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:36.393 line:85.83%,end
You guys obviously don't know her well.

00:56:37.143 --> 00:56:39.354 line:85.83%,end
Hey. Dream on.

00:56:40.772 --> 00:56:41.689 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:56:44.943 --> 00:56:46.111 line:85.83%,end
Go bring some water.

00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:48.863 line:85.83%,end
Hot water.

00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:56.162 line:85.83%,end
You.

00:56:57.497 --> 00:56:58.915 line:85.83%,end
Stay put.

00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:02.544 line:85.83%,end
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

00:57:04.003 --> 00:57:05.296 line:85.83%,end
You littleâ€¦

00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:16.933 line:85.83%,end
Don't take long!

00:58:11.362 --> 00:58:13.990 line:85.83%,end
Hold on. What's that?

00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:19.204 line:85.83%,end
Oh, my.

00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:21.372 line:85.83%,end
What's all this?

00:58:22.457 --> 00:58:23.625 line:85.83%,end
I knew it.

00:58:23.958 --> 00:58:25.460 line:85.83%,end
There's always a silver lining.

00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.129 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing?

00:58:39.724 --> 00:58:43.269 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.688 line:85.83%,end
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:47.440 line:85.83%,end
How can I ignore this?

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.693 line:85.83%,end
How will they know who took it?

00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:52.654 line:85.83%,end
I'll just play dumb.

00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:54.030 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:58:56.324 --> 00:58:57.408 line:85.83%,end
Of course, they'll know.

00:58:57.992 --> 00:59:00.537 line:85.83%,end
Because I'll tell them you took it.

00:59:01.746 --> 00:59:03.081 line:85.83%,end
Bun-ok.

00:59:03.164 --> 00:59:05.208 line:85.83%,end
How could you say that?

00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:09.629 line:85.83%,end
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:13.341 line:85.83%,end
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.561 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. Don't come near me.

00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:25.812 line:85.83%,end
Stay away.

00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:28.523 line:85.83%,end
Darn it.

00:59:50.503 --> 00:59:52.547 line:85.83%,end
I told you!

00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:55.842 line:85.83%,end
I told you not to do this.

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:59.304 line:85.83%,end
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.518 line:85.83%,end
That wench talked me into it.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.230 line:85.83%,end
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.320 line:85.83%,end
I didn't.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:18.239 line:85.83%,end
I really didn't.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.874 line:85.83%,end
That damn bastard.

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:32.128 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry.

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.008 line:85.83%,end
Sang-beom.

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:39.052 line:85.83%,end
What happened to your face?

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.557 line:85.83%,end
Please, sir.
