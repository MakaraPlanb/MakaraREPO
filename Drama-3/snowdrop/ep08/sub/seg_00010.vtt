These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:57.596 line:85.83%,end
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.226 line:85.83%,end
The Hosu hostage situation?

00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:05.771 line:85.83%,end
Without An knowing?

00:51:05.979 --> 00:51:09.983 line:85.83%,end
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:11.359 line:85.83%,end
Take it!

00:51:15.781 --> 00:51:17.491 line:85.83%,end
We won't give in

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:20.702 line:85.83%,end
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

00:51:20.786 --> 00:51:22.621 line:85.83%,end
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:27.000 line:85.83%,end
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:30.337 line:85.83%,end
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.464 line:85.83%,end
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:35.759 line:85.83%,end
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:41.348 line:85.83%,end
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:45.268 line:85.83%,end
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:47.562 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:51.775 line:85.83%,end
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

00:51:53.401 --> 00:51:54.694 line:85.83%,end
What about ten days later?

00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:58.657 line:85.83%,end
They just created four more spies.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.910 line:85.83%,end
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

00:52:06.039 --> 00:52:08.208 line:85.83%,end
Release half of the hostages.

00:52:09.876 --> 00:52:10.752 line:85.83%,end
Pardon?

00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:13.088 line:85.83%,end
If 30 hostages get released

00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:15.841 line:85.83%,end
and say there are only three spies,

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:17.592 line:85.83%,end
won't that be fun to watch?

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.972 line:85.83%,end
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.186 line:85.83%,end
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.397 line:85.83%,end
Is there anyone you want to release?

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:44.327 line:85.83%,end
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.739 line:85.83%,end
We don't intend to hurt you.

00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:24.284 line:85.83%,end
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.661 line:85.83%,end
To prove that, I will

00:53:28.788 --> 00:53:30.290 line:85.83%,end
release 30 of you today.

00:53:33.418 --> 00:53:34.502 line:85.83%,end
Quiet!

00:53:37.964 --> 00:53:39.174 line:85.83%,end
Ms. Pi.

00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:41.801 line:85.83%,end
This is the list of those I'll release.

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.762 line:85.83%,end
Call their names.

00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:50.602 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro.

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.937 line:85.83%,end
I think they'll release you.

00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:54.397 line:85.83%,end
I hope they'll release us too.

00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:56.024 line:85.83%,end
Please.

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:00.237 line:85.83%,end
Je Min-gyeong.

00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:02.489 line:85.83%,end
Finally!

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:03.865 line:85.83%,end
Kim Bit-ni.

00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:05.158 line:85.83%,end
-Hey!
-Me?

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:06.785 line:85.83%,end
Yang Hye-ji.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.579 line:85.83%,end
Kim Dong-hui.

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:12.499 line:85.83%,end
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:15.418 line:85.83%,end
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

00:54:16.878 --> 00:54:18.546 line:85.83%,end
30 people right away?

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.798 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.549 line:85.83%,end
You don't want them?

00:54:22.884 --> 00:54:26.054 line:85.83%,end
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:29.391 line:85.83%,end
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.894 line:85.83%,end
In return, send in things we demand.

00:54:32.978 --> 00:54:34.062 line:85.83%,end
Hey, wait!

00:54:35.146 --> 00:54:37.232 line:85.83%,end
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:39.818 line:85.83%,end
We'll send in anything you need.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:41.861 line:85.83%,end
And

00:54:42.862 --> 00:54:44.030 line:85.83%,end
Dr. Kang…

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.575 line:85.83%,end
Release her right now.

00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:50.829 line:85.83%,end
She won't be released.

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.082 line:85.83%,end
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.168 line:85.83%,end
What? A gun?

00:54:58.878 --> 00:54:59.713 line:85.83%,end
You…

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:02.465 line:85.83%,end
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:06.678 line:85.83%,end
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:10.390 line:85.83%,end
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:17.397 line:85.83%,end
Some cup noodles too.

00:55:24.362 --> 00:55:25.655 line:85.83%,end
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:30.618 line:85.83%,end
Hello?

00:55:30.702 --> 00:55:34.331 line:85.83%,end
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:35.332 line:85.83%,end
Cup noodles.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.002 line:85.83%,end
But what kind of cup noodles?
