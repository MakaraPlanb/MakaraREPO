00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,550
What do you want to say?

189
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,710

190
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
I'm not nervous.

191

If you want,

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,510
let's pick a good day to get married.

194
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,350
This...

195
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,590
It's too hot. The tea is too hot.

196
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,990
Niaoniao.

197
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,100
Theses days I've seen

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,420
what happened to Qingfeng and the officer,

199
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,870
and I've figured it out.

200
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,990
Since I like you,

201
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,990
I should be brave enough to take that step.

202
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,870
If you want,

203
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,310
I will be good to you in a lifetime.

204
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,630
If you don't want to,

205
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,470
it doesn't matter.

206
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,590
I‘ll wait for you.

207
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,110
It's not that I don't want to.

208
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,110
It's just...

209
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,390
Just what?

210
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,550
I just want to know

211

what you like about me.

212
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,590
I like

213

your fortitude and elegance.

214
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,150
If I have to use a flower to describe it,

215
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,070
it would be

216
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,550
plum blossom.

217
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,550
"Not angling for good looks,

218
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,110
you'd be content to let your integrity fill the universe."

219
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,470
You...You said I didn't have good looks?

220
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,980
I didn't mean that.

221
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,390
I...Let me use another verse.

222
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,510
You are...

223
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,230
"You are as beautiful as peach blossoms in March,

224
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,270
as pure as the chrysanthemum in September."

225
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,830
Both your appearance and temperament

226
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,350
are just like a fairy's,

227
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,670

228
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,070
I think you are just trying to cheer me up.

229
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,910
And those verses you said

230
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,150
were probably just memorized

231
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,110
as they were that night in the poem club.

232
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,390
No, I mean it.

233
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,750
Then I won't use verses.

234
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,310

235
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,830
in the simplest and most understandable way.

236
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,750
You are the kindest, bravest,

237
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,270
and most admirable woman I've ever met.

238
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,750
Although you stand aloof from worldly success,

239
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,750
you have your own persistence.

240
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,220
This style is absolutely unique.

241
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,150
Am I really as good as you say?

242
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,070
Yes.

243
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,030

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,030
to extend Fengjiang Tower together.

374
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,230
I asked around.

375
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,430
It’s Her Highness’s instruction.

376
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,790
I think

377
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,670
Miss Zhao must have persuaded the princess.

378
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,790
Speaking of which,

379
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,270
Luo, I already knew.

380
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,190
Tell me

381
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,220
what happened.

382
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,790
I knew

383
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,030
I couldn't hide anything from you.

384
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,430
You and I are both men of misfortune.

385
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,110
What do you mean?

386
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,990
Niaoniao's father came from Yangzhou.

387
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,230
He took her back to Yangzhou to get married.

388
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,950
I can send someone

389
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,630
to find out what's going on with Miss Han.

390
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,550
We don’t know the inside story.

391
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,950
We’d better not act rashly.

392
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,420
We'll figure it out tomorrow

393
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,510
when Luo sobers up.

394
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,470
Li Qingfeng,

395
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,150
what did you and Wang Sheng do last night?

396
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,950
Why are you so listless in the morning?

397
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,310
Today is the day that Master returns to Wood Feather.

398
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,110
Can't you be more enthusiastic?

399
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,110
Not to mention them,

400
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,510
when we got a job in the past,

401
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,190
Boss Luo was always the most active.

402
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,710
But now he's not awake yet.

403
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,540
Who knows what unpresentable things these three men did

404
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,300
in the middle of the night.

405
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,990
That...That is too improper.

406
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,470
Why didn't they call me?

407
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,470
Good morning, everyone.

408
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,870
Your Highness.

409
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,030
Pass the courtesy.

410
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,150
And don’t call me Your Highness anymore.

411
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,390
Master. Luo.

412
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,270
Where are Boss Luo and Niaoniao?

413
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,950
Niaoniao's father came to the Wood Feather House

414
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,510
and took her back to Yangzhou.

415
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,190
Where is Boss Luo?

416
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,990
Did he go with them?

417
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,230
He‘s not awake yet

418
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,230
after drinking all night.

419
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,860
Luo Ye,

420
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,180
what a loser!

421
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,150
I'm telling the truth.

422
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,190
Brother,

423
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,150
you are really a loser.

424
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,990
Stop talking, sir.

425
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,150
Luo is like this now.

426
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,830
He is right.

427
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,910
I'm indeed a loser.

428
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,270
I...I...

429
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,150
Now that the princess is back,

430
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,750
let's not talk about private matters.

431
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,950
Let's just talk about work.

432
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,750
OK.

433
00:23:59,390 --> 00:23:59,830
Luo,

434
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,590
bring out the draft.

435
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,350
The job this time is to build a new tower,

436
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,350
which is one of the three auxiliary towers.

437
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,190
I drew six drafts in total.

438
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,070
You can have a look.

439
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,270
This tower is called Sanjun Tower,

440
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,950
which is dedicated to the memory of Xiao's martyrs.

441
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,150
At that time, the tower will enshrine

442
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,230
all the heroic tablets with outstanding military achievements.

443
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,670
I am in full charge of this job.

444
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,270
It is not just my dream job.

445
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,220
It also represents responsibility and honor.

446
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,950
So we cannot afford to make any mistake.

447
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,910
Since you are back,

448
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,630
let's do our preliminary preparation work

449
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,390
here.

450
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,630
I've collected all your stuff.

451
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,070
It's all in this box.

452
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,270
So, as soon as I left,

453
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,510
you put away my stuff.

454
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,710
Exactly.

455
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,630
I'm just as heartless as you said.

456
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,670
So I want to keep your stuff

457
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,030
in the Wood Feather for a long time.

458
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,270
Your Highness, you might as well

459
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,510
stay here.

460
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,540
Qingfeng.

461
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,230
I don't know how to explain.

462
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,950
But about the marriage,

463
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,950
there is no turning back.

464
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,470
Then don't say it.

465
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,030
You're tired of talking. I'm tired of hearing it.

466
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,390
Why don't we just pretend that

467
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,750
nothing happened

468
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,270
and concentrate on doing the job well?

469
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,270
Qingfeng.

470
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,110
Langyue, trust me, will you?

471
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,310
Li Qingfeng.

472
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,150
What is it?

473
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,350
Boss Luo just left the House alone.

474
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,590
I'm afraid something might happen to him,

475
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,990
so I asked Meng Yuanxu to follow him.

476
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,470
But I think it would be better

477
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,950
if you could talk to him on this matter.

478
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,350
Is it about Niaoniao?

479
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,790
Yes.

480
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,030
Luo Ye

481
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,870
usually seems to

482
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,350
have nothing to worry about,

483
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,270
but this time is really different.

484
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,150
We didn't expect

485
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,310
Niaoniao to leave here and return to Yangzhou.

486
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,270
If Fengjiang Tower weren't so urgent,

487
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,950
we should

488
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,510
bring her back together.

489
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,750
Luo Ye has to do it himself.

490
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,790
Even without the job of Fengjiang Tower,

491
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,550
it doesn't make much sense

492
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,060
for us to go there.

493
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,790
So you mean...

494
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,270
I'll go find Luo Ye first.

495
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,510
By the way,

496
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,790
I asked Meng Yuanxu to leave marks along the way.

497
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,390
Follow the marks and you'll find them.

498
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,990
OK.

499
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,710
[Wood Feather House]

500
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,190
[Luo Ye]

501
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,990
[Wood Feather House]

502
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,590
This is the mark.

503
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,190
Mark?

504
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,020
[Luo Ye]

505
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,150
What mark?

506
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,070
What are you doing here?

507
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,590
Someone gave me money

508
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,310
and asked me to stand here with this.

509
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,350
You can go now.

510
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,830
No.

511
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,030
I took a tael of silver,

512
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,380
but I'm standing here for less than 15 minutes.

513
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,430
How can I leave?

514
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,830
The person who made you stand here

515
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,270
just wants me to see it.

516
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,420
Now I see it. You're free to go now.

517
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,350
Really?

518
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,020
I still can't leave.

519
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,030
Why?

520
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,030
I took their money.

521
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,030
If I leave now, I would have a guilty conscience.

522
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,430
I should at least stand for an hour.

523
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,830
In this way, I can feel at ease with the money.

524
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,750
Right.

525
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,390
Then keep standing.

526
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,270
Your Highness,

527
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,500
during the work,

528
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,390
are you going to live in the House or...?

529
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,230
I'll live in the House.

530
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,590
Because you are all here.

531
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,470
That's great.

535
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,150
Why don't you make a sound?

536
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,550
Where's Luo Ye?

537
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,350
He's inside, worshipping the Buddha.

[Guangji Temple]

539
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,470
You go back first.

540
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,910
Are you sure you don't need me?

541
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,910
what can you do?

542
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,030
Are you looking down on me?

543
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,340
Fine.

544
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,350
There's nothing I can do.

545
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,790
I'll leave it to you.

[Guangji Temple]

547
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,430
But my advice is that

548
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,590
you should talk to him.

549
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,750
I‘m sure it will help.

550
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,470
Advice?

551
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,470
Sincere advice on life.

552
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,510
The two of them were in love

553
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,510
and were so sweet.

554
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,910
But at that very moment,

555
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,190
Han Niaoniao's father took her back,

556
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,510
which caused them to break up

557
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,510
and be separated.

558
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,510
It's so tragic.

559
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,510

I can't bear to see him so sad.

What do you want to say?

and I could set him up with.

567
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,150
I'm being kind.

571
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,150
Qingfeng, you got here at a good time.

572
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,870
I drew a straw.

573
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,990
But I don't dare to read it myself. You read it for me.

575
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,180
What's wrong?

576
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,150
It's not accurate.

577
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,550
I'll read it myself.

578
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,630
There're rivers and mountains ahead.

what's going to happen.

581
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,750
Let's get someone to explain what it means first.

582
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,030
No need.

583
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,990
I know the last two sentences.

No matter what you do, it's hard to get over it.

Bad things are going to happen.

586
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,830
It's the short straw.

590
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,190
Do you know why I'm so familiar with this straw?

591
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,750
Before our Wood Feather House got hit hard,

592
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,950
I went to the Lingyin Temple.

593
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,710
That's what I got.

594
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,430
I didn't let you know that time.

595
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,910
But you saw what happened later.

596
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,830
We almost died.

597
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,510
What you want this time is marriage. It's different.

598
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,430
Since ancient times, it's for comfort.

599
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,910
Don't let it bother you.

600
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,150
I understand.

601
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,510
Luo,

602
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,950
I think you should go find Niaoniao back.

603
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,230
Find her?

604
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,550
Why should I?

605
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,300
She is the daughter of the richest man in Yangzhou.

606
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,230
What am I?

607
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,110
I'm just a half-dead shopkeeper.

608
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,510
Even if I meet her father in Yangzhou,

609
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,470
what can I say?

610
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,950
Am I supposed to take her back?

611
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,150
You are not

613
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,950
You said you got a straw for Wood Feather

614
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,150
just like this one.

615
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,670
Even if it's the short straw,

616
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,510
think about Wood Feather now.

617
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,470
What's the big deal?

618
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,270
When one door shuts, another opens.

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,910
I understand what you said.

621
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,710
But I really have no choice now.

622
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,510
If the Wood Feather House has no money, I can go get some.

623
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,990
If there's a shortage of manpower, I can go find someone.

624
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,390
But marriage is different.

625
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,630
Others don’t understand.

Don't you understand?

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,790
I know.

00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,590
But I won't give up.

629
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,470
I'll do everything

Think about it.

Why did Niaoniao come to Lin'an?

638
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,230
Because she didn’t want to accept her father’s arrangement.

640
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,310
You told me last night

641
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,030
if it weren't for her father,

642
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,950
she would have said yes to your proposal.

What did you do?

665
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,830
You know, I want to marry Luo.

if you just tell her to stay?

don't want to lose Luo.

Stop saying such silly things.

709

Don’t mention it again.

Don’t argue with Luo

711
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,310
or she'll think you’re pushing her.

712
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,510
I’ll find a way

713
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,590
to talk to Luo about this.

714
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,150
OK, I see.

715
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,310
Alright, don't do this.

716
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,550
I, your master, am not the kind of person to mess with.

717
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,070
Even in the Northern Zhou,

718
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,870
I will never let anyone bully me.

719
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,500
Have you forgotten

720
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,750
how I grew up in the palace?

721
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,900
No one can bully me

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,110
anywhere.

723
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,790
The work is the most important thing now.

724
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,350
This afternoon,

725
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,550
I'm going to the scene of Fengjiang Tower to prospect.

726
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,710
I need you to run an errand to the Ministry of Works.

727
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,870
Find Mr. Situ

728
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,390
and tell him to get someone to take us there.

729
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,150
OK. I’ll go now.

730
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,070
Is anything else you want me to do?

731
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,310
Comfort Luo for me.

732
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,390
Just tell her you won’t push her on this.

733
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,990
This will help her relax

734
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,870
and she doesn't have to think about it later at work.

735
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,390
I see. I'll go now.

736
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,310
Come on.

00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,430
Sit down.

I'm really embarrassed to

740
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,550
have caused you so much trouble.

741
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,150
Cut the crap.

742
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,900
Sit.

743
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,550
Niaoniao is my good friend.

744
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
Tell me. What do you think?

745
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,950
I...

746
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,100
I‘m not sure.

747
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,270
Boss Luo.

748
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,150
Niaoniao must be waiting for you in Yangzhou

749
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,390
to bring her back.

750
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,230
You two seem to be separated,

751
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,870
but this is a test.

752
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,510
According to woman's intuition,

753
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,790
if you bring her back by yourself,

754
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,070
you will be happy together in the future.

755
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,470
On the contrary, you will regret it for the rest of your life.

756
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,230
Woman's intuition?

757
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,470
Woman's intuition is very efficacious.

758
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,620
You don't know, do you?

759
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,710
Don't hesitate. Be brave.

760
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,510
When you impress Niaoniao,

761
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,470
if Niaoniao's father is still stubborn,

762
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,910
you can come to me.

763
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,830
You?

764
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,670
Have you forgotten?

765
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,710
I'm the princess of Xiao.

766
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,950
You and Niaoniao are my best friends.

767
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,630
If you are in trouble,

768
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,390
how can I stand by and watch?

769
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,150
Come to me if you have any problems.

770
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,550
I'll go to His Majesty

771
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,870
and ask him to grant you a marriage.

772
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,230
I don’t believe

773
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,310
Niaoniao's father has the guts to disobey the edict.

774
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,990
You must be kidding.

775
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,190
I'm not joking.

776
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,100
But it still sounds like a joke.

777
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,830
I have no official position and no contribution.

778
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,430
How can I be granted by His Majesty?

779
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,630
You don't have it now

780
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,790
doesn't mean you won't have it.

781
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,030
You mean Fengjiang Tower?

782
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,350
When this thing gets done,

783
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,990
the Wood Feather craftsman team will surely make great contributions.

784
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,580
So, as long as you take the first step bravely,

785
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,710
there'll be a way to salvage.

786
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,830
If Niaoniao wants to,

787
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,270
I'll ask His Majesty to give an order,

788
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,750
then you will have nothing to worry about.

789
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,630
I'm very grateful for your kindness.

790
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,030
Then I'll go to Yangzhou right away.

791
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,590
No matter what,

792
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,860
I don’t want to have any regrets.

[Wood Feather House]

794
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,070
Boss Luo,

795
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,750
you must bring Niaoniao back.

796
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,990
Our Wood Feather House can't be without anyone.

797
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,950
OK, I will.

798
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,630
Luo Ye,

799
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,430
you are not my friend.

800
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,070
I talked to you for a long time, but you still hesitated.

801
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,270
Langyue said a few words and you made up your mind.

802
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,830
What did I say wrong?

803
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,390
Don't say that.

804
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,750
Your advice

805
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,470
is also very important.

806
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,630
You two are indispensable,

807
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,940
[Wood Feather House]

808
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,830
working very well together.

809
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,420
That's what you did at work,

810
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,270
and that's what you advise me to do now.

811
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,350
I really admire you both.

812
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,330
[Wood Feather House]

813
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,270
Where did you go?

814
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,420
[Wood Feather House]

815
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,310
What is this?

816
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,230
Take a look.

817
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,310
There're rivers and mountains ahead.

818
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,030
I know there'll be difficulties this time.

819
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,030
It’s all because of marriage.

820
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,270
Everything will be fine in the end.

821
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,390
The medium straw?

822
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,470
Last time you drew the straw in the Lingyin Temple.

823
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,430
Two years have passed.

824
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,830
This time was in the Guangji Temple.

825
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,430
Last time, you asked for business.

826
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,830
This time, you wanted marriage.

827
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,630
Of course it's different.

828
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,470
Look.

829
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,590
The short straw becomes the medium straw.

830
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,070
You didn't lie to me?

831
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,270
When did I lie to you?

832
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,350
Go to Yangzhou and get Niaoniao back.

833
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,990
After all, she is the supervisor of our Wood Feather.

834
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,630
We'll need her when we get started.

835
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,830
OK, I'll go now.

836
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,660
Quick.

837
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,750
You must bring Niaoniao back successfully.
