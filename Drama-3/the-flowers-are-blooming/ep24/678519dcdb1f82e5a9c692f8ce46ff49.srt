[Episode 24]

4
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,990
It's not embarrassing,

5
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,550
but we may die because of this!

6
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,670
I don't understand.

7
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,470
Think about it.

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,190
The Zhao family

9
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,979
is just a businessman.

10
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,750
How dare you invest in city defense and participate in state affairs!

11
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,830
What are you up to?

12
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,750
What will the court think of us?

13
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,310
But His Majesty wants to do this.

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,830
Ning,

15
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,789
His Majesty was only thinking about it.

16
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,630
Why should the Zhao family do it?

17
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,190
In my opinion,

18
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,180
it's not that you haven't thought of this.

19
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,910
I’m afraid it’s because of Li Qingfeng

20
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,430
that makes you so confused.

21
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,070
I told you a long time ago

22
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,829
that I was over Li Qingfeng.

23
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,870
Even if I saw him sad, I would be upset.

24
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,190
Even if I saw him pine away, I would feel bad.

25
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,790
But I've moved on.

26
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,110
In that case,

27
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,030
I think you shouldn't have anything to do

28
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,070
with that Li in the future.

29
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,110
I borrowed the money

30
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,540
not entirely because of him.

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,470
If not for him,

32
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,310
who else?

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,950
For other friends in the Wood Feather House.

34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,550
For myself.

35
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,270
And for the people of Xiao.

36
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,270
For Xiao,

37
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,300
for Xiao...

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,710
It's not your job

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,030
to worry about state affairs.

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,230
Of course I understand.

41
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,470
So I'd like you

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,510
to think of it as a Wood Feather House's business activity.

43
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,030
Take it

44
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,830
as a deal with the court.

45
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,990
Did you hear that?

46
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,110
A deal with the court.

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,910
Tell me,

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,620
who is qualified to make deals with the court in the world?

49
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,820
No one in the world is qualified,

50
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,990
but the world is qualified.

51
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,829
What do you mean?

52
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,620
What exactly do you want to do?

53
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,430
Take back the bride.

54
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,910
Take back the bride?

55
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,020
Yes.

56
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,630
Take Princess Zhaohe back to Xiao.

57
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,230
You want to take back a married princess.

58
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,350
Who give you the guts?

59
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,180
It's you.

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,230
You often tell me,

61
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,230
the reason why our Zhao family has the wealth we have today,

62
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,230
half relies on the struggle of ancestors,

63
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,980
and the other half is benefited from the country's prosperity.

64
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,230
We must bear in mind that

65
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,750
benefiting the world can bring in tremendous wealth.

66
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,030
If Princess Zhaohe really goes to the Northern Zhou,

67
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,350
the two states will sign an unequal treaty.

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,710
Xiao will be a subject

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,750
and live under the control of the Northern Zhou.

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,350
How can Zhao family be alone?

71
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,230
My naive daughter.

72
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,269
Even if Princess Zhaohe doesn't go to the Northern Zhou,

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,910
do you think they'll just let it go?

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,470
That's why we need to make super bows and change the city defense.

75
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,070
Enough!

76
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,310
I think,

77
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,790
you're not asking for 5 million taels of silver.

78
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,310
You're asking for the life of the entire Zhao family

79
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,310
and your father's head.

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,310
I dare not.

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,710
If you dare not,

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
then don't say it.

83
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,710
Let's stop here.

84
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,470
Dad!

85
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,390
Don't say it again.

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,870
It's no use talking.

87
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,270
If you like to kneel,

88
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,790
today

89
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,470
I'll make up my mind

90
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,270
and let you kneel!

91
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,580
Father.

92
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,780
Now is the time to use

93
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,150
your martial arts coaches.

94
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,470
Let them get changed

95
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,510
and wait outside the city.

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,940
My men are on standby.

97
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,910
Wang Sheng, please go to the palace again

98
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,780
and tell His Majesty

99
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,190
about the whole story.

100
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,420
The imperial edict

101
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,870
is our last chance.

102
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,350
OK. I’ll go to the palace now.

103
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,260
Wang Sheng and I are fine.

104
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't know if Miss Zhao is reliable.

105
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,110
If Miss Zhao fails to persuade Uncle Zhao,

106
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,030
I'll go back to Yangzhou to find my father.

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,550
Miss Zhao is our partner.

108
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:41,909
We should trust her.

109
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,630
OK. In that case,

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,870
Wang Sheng, it's up to you now.

111
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,870
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

112
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,070
Wang Sheng, you should know that

113
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,110
His Majesty can only rely on

114
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,110
us now.

115
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,430
Similarly,

116
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,710
we can only rely on

117
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,790
His Majesty.

118
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,550
That’s right.

119
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,990
No matter what,

120
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,350
His Majesty is on our side,

121
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,780
which gives us the greatest confidence.

122
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,420
I won't let you down.

123
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,350
The Zhao family is willing to give 5 million taels.

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,750
With these money,

125
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,870
I don't need the support of officials.

126
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,630
But I still can’t issue an imperial edict.

127
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,390
Your Majesty, you can't have any worries right now.

128
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,350
I'm not done yet.

129
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,230
I can't give the imperial edict.

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,310
But the secret edict, no one can interfere.

131
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,390
Your Majesty is wise.

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,420
There is one last question.

133
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,230
Can I

134
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,230
trust the Wood Feather House?

135
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,909
Your Majesty,

136
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,070
Wood Feather House is just a small craftsman team.

137
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,990
Our actions

138
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,190
won't be noticed by spies.

139
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,070
Even if there is,

140
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,950
Your Majesty, please trust me.

141
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,270
I'll escort them safely

142
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,790
to Kaifeng.

143
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,870
OK.

144
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,550
For the sake of Xiao

145
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,070
and Langyue,

146
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,110
I bet on this time.

147
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,070
Dad.

148
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,150
Get out.

149
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,460
Say you're wrong later.

150
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,790
Ning, don't you see me?

151
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,909
Yes.

152
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,510
Then why don't you say hi to me?

153
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,190
Hello, dad.

154
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,550
Get up.

155
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,950
I've already given you an out.

156
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,070
You don't take it?

157
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,550
I don't want it.

158
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,030
You!

159
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,110
Five million taels.

160
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,190
I have the money.

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,150
But have you thought about it?

162
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,990
How will you pay me back?

163
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,710
How do you protect the Zhao family?

164
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,870
From now on, I'll leave the Zhao family.

165
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,870
After this,

166
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,910
I'll devote myself to

167
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,590
the Zhao family's main business as an outsider.

168
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,350
I won't take a cent for a lifetime.

169
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,510
Ridiculous!

170
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,350
Think about it.

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,299
I give you 5 million taels of silver

172
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,789
and I'll lose my daughter.

173
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,190
Dad!

174
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,460
Fine, fine, fine.

175
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,590
Get up. Get up.

176
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,750
Get up.

177
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,550
Daughter,

178
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,990
I have something important for you to do.

179
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,910
Listen carefully.

180
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,510
Wanning Banking House got robbed

181
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,190
and lost 5 million taels of silver.

182
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm very anxious.

183
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,350
So,

184
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,870
don't do anything now.

185
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,220
The only thing you need to do

186
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,110
is to get the money back.

187
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,870
Thank you, dad.

188
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,430
Since you're spoiled,

189
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,860
then so be it.

190
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,710
Give the order.

191
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,030
We stay here tonight.

192
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,550
Yes.

193
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,990
Everyone rests at the station.

194
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,310
Everyone rests at the station.

195
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,550
Everyone rests at the station.

196
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,620
Princess, we arrive at the station.

197
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,710
Princess, I...

198
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,350

199
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,150
Qingfeng.

200
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,660
Are you alright? How are you?

201
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,950
Don't help me.

202
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,550
Slow down. Slow down.

203
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,550
Look at you.

204
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,540
Tell me.

205
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,230
Why did you

206
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,790
call me here?

207
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,910
If you feel better,

208
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,070
go pack your things.

209
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,950
Let's go to Kaifeng right away.

210
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,790
What?

211
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,950
Before we go to Kaifeng,

212
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,070
we have to get the princess back.

213
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,830
Your Majesty finally convinced all the civil and military officials.

214
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,270
It's Miss Zhao.

215
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,230
She borrowed 5 million taels of silver from her family.

216
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,310
Only then did Wang Sheng convince His Majesty

217
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,340
to send a secret edict to Kaifeng.

218
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,660
Now we have the money

219
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,430
and the imperial edict.

220
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,390
Everything is ready except the east wind. Let's head straight for Kaifeng.

221

[Secret Edict]

222
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,150
Miss Zhao.

223
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,350
Princess,

224
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,070
I made this dessert especially for you.

225
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,910
I just heated it up in the kitchen.

226
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,070
Would you like some?

227
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,470
Your Highness, what are you thinking about?

228
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,350
Nothing.

229
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,950
Sit.

230
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,470
I want to ask you a question.

231
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,590
Today,

232
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,140
you needn't feel embarrassed.

233
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,510
I want to ask

234
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,190
if you have disobeyed the order

235
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,350
when you married to the Northern Zhou,

236
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,990
would His Majesty really have beheaded us?

237
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,150
You little girl.

238
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,430
You still want me to disobey the order?

239
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,070
I didn’t mean that.

240
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,390
Luo, you’ve been with me a long time

241
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,350
and you still don't get it.

242
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,460
The royalty

243
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,150
has boundless wealth

244
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,350
and the highest status.

245
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,070
But

246
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,950
they also have greater responsibilities.

247
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,510
Now the country and the people are in crisis.

248
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,230
They need me.

249
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,390
How could I escape?

250
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,910
I admire what you have in mind.

251
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,710
But,

252
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,340
from your point of view,

253
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,670
I can't help being selfish.

254
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,670
Your Highness,

255
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,990
am I a terrible person

256
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,710
who makes you feel embarrassed?

257
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,510
How can you say that?

258
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,390
My silly Luo,

259
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,310
to be honest,

260
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,550
Before, I really didn't

261
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,750
have such a high consciousness.

262
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,670
Before,

263
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,430
to be precise,

264
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,830
it should be

265
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,500
before I joined the Wood Feather.

266
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,830
Before, I didn't have any understanding of

267
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,030
the words "People",

268
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,470
"Hunger",

"Poverty",

270
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,070
"War", and "Homeless".

271
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,630
After I joined the Wood Feather,

272
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,870
I met Tongtong,

273
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,470
and grandma,

Miss Zhang.

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,390
After that,

278
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,230
I truly understand

279
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,030
the real meaning of these words.

280
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,830
Luo, tell me.

281
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,150
If sacrificing my own happiness

282
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,030
can bring peace to Xiao

283
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,830
and save people from suffering,

284
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,350
how can I run away from it?

[Kaifeng]

568
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,510
Release!

569

[Kaifeng]

570
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,950
Release!

571
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,150
Attack!

572
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,470
Whoever retreat will be executed!

573
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,950
Release!

574
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,910
Prince,

575
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,990
we can't fight anymore.

576
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,790
We lost the battle.

577
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,990
If we keep fighting,

578
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,830
we won't even have a chance to retreat.

579
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,670
I'm afraid the whole army will be destroyed.

580
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,350
Shut up!

581
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,470
Impossible.

582
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,190
Prince, don't act on impulse.

583
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,630
Pass my order.

584
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,190
Retreat!

585
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,110
Yes.

586
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,550
Withdraw the troop!

587
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,990
In this battle, the super bow took the Northern Zhou army by surprise

588
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,710
and crushed its spirit.

589
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,670
Plus the Emperor Chen Qidao

590
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,990
was a good command and deployed at full strength.

591
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,190
All the officers and soldiers were united. The army was very powerful.

592

[Kaifeng]

593
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,590
They finally resisted the Northern Zhou army.

594
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,790
After that, the political direction turned back in the Southern Xiao.

595
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,870
They unified the state policy of ending the war.

596
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,310
Even if the Northern Zhou made repeated attacks,

597
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,110
the border was impregnable.

598
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,950
This battle also marked a watershed

599
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,430
in the military strength of the Southern Xiao and the Northern Zhou.

600
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,630
The Southern Xiao united as one and won one victory after another.

601
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,550
And the Northern Zhou was demoralized and losing ground.

602
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,670
In the end, they had to make peace.

I let them go,

610
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,270
but they won't let me go.

611

No matter what happens in the future,

I hope you

can always remember our Wood Feather House.

Our Wood Feather House

615

is a bright moon when we gather together.

We are stars in the sky when we scatter.

-Your Majesty. -Your Majesty.

621
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,420
Rise.

622
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

625
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,630
I'm glad you're back.

626
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,430
I'm glad you're back.

627
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,390
On the days you returned,

628
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,630
the Northern Zhou attacked Kaifeng three times,

629
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,660
but all failed.

630
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,230
Today's Kaifeng is impregnable.

631
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,910
And it has become an unbreakable line of defense

632
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,310
of Xiao.

633
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,390
The super bow enhanced our country's strength and invigorated our country's prestige.

634
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,270
You've contributed a lot.

635
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,790
The Northern Zhou dare not mention the marriage.

636
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,590
Now it's us who make

637
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,750
that so-called peace treaty.

638
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,270
Li Qingfeng,

639
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,270
you made a great contribution.

640
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,230
Tell me.

641
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,830
What do you want?

642
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,870
Your Majesty,

643
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,350
I do have a reward that I want.

644
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,590
Spit it out.

645
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,790
Your Majesty,

646
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,390
I want you to give me a marriage.

647
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,790
How dare you!

648
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,270
Li Qingfeng,

649
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,830
don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

650
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,020
You just made a crossbow for me.

651
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,270
Now you want to marry Princess Zhaohe.

652
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,390
Do you know what qualifications are required

653
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,790
to be the princess's husband?

654
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,950
Anyway,

655
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,100
Princess Zhaohe is my favorite sister.

656
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,550
Her marriage

657
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,390
is up to her to decide.

658
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,590
I won't make decisions without her permission.

659
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,870
Langyue, don't worry.

660
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,390
I know what Li Qingfeng wants,

661
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,270
and I won't give him a chance.

Don't make fun of me.

Fine.

675
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,270
do you want?

00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,870
I am a maid.

677
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,750
It’s my duty to serve the princess.

678
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,510
I dare not ask for a reward.

679
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,630
I dare not ask for anything.

680
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,470
I just hope the prosperity of Xiao

681
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,750
is gonna endure.

Women don't want anything,

686

but men ask for rewards one by one.

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,780

694
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,190
OK.

695

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,500

Yes.

700
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,630
The Zhao family gave money

701
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,989
to save the country,

702
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,310
which truly fulfilled the realm of serving the country and the people

703
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,030
and set a good example

704
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,830
for the businessmen in the world.

705
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,429
You did a great job.

706
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,949

707
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,430
I'll pay you back in full.

708

what else do you want?

710
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,870
Your Majesty,

711
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,390
if I can,

712
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,990
I also want a sweet marriage.

713
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,590
Otherwise, staying with them all day

714
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,990
will make me jealous.

715
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,150
I heard from Langyue that

716
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,710
there's a young man named Zhang Shaoqing

717

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,270
How about you two...

719
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,260
No need.

720
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,140
Well,

721
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,270
I'm just kidding.

722
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,870
Whether it's for the country and the people,

723
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,070
or for friends and partners,

724
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,590
the Zhao family won't refuse.

725
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,470
So I dare not ask for a reward.

726
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,590
Yes, brother.

727
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,510
Don't mix things up when you know nothing.

728
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,750
You scared Miss Zhao.

729
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,710
Looks like my information is wrong.

730
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,750
In this case,

731
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Zhao's reward

732
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,590
is up to me.

733
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

747

I’m here to congratulate you.

748
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,590
You are not sincere at all.

749

750

My business hasn't been very good recently.

752

753
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,710

754
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,860
