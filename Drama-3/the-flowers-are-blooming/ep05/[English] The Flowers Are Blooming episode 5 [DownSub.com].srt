[The Flowers Are Blooming]

00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,280
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,110
The sun hasn't set yet.

5
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,229
Instead of drinking and enjoying the beautiful view with the beauty,

6
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,310
you come back so early, huh?

7
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,310
Give me your measurement.

8
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,829
In the raising and folding technique, one unit of chi is counted as one zhang (chi and zhang are traditional Chinese units of length).

9
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,470
One cun is one chi (ibid).

10
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,710
One fen is one cun (ibid.

11
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,950
And one li is one fen (ibid).

12
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,020
We need to determine the angle of raising and folding

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,310
before we can measure the height of pillars.

14
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,630
But the data you measured

15
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,990
are very different from regular sizes.

16
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,750
You mean the proportion here

17
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,550
is 1:8 instead of 1:10?

18
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,590
This is because the walls are not flat,

19
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,829
and the distance shown in the drafting is not evenly distributed.

20
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,190
The proportion is therefore larger than usual.

21
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,630
Architect Li.

22
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,150
I did all the job

23
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,670
and you're so nit-picky here.

24
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,150
Do you think it's the right thing to do?

25
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,790
I was asking about the measurement, not judging you.

26
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,150
After dinner,

27
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,990
shall we draw the drafting together?

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,830
I won't.

[Wood Feather House]

30
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,190
I thought my drafting design of Tongtong's house

31

[Wood Feather House]

32
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,110
was good enough.

33
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,750
But now seeing yours,

34
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,030
I feel so humbled.

35
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,590
You are a genius.

36
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,950
In Lin'an,

37
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,460
there's never a shortage of people who admire me.

38
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,910
Li Qingfeng.

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,070
Can't you just be modest for a change?

40
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,670
Would you say something nice about my work too?

41
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,430
In terms of garden renovation,

42
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,070
I have nothing nice to say about you.

43
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,350
I'm really curious that,

44
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,150
with the way you talk to people,

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,990
how you managed to get along so well

46
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,150
with Miss Liu.

47
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,270
I was just discussing with her the renovation plan.

48
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,340
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,150
I saw you together.

50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,550
You and that girl were drinking and talking so happily

51
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,430
as if...

52
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,350
as if

53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,870
you were reunited with your dear friend after decades.

54
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,430
The work this time

55
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,630
was originally a garden renovation project.

56
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,510
Garden renovation

57
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,790
is all about managing hills, wind

58
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,590
There are three components of water management.

59
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,030
First, hills.

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,310
Huan Cai House

61
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,710
was built by Liu Tong.

62
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,270
Its hills and wind don't really necessitate management.

63
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,190
But the garden was built more than a century ago.

64
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,790
And the terrains and buildings around the garden

65
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,430
have changed a lot.

66
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,230
So now we need to draw the wind into the garden.

67
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,110
Second, wind.

68
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,390
The wind in the direction of the two new attics

69
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,630
should be drawn to the southeast.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,630
Third,

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,909
water.

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,630
The most difficult part is the expansion of the fish pond.

73
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,070
We need to renovate its water circulation system.

74
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,270
That's a lot of work.

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,780
A profitable job is indeed harder to do.

76
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,100
Don't worry.

77
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,790
As long as we follow the structure drafting,

78
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,830
we'll make it.

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,750
Mr. Luo.

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,990
You and Wang Sheng go to buy some quality buttonwood and pine wood

81
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
and coordinate with Mr. Meng.

82
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,870
You take care of the materials.

83
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,590
OK.

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,230
Chen.

85
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,110
Write down everything you need to report to the Ministry of Works

86
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,870
according to the drafting.

87
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,060
Then double check it with Miss Han.

88
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,790
Miss Han.

89
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,460
After you check it,

90
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,750
please teach Luo

91
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,950
the methods and documentation of measurements.

92
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,030
Luo.

93
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,030
Where is Luo?

94
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,909
Coming. Coming.

95
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,110
It's hot today.

96
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,750
Miss made pear soup for you to cool off.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,740
By the way, Architect Li,

98
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,990
this is yours.

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,700
Miss knows you've worked very hard

100
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,790
so she added astragalus and peony especially for you.

101
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,630
- Come on, everyone. - Thank you.

102
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,150
This is good.

103
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,620
Thank you.

104
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,190
So sweet.

105
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,630
What's wrong?

106
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,630
You don't like it?

107
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,510
Well.

108
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,190
I just don't like sweet food.

109
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,830
Don't you like sweet food the best?

110
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,350
Well, let me tell you about our upcoming work.

111
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,630
Chen.

112
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,780
You and I will be responsible

113
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,870
for the expansion of the pond.

114
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,750
What should I do?

115
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,030
I'm not gonna paint the walls again, am I?

116
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,590
As the general director, you don't need to paint the walls.

117
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,140
Please find ten

118
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,750
experienced stonemasons.

119
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,390
Stones...That doesn't really matter...

120
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,510
Every detail matters in architecture.

121
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,430
Don't take it lightly.

122
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,070
I knew

123
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,070
it's not easy to be the director.

124
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,630
All right.

125
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,630
If you're okay with the plan,

126
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,310
let's wrap up the meeting.

127
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,270
You can leave now.

128
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,070
You haven't finished the pear soup yet.

129
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,270
Right.

130
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,910
Master worked so hard for this.

131
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,270
You ungrateful bastard. I'll have it if you don't.

132
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,350
Yes, we can't waste it.

133
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,230
Right?

134
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,710
Why is it sour?

135
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,950
Is this plum soup?

136
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,910
No, it's very sweet.

137
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,750
According to the drafting,

138
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,110
the new pond should be here.

139
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:28,950
Sir.

140
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,270
I've brought the workers here.

141
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,550
How many are they?

142
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,310
30.

143
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,190
Good.

144
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,030
I was so exhausted by painting the walls last time.

145
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,950
I'm gonna take a break this time.

146
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,350
Send them here.

147
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,380
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,190
Come in.

149
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,510
Greetings, sir.

150
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,190
Li Qingfeng. Lucky you.

151
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,270
I paid myself for

152
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,909
these workers.

153
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,030
Let's go.

154
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,270
The garden is under construction now.

155
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,430
Why are you here all of a sudden?

156
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,950
I'd like to ask you something, Miss.

157
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,740
All right.

158
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,940
Go ahead.

159
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,910
I will tell you everything I know.

160
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,070
First,

161
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,590
why should the pond water be changed to nine chi deep?

162
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,540
Second,

163
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,470
why did you choose pine wood and buttonwood?

164
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,260
Sir.

165
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,310
These are two different things.

166
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,390
A few days ago, a friend of mine

167
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,590
gave me 13 red carps who usually live in deep water.

168
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,830
If the pond is too shallow,

169
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,429
those fish won't feel at home.

170
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,230
Red carps in deep water.

171
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,950
The carps are put in

172
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,030
the three small ponds in the garden.

173
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,820
I feel sorry for them.

174
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,550
When the renovation is done,

175
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,990
I'll put them into the deep-water pond.

176
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,990
Then why did you choose pine wood and buttonwood?

177
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,620
Pine trees are resilient.

178
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,030
And buttonwood is romantic.

179
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,550
Sir.

180
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,550
Do you think I'm resilient or romantic?

181
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,150
Miss.

182
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,070
Miss, is the water drawn out?

183
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,510
It should be soon.

184
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,030
It's out!

185
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,470
I worked so hard for this.

186
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,710
Miss, let me help you.

187
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,390
Why is the water gone?

188
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,230
What's wrong?

189
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,150
Let me see.

190
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,710
Is it OK?

191
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,540
It looks fine.

192
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,670
Is it blocked?

193
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,870
Why don't you go and ask Architect Li about this?

194
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,310
Right.

195
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,830
Where did he go?

196
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,470
He just disappeared all of a sudden.

197
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,390
He probably

198
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,190
went to see Miss Liu again.

199
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,750
Again?

200
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,070
Li Qingfeng...

201
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,430
You want to see me?

202
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,110
Architect Li.

203
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,550
You're finally back.

204
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,350
Do you still remember what you're supposed to do here?

205
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,550
Don't get mad during work.

206
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,710
Tell me what you want.

207
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,710
OK, Architect Li.

208
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,590
Your deputy architect, aka I, was trying

209
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,150
to put the water from this pond

210
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,790
into this new pond.

211
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,030
But I don't know why the water couldn't come out.

212
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,910
Please enlighten me.

213
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,860
There's only one reason.

214
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,030
The angle is wrong.

215
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,310
Give me the data you measured

216
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,910
and my drafting.

217
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,990
Come out with me.

218
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,030
Where are you taking me?

219
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,390
Sir.

220
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,910
How much are the buttonwood and pine wood?

221
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,310
We don't sell to individual customers.

222
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,710
You'd better check somewhere else.

223
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,030
Your boss has good connections, huh?

224
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,790
[Great Fortune]

225
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,550
This shop has only been open for less than half a year

226
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,150
and you already have regular customers?

227
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,150
Of course.

228
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,510
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,790
In fact, we are from the Ministry of Works.

230
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,150
The consort’s residence in the palace is being renovated.

231
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,350
That's why we're here

232
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,910
to check your materials for sale.

233
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,550
If you can provide us with good materials,

234
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,710
you’ll have a lot of business in the future.

235
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,350
Plenty of people come to my shop

236
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,310
and claim they work for the palace.

237
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,390
Do you have any proof?

238
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,670
You...

239
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,780
[Commander]

240
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,150
My apologies.

241
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,390
How much do you want?

242
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,030
Show us the wood first.

243
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,590
We won't buy anything if it's not up to our standards.

244
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,230
No problem.

245
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,150
Just a moment please.

246
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,260
I’ll take it for you.

247
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,460
We have the best wood you can find in Lin'an.

248
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,990
Where did you get this badge?

249
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,150
It's fake.

250
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,670
You...

251
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,030
A smart guy like that was fooled by your fake badge?

252
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,310
Yes.

253
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,350
- You... - There you go!

254
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:35,910
Sir,

255
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,180
check this out.

256
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,790
See?

257
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,950
This is the best wood.

258
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,510
The best you can find

259
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,830
in the entire Lin'an.

260
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,540
Not to mention it's for Noble Consort,

261
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,470
it's more than enough

262
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,910
to make a Phoenix chair for the Empress.

263
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,310
This is pretty good.

264
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,150
Not too bad.

265
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,990
Sir, Miss.

266
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,510
Here we are.

267
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,430
OK.

268
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,790
Where are we?

269
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,270
Do you want to sell me to the village?

270
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,830
I've never done this kind of business before.

271
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,820
Master Yu.

272
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,070
Master Yu?

273
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,790
Qingfeng!

274
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,150
You're here!

275
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,030
You

276
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,270
finally remember

277
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,710
to see your master, huh?

278
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,510
You've brought a pretty girl here.

279
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,670
Are you two married?

280
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,790
Her name is Chen Langyue.

281
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,310
She's the deputy architect of Wood Feather House.

282
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,350
What a lovely girl.

283
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,550
She must be from a rich family.

284
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,190
I'm sure that

285
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,510
you piss her off a lot, huh?

286
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,110
The tea is for you.

287
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,830
Very good.

288
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,380
Tell me. What are you here for?

289
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,430
I have a question for you.

290
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,950
You brat.

291
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,830
Can't you just lie to me for once?

292
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,670
Why can't you just say you miss me and want to visit me?

293
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,470
You're a big boy

294
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,350
and still can't tell a white lie.

295
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,870
The drafting, please.

296
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,860
Check this out.

297
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,470
[pave the surface and collect rainwater]

298
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,470
[graded gravel layer]

299
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,350
Let me see.

300
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,710
There's something wrong with the angle here.

301
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,160
[graded gravel layer]

302
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,270
Here?

303
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,590
How about this?

304
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,670
You should put around this pond

305
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,340
[pave the surface and collect rainwater]

306
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,340
[graded gravel layer]

307
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,950
permeable paving surfaces

308
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,830
to collect rain.

309
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,150
Next,

310
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,110
change this angle.

311
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,550
Make it bigger

312
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,310
for a drain pipe.

313
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,150
On the surface and under the pipe,

314
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,910
put another graded gravel layer.

315
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,870
This is

316
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,430
what I thought I should do.

317
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,550
But in doing so,

318
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,870
only 70% of the water in the old pond will be drawn out.

319
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,190
This angle is still wrong.

320
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,070
How about this?

321
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,470
Remove the graded gravel layer.

322
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,510
In this way, the water pressure of two ponds

323
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,510
will remain different.

324
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,630
Girl,

325
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,950
you're not only pretty, but also smart.

326
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,390
No wonder she can be your assistant.

327
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:45,900
Girl,

328
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,830
let me ask you.

329
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,070
Do you

330
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,350
sometimes want to

331
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,110
beat him up when he's asleep?

332
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,790
To be honest,

333
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,550
I want to do it every second.

334
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,790
I'm right.

335
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,940
I'll tell you what.

336
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,390
This brat

337
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,150
has been stubborn and arrogant since he was little.

338
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,510
And he hasn't changed at all.

339
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,830
Once,

340
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,430
his father made him a wooden horse,

341
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,710
which was broken by his aunt.

342
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,790
He was so angry

343
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,110
that he didn't eat or drink anything for three days and nights.

344
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,220
Nobody could reason with him.

345
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,310
It was his mother who disciplined him in the end.

346
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,870
But she died so soon.

347
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,830
and suffered a lot while she was alive.

348
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,990
He blamed his father for this

349
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,750
and still doesn't want to go back home.

350
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,750
Master Yu.

351
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,550
Oh yes.

352
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,710
Let's get down to business.

353
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,080
[pave the surface and collect rainwater]

354
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,080
[graded gravel layer]

355
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,910
About the issue,

356
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,710
she's right.

357
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,110
The graded gravel layer

358
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,030
shouldn't be fixed.

359
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,790
Make sure its angle is flexible and can change at any time.

360
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,510
Then after the water from the old pond comes in,

361
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,830
it won't flow out.

362
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,030
In the future,

363
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,990
just use rain to circulate the water.

364
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,710
I see.

365
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,230
Thank you, Master Yu.

366
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,510
You brat.

367
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,550
Cut the crap.

368
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,310
When you are free,

369
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,670
come and visit me more often.

370
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,589
That's what I really care.

371
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,230
By the way,

372
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,310
come back with her.

373
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,030
What are you thinking?

374
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,780
Work.

375
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,230
You're really dedicated to work, aren't you?

376
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,070
The renovation means a lot to Miss Liu.

377
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,230
As the architect,

378
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,670
I must do my best.

379
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,550
I don't know if you're doing your best for work

380
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,550

381

382
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,470
You're such a good girl.

383
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,430
You're beautiful, kind-hearted

384

385
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,630
The man who will marry you

386
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,190
must be a really lucky guy.

387
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,430
You're good too, sir.

388
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,350
What's so good about me?

389
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,190
Tell me.

390
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,190
The weather has been damp these days.

391
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,430
Miss has been so busy with the project.

392
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,340
I heard her coughing several times at night.

393
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,230
I was going to make some osmanthus lotus seed soup for her.

394
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,950
But you did it.

395
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,470
It saved me a lot of time.

396
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,790
That's right.

397
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,990
I saw her

398
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,350
preoccupied with work and not eat well.

399
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,340
I want to cook something healthy for her.

400
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,270
Luo.

401
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,590
You know very well how much I'm into her.

402
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,790
Don't forget to put in good words for me.

403
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,350
I will.

404
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,030
I know you're serious about Miss.

405
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,670
I'll definitely help you.

406
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,590
Do you think

407
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,230
Miss and I will be a good couple?

408
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,150
Sir, look.

409
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,590
Although the osmanthus soup is cooked in low heat,

410
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,590
it will be ready in two hours.

411
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,790
So,

412
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,310

413
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,270

Let's go.

Come on! Go!

428
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,430
What happened?

429
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,830
Was someone sent away? Was he hurt?

430
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,790
Meng Yuanxu, where did you find the stonemansons?

431
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,910
To pile the rocks here

432
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,830
is about angle and safety.

433
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,070
They just put one rock above another.

434
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,790
That's why the accident happened!

435
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't think it's that serious.

436
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,820
Then tell me

437
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,590
where you were.

438
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,910

Answer me.

I was making osmanthus soup for you.

Tell me.

443
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,310
Did you find those stonemasons yourself?

444
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,460
I'm the director.

445
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,670
Do I have to

446

find stonemasons myself?

447
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,190
Then

448
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,430
I asked you to find ten stonemasons.

449
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,350
How many did you find?

450
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,350
30.

451
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,950
What's wrong?

What about the extra cost?

453
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,900
There's no extra cost.

454
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,230
I hired them myself.

Who do you think you are, Li Qingfeng?

456
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,070
Are you interrogating me?

I'm not.

458
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,270
I told you

459
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,750
the Wood Feather House doesn't welcome slackers.

460
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,230
You failed to do your job.

You're fired.

I'm not.

469

You think I was wrong?

471
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,020
He didn't mean it.

472
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,070
It's just that he did something bad with good intention.

473
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,990
If he makes the same mistake again, then...

474
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,350
That's not the problem.

475
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,910
The problem is his thinking.

476
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,350
He doesn't really care about work and architecture.

477
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,070
He only cares about you.

478
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,150
He made mistakes when rebuilding Tongtong's house.

479
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,350
But I didn't blame him because it happened for the first time.

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,870
Is this your priority now?

566
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,070
Aren't you afraid that I will punish you for daring to make a move on me?

567
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,630
That's all I have to say.

568
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,190
You should know what to do.

569
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:55,870
You can go now.

570
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,710
Master...

571
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,390
Miss.

572
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,470
Where's Mr. Meng?

573
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,260
He's fine. Don't worry.

574
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,310
It's there.

575
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,630
The wind can blow from there.

576
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,590
The sun shines from there too.

577
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,630

579
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,830
In this case...

580
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,310
Miss Liu.

581
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,830
We're going to

582
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,270
deal with the mountain.

583
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,470
I need to talk to you.

584
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,430
You don't need to beg for mercy for him.

585
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,030
When can you

586
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,750
stop being so self-important?

587
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,430
Why are you so sure I'm pleading for Meng Yuanxu?

588
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,750
Aren't you?

589
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,190
You only care about Miss Liu, don't you?

590
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,180
What are you doing?

591
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,870
It's very sweet!

592
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,870
- I don't like this. Let's go.  - Try it.

593
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,230
Let's check over there.

594
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,630
Sir, how about two grapefruit?

595
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,470
Boss.

596
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,430
Give me an unripe grapefruit.

597
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,270
OK.

598
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,190
There you go.

599
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:17,830
Thank you.

600
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,670
What are you doing?

601
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,710
Try it.

602
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,750
It's so sour.

603
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,660
You know it's sour, huh?

604
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,070
What do you mean?

605
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,150
Miss Liu and I were just talking about renovation.

606
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,070
Don't misunderstand us.

607
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,870
Alright?

608
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,990
It's none of your business.

609
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,390
Of course it's my business.

610
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,510
I hate to see you misunderstand me.

611
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,150
It's my own business.

612
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,060
Stop bossing me around!

613
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,990
Do you still want the grapefruit?

614
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,790
No.

615
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,630
I don't want to drink your sour soup either.

616
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,820
Everyone had the same soup.

617
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,190
Hey!

618
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,630
What are you doing here?

619
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,300
Why don’t you go to your dream man?

620
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,590
By the way,

621
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,350
I heard from your sister-in-law that

622
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,270
Li Qingfeng

623
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,950
went to see Miss Liu.

624
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,910
They had a great time together.

625
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,430
Sister-in-law...

626
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,500
I only saw that boy

627
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,390
once or twice.

628
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,510
But I'm sure

629
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,870
he doesn't like girls like Miss Liu.

630
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,710
Why?

631
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,630
Why?

632
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,550
He doesn't even like you!

633
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,030
Are you really my brother?

634
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,870
By the way, sis.

635
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,990
You should tell me about

636
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,070
his deputy architect.

637
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,110
I heard from your sister-in-law that

638
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,470
she's really something.

639
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,110
Chen Langyue?

640
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,790
Exactly.

641
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,220
I think

642
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,430
she must be from a good family.

643
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,030
Even Officer Meng is trying to woo her.

644
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,870
Is she pretty?

645
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,310
Brother, are you trying to...

646
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,870
What are you talking about?

647
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,870
Your sister-in-law will kill me!

648
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,350
Then why do you care about her?

649
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm just worrying about you.

650
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,670
Listen.

651
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,710
Miss Liu is not a threat.

652
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,350
Chen Langyue is.

653
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,550
To be honest,

654
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,430
I think so too.

655
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,590
Since the first time I saw Miss Chen,

656
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,030
I could feel

657
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,670
something strange

658
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,630
between her and Li Qingfeng.

659
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,790
But they are both architects

660
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,070
and colleagues.

661
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,550
What can I do about it?

662
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,670
My silly sister.

663
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,510
When it comes to doing business,

664
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,350
you know how to make it work.

665
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,310
But why don't you

666
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,670
have a clue when it comes to relationship?

667
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,750
By the way,

668
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,070
didn't you just say

669
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,670
Mr. Meng likes Miss Chen?

670
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,390
Then why don't you

671
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,550
bring Miss Chen and Meng

672
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,750
together?

673
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,220
Then Li Qingfeng

674
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,910
will be yours for sure.

675
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,670
Right?

676
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,630
In this case,

677
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,190
Li Qingfeng was out of order.

678
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,670
Meng, just tell us what to do.

679
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,620
We'll follow your order.

680
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,070
That's right.

681
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,430
Say it.

682
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,070
Yes.

683
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,580
That's not what I'm talking about.

684
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,950
He's just an architect.

685
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,470
If I want to punish him, it'll be very easy to do.

686
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,830
But now, I still want to stay in Wood Feather House.

687
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,230
So the key is to get his permission for me to stay.

688
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,820
Understand?

689
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,070
By the way,

690
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,550
I'm not gonna apologize to him, all right?

691
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,790
Think of other solutions.

692
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,110
Why are you so upset?

693
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,830
What's exactly about that team of architects?

694
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,510
I have no choice.

695
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,030
You don't have to worry about that.

696
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,390
According to Meng,

697
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,710
Li Qingfeng is stubborn and headstrong.

698
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,820
And we can't

699
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,910
deal with him the way we usually do.

700
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,220
That's difficult.

701
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,950
Of course it's difficult.

702
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,630
I wouldn't have asked your help if it's an easy thing to do!

703
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,390
I have an idea.

704
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,670

00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,670
Pull the rug from under him.

709
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,910

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,230
and then was dismissed because of violation of the rules.

754
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,310
I didn't find out what you did exactly,

755
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,110
but now that you're in Wood Feather House as a chief executive,

756
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,510
you must be short of money, right?

757
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,470
50 taels of silver.

758
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,950
Deal, bro.

759
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,790
Come out a little bit more.

760
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,430
I think

761
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,350
it's almost done.

762
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,150
Give that to me. Be careful.

763
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,750
Here.

764
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,950
Move inside.

765
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,230
OK.

766
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,470
Sir?

767
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,670
You...

768
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,950
You're dressed like this...

769
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,390
I want you to

770
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,710
put in good words for me.

771
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,990
You still want to stay?

772
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,550
Your Miss, aka my master.

773
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,710
You know how much I like her.

774
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,870
She sneaked out of the palace.

775
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,270
Although you take good care of her,

776
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,070
it's not safe for her here.

777
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,190
After all, no place is safer than the palace.

778
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,390
Without a man protecting her,

779
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,710
she can be put in danger any time!

780
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,710
I can ask Architect Li to let you stay.

781
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,910
But even if I do,

782
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,870
he might not follow my advice.

783
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,070
That'll suffice.

784
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,790
In fact,

785
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,590
I’ve told others to help me too.

786
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,270
Befriend the distant ones and attack the ones nearby.

787
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,670
Pull the rug from under him. Do you understand?

788
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,380
The collection point of rain should be three chi away from the pond.

789
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,470
Don't put it high or lower.

790
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,150
Architect Li,

791
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,990
it's 3 chi.

792
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,100
Let's get started.

793
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,150
Master Yu is awesome!

794
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,310
He's the most experienced engineer

795
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,750
of water project.

796
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,350
I admire him a lot.

797
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,550
After the hills are separated, the wind is warm and pleasant here.

798
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,270
That's right.

799
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,150
As long as Architect Li

800
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,469
decides to do something,

801
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,469
he'll do a great job.

802
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:21,949
Qingfeng.

803
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,070
I was sitting in the street for a whole morning.

804
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,469
Nobody came to apply for the position as a director.

805
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,550
Mr. Luo, then keep it up

806
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,350
and stay there for another ten days or half a month.

807
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,750
- Or even one month or two months... - Tell me when it's done.

808
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,110
Just stay there for three, four, five, six, seven, eight months

809
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,020
until Architect Li is happy!

810
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,670
Let's go.

811
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,650
[Fun by Buttonwood]

812
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,790
Wrong.

813
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:45,790
Wrong.

814
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,469
Mr. Li, what’s wrong?

815
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:47,870
Mr. Li.

816
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,270
What's wrong?

817
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,190
How?

818
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
No need to set the lintel.

819
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,909
Take it down.

820
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,630
Why?

821
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,190
Look.

822
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,510
It's on the drafting.

823
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,510
Normally, there is little wind blowing in a garden like this.

824
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,510
Even if the wind does blow,

825
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,350
the buildings will affect its direction

826
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,950
temperature and duration

827
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,830
making it no more pleasant.

828
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,590
So we've split hills and draw the wind

829
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,620
into the garden

830
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,750
to pass the first attic.

831
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,630
Hollowed-out lintels can solve the problem.

832
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,230
But when the wind blows here,

833
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,630
if we still want it to be nice and comfortable,

834
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,070
the lintel here will be a hinderance.

835
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,030
So,

836
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,950
we must remove it.

837
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,070
I see.

838
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,310
Qingfeng,

839
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,310
you never explained

840
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,630
your changes on construction site.

841
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,430
What's wrong today?

842
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,830
You explained everything so clearly.

843
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,750
You asked me the question.

844
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,670
I explained in details and you have a problem with that?

845
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,910
Mr. Li, Mr. Luo.

846
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,980
The lintel is removed.

847
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,420
OK.

848
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,030
Just take it

849
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,870
and put it up to the other attic.

850
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,230
Be careful. Wait.

851
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,230
What's wrong?

852
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,430
This is pine wood.

853
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,430
That is buttonwood.

854
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,780
How can you mix the two?

855
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,750
Oh, I forgot.

856
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,550
Fine.

857
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,230
Take it off.

858
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,790
Take it and go with me.

859
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,140
Miss Liu is weird.

860
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,430
It’s one garden here.

861
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,780
Why does she have to use

862
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,830
two kinds of wood?

863
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,270
I don't get it either.

864
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,390
Be careful. Watch out.

865
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,190
But I think

866
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,070
maybe it's just an obsession of hers.

867
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,030
So even though you've talked to her,

868
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,070
you still don't understand everything about her plan.

869
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,820
But pine wood and buttonwood

870
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,270
are always popular with elegant people.

871
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,910
Is it really a coincidence?

872
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,230
Do you think this garden looks like a...

873
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,350
Architect Li.

874
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,830
I have something to tell you.

875
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,390
Go ahead.

876
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,910
I hope you can give Mr. Meng another chance.

877
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,910
I don't know what is the misunderstanding between you.

878
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,150
But I think

879
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,630
he's a qualified director.

880
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,430
He's a bit rebellious,

881
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,230
and make mistakes from time to time.

882
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,030
But nobody's perfect.

883
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,590
As long as he's willing to change for the better,

884
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,190
why don't you give him another chance?

885
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,110
I see.

886
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,230
Go back to your work.

887
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,430
Architect Li, you know what happened to me.

888
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,110
I'm new to your team.

889
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,550
I see the way you work together.

890
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,350
Although you're all different,

891
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,110
you get along well with each other.

892
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,710
With you guys,

893
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,910
I feel the warmth of a big family.

894
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,190
I know you are always cautious

895
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,830
and have a high standard when it comes to architecture.

896
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,630
On the other hand, Mr. Meng is more unrestrained.

897
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,060
So the conflicts are inevitable.

898
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,430
But I think it's just something unavoidable

899
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,550
for a team.

900
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,830
That's why

901
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,230
you should give him a second chance, right?

902
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,430
He's not unrestrained.

903
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,270
He's simply irresponsible.

904
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,110
Niaoniao, I want to thank you on behalf of Meng Yuanxu.

905
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:52,750
Architect Li.

906
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,350
Luo.

907
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,750
The fake hills have been rebuilt as planned

908
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,790
with one third of extra rocks left.

909
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,830
Is that normal?

910
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,550
Yes.

911
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,350
You just need to make a record of the work.

912
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,430
This is what I wrote down today.

913
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,390
Look, Architect Li.

914
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,390
Have some water.

915
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,350
OK.

916
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,110
Thank you.

917
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,420
Alright.

918
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,150
Architect Li.

919
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,830
Well...

920
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,390
What's wrong?

921
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,710
Nothing.

922
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,310
It's about Mr. Meng.

923
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,550
He knows it's his fault

924
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,230
and is reflecting on himself.

925
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,950
I know I'm just a maid.

926
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,910
But it was the first time he made the mistake.

927
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,270
Would you please give him another chance?

928
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,750
If he does it again,

929
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,470
I'm sure he will

930
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,350
bear the consequences.

931
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,790
You know Meng Yuanxu better than me.

932
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,470
Let me ask you.

933
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,190
Do you think he's suitable to work with us?

934
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,910
OK.

935
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,270
I see.

936
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,270
Are you here to intercede on his behalf too?

937
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,270
Why not give him another chance?

938
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,350
I've made up my mind.

939
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,190
Don't mention it again.

940
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,990
Li Qingfeng, I heard it.

941
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,910
Just say it.

942
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,630
It's about Mr. Meng.

943
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,590
Is it true that he has a crush on Miss Chen?

944
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,510
He's really got a lot of helpers here.

945
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,310
I'm not here for him.

946
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,030
I don't think

947
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,390
it's a big deal.

948
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,910
I mean, Mr. Meng and she are a perfect couple.

949
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:43,940
You see.

950
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,790
They've known each other since childhood

951
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,790
and grew up together.

952
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,870
Mr. Meng is deeply in love with Miss Chen.

953
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,310
And Miss Chen also cares about him a lot.

954
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,620
They appear to be master and disciple.

955
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,510
But in fact, they are in love.

956
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,790
So I think

957
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,510
you'd better not get in their way.

958
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,030
Because of his mistake,

959
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,270
the worker was injured and the construction is delayed.

960
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,990
Now you think it’s all my fault?

961
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,350
Calm down.

962
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,710
He didn't do it on purpose.

963
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,590
You just said you were not here for him.

964
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,510
He delayed the project

965
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,670
and now we have to make up for the lost time.

966
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,110
Miss Zhao,

967
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,790
I'm going to work.

968
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,150
Hey. I'm back just at the right time.

969
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,630
I bought the pork from Zhang's

970
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,510
and the signature wine from Drunken Immortal Restaurant.

971
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,870
Luo, get two plates here.

972
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,510
The pork weighs 4 kilos.

973
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,630
We need two plates for it.

974
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,990
No need.

975
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,350
I know.

976
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,670
Architect Li, don't dismiss my kind gestures.

977
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,590
Let's forget our grudges.

978
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,350
I promise

979
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,950
I will never do it again.

980
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,430
Is that OK?

981
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,590
Qingfeng.

982
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,790
Look.

983
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,950
Mr. Meng is sincere.

984
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,270
And he has learned his lesson.

985
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,190
He won't make the same mistake again.

986
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,260
Besides,

987
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,870
it's not easy to recruit people now.

988
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,630
Where can we find a new director?

989
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,550
Thanks to Miss Zhao's generosity and support, our Wood Feather House

990
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,310
brings together these like-minded people.

991
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,070
We can't break up so easily.

992
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,150
That's right.

993
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,270
Come on.

994
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,750
Come on!

995
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,670
We're dear friends at Wood Feather House.

996
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,550
And we should share happiness as well as hardship together.

997
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,750
In the future,

998
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,150
there’s still a long way to go for us.

999
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,470
Yes, Mr. Luo is right.

1000
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,670
It’s destiny that brings us together.

1001
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,990
How can we break up so easily?

1002
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,230
That's right.

1003
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,630
Come on.

1004
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,510
Come on.

1005
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,430
Qingfeng!

1006
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,660
Li Qingfeng, stop!

1007
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:46,910
Mr. Meng!

1008
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,710
Why do you hate me so much?

1009
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,350
Mr. Meng!

1010
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,110
Miss Chen.

1011
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,470
Sir.

1012
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,310
Go talk to him.

1013
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,870
I don't hate you.

1014
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,340
But I won't change my mind,

1015
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,710
no matter how many of them are helping you.

1016
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,590
Li Qingfeng, you are tough, huh?

1017
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,990
I've showed enough respect to you.

1018
00:41:59,470 --> 00:41:59,990
Mr. Meng!

1019
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,550
Calm down!

1020
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,350
Easy!

1021
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,190
Who do you think you are?

1022
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,590
Nobody in the entire Lin'an

1023
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,310
dares to talk to me like that!

1024
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,350
Everyone in Lin'an praises you as the best official.

1025
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,790
But to me,

1026
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,790
you're the most insolent official from a rich family.

1027
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,670
What did you say?

1028
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,470
Am I wrong?

1029
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,910
Have you really done anything serious?

1030
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,270
Everybody in Lin'an is afraid of you.

1031
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,430
Does anyone really respect you?

1032
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,510
You can do whatever you want.

1033
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,230
But don't hurt the reputation of Wood Feather.

1034
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,260
We can't afford the consequences.

1035
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,830
