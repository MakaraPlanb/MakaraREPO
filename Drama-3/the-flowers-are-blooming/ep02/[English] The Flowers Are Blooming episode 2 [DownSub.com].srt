What are you doing?

It's you again?

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,310
Aren't you supposed to be in Zhao's Mansion?

7
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,230
This is my house.

8
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,510
Why should I be in Zhao's Mansion?

9
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,590
Did you lose money in gamble

10
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,860
and sneak in to steal, right?

11
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,060
I don't think Miss Zhao

12
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,750
will find you attractive.

13
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,829
Wait.

14
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,780
Did you say this is your house?

15
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,190
Are you...

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,230
How is that possible?

17
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,750
So,

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,310
you know Li Qingfeng?

19
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,270
Forget it.

20
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,829
Come with me.

21
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,150
My Lady.

22
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,510
I didn't mean it.

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,590
I know how hard it is to make a wooden kite.

24
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,350
That's why I have to make up for it.

25
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,510
Are you Li Qingfeng’s apprentice?

26
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,750
Can you help me fix it?

27
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,510
Do you think it can be fixed?

28
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,990
I checked.

29
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,630
It looks fine from the outside.

30
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,430
But we need to open its body,

31
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,870
and figure out the tenon and mortise structure inside.

32
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,750
Get out.

33
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,710
You can ask for anything you need.

34
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,790
How much will it cost?

35
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,550
I'll pay it.

36
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,070

Why are you so mean?

39
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,430
When I see Senior Li Qingfeng later,

40
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,110
I'll apologize to him.

41
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,510
He won't be as rude and unreasonable as you.

Why is he so mean to me?

45
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,870
It’s my fault. I shouldn't have been so curious.

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,350
Please punish me.

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,630
Luo, it’s not your fault.

48
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,510
Don't blame yourself.

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,390
They must be short of money.

51
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,670
Whatever Mr. Li asks,

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,990
I'll pay for it.

53
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,630
I'm sure Mr. Li can fix it.

54
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,390
Fix it.

55
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,230
Inside the wooden kite, besides the tenon and mortise structure,

56
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,910
there are 17 bronze cogs

57
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,750
of different sizes.

Each cog has been specially remoulded.

It's not as simple as you think.

60

Of course you can't fix it.

There were still problems that I couldn't fix.

you are not qualified to be an architect here.

Wood Feather House has such a bad reputation

Didn't you say we'll have new people if we have money?

174

Let's see what they're talking about.

182
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,390
I'd rather not.

183

You might as well employ her first.

184

We'll replace her after we find a better one.

185

Did you hear that?

380
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,150
She said it.

381
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,950
You really brought people here.

382
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,950
You look like a martial artist.

383
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,510
Which position do you want to take?

384
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,270
The chief executive.

385
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,910
Being the chief executive

386
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,950
indeed requires excellent martial arts.

387
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,230
You indeed look like a master.

388
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,910
But I still want to give you a test.

389
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,630
Then I can decide how much I will pay you.

390
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,750
I don't care about my salary.

391
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,030
But I care about your skills.

392
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,020
Why didn't you fight back?

393
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm afraid I might hurt you.

394
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,710
Alright. Alright.

395
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,910
Bro, you're good.

396
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,620
I'll give you 10 taels per month.

397
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,150
What's your name?

398
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,230
Wang Sheng.

399
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,510
Take care.

400
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,510
Here.

401
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,820
Waiter, we'll have some tea.

402
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,030
Got it. Sit here please.

403
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,190
Slow down.

404
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,790
We had no evidence.

405
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,270
So we had to let him go for now.

406
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,630
Miss, don't worry.

[Righteousness]

408
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,750
I will punish him severely someday.

409
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,550
We can't let him do evil again.

410
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,590
That butcher has done many evil things.

411
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,950
He has bullied

412
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,470
this kid repeatedly.

413
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,270
Please enjoy.

414
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,750
If you can stop him from doing harming,

415
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,590
it'll benefit the people here.

416
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,070
Of course I will.

417
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,110
Miss,

418
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,470
did you want to tell me something?

419
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,070
Did you post it?

420
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,950
[Recruitment]

421
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,750
Are you going to ask for a job?

422
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,350
No.

423
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,310
I want to ask you

424
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,670
whether you can do a small job for me.

425
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,150
Since we are a craftsman team,

426
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,190
of course we will do the job.

427
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,750
Wait.

428
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,190
What’s going on with you?

429
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,470
Are you working for Wood Feather?

430
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,230
Yes.

431
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,830
I'm the deputy architect now.

432
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,030
Luo is the secretary.

433
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,310
Thank you.

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,590

Come here.

436
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,510
What secret task did the palace give you?

437
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,830
You think I'll let you know the secret task?

438
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,910
That's right.

439
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,270
But you're the noble prin...

440
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,070
Don't call me Princess.

441
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,430
Then what should I call you?

442
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,830
Master.

443
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,190
Master?

444
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,270
What are you looking at?

445
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,470
I think he can protect me.

446
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,510
All of us will protect you.

447
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,790
Do you remember that

448
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,070
when we were young, in the Ministry of Works,

449
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,350
I taught you how to carve swords with wood?

450
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,590
How could I forget?

451
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,910
Those were my happiest days.

452
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,230
Exactly.

453
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,150
So it's fair to say I'm your master.

454
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,590
You should call me master.

455
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,430
OK.

456
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,750
Master.

457
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,070
My good apprentice.

458
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,430
But you have to

459
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,590
keep it a secret.

460
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,070
All right.

461
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,670
Master,

462
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,030
how about

463
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,150
taking me to Wood Feather too?

464
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,510
As you know, I like you.

465
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,510
Stop, stop, stop.

466
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,150
That's what happened when we were little. Stop it.

467
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,310
Alright.

468
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,990
But you know it.

469
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,230
I don't have anything serious to do

470
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,510
and wander around all day long.

471
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,230
If I can work with you,

472
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,830
it must be much more interesting.

473
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,740
Mr. Luo.

474
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,270
You're back, Miss Chen.

475
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,550
Have a seat.

476
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,350
We are about to eat.

477
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,950
You look familiar.

478
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,350
His name is Meng Yuanxu.

479
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,190
He's looking for a job.

[Righteousness]

481
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,990
Who is this gentleman?

482
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,990
Wang Sheng.

483
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,150
The new chief executive of Wood Feather craftsman team.

484
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,670
Chief executive?

485
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,350
Why haven't I heard of this position?

486
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,590
Miss Chen, you don't know it.

487
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,990
Normally, craftsman teams in the Ministry of works

488
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,470
don't need a chief executive.

489
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,070
But private craftsman teams

490
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,780
usually have all kinds of complicated matters.

491
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,590
We need a chief executive like Wang Sheng

492
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,590
who can use force

493
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,310
to solve problems.

494
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,670
I see.

495
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,350
Wait.

496
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,230
He's the chief executive.

497
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,350
Then what do I, an official, do here?

498
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,030
So you're an official.

499
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,990
No wonder you look familiar.

500
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,990
Nice to meet you. Wait.

501
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,150
We've never met before. Don't cotton up to me.

502
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,230
You're right.

503
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,270
Please have a seat.

504
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,350
Since you're an official,

505
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,710
why do you look for a job in Wood Feather House?

506
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,910
I do it for a reason.

507
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,430
Just tell me if you want me or not.

508
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,350
A talent like you

509
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,670
is exactly what we are looking for.

510
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,670
You're the best employee we can have.

511
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,150
It's just that

512
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,430
we can only pay you very little salary.

513
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,310
I'm afraid you won't be happy with that.

514
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,670
You think I want your money?

515
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,150
Of course not.

516
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,910
Of course not.

517
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,070
But,

518
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,350
I don't get it.

519
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,710
Why do you want to work here?

520
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,470
I just...

521
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,830
He wants to be a carpenter.

522
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,550
Yes.

523
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,820
I've always liked cutting wood,

524
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,070
whittling wood and carving wood.

525
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,710
I've made a lot of wood carvings.

526
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,830
I really admire that.

527
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,790
But

528
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,500
why do you want to be the chief executive?

529
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,820
To be honest,

530
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,070
I just think it's an easy job.

531
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,510
I'm good at easy work.

532
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,030
Sir, you're really straightforward.

533
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,430
But we've already had Wang Sheng

534
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,510
as the chief executive in Wood Feather.

535
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,230
Do you want to be our general director?

536
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,590
It's a powerful position

537
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,990
and it's a perfect job for you,

538
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,990
who's strong and powerful.

539
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,260
Stop it.

540
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,790
The general director is in charge of other directors,

541
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,270
and has to manage the work on site.

542
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,230
It's both annoying and tiring.

543
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,150
I don't think this job suits me.

544
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,940
Wood Feather House doesn't hire slackers.

545
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,550
Who did you just say?

546
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,350
He doesn't mean it.

547
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,830
You're good at both civil and martial matters.

548
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,710
You're courageous and prudent.

549
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,350
But our Wood Feather is so small

550
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,070
that it's not worth your while to work for us.

551
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,150
Sir, please eat this.

552
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,230
Let's eat.

553
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,270
What do you mean?

554
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,270
I...

555
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,350
You want me to be the general director?

556
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,070
I'll do it.

557
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,510
I really appreciate how straightforward you are.

558
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,060
Now with you as the general director,

559
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,910
we only need a supervisor

560
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,310
before we can fill all the vacancies

561
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,710
in Wood Feather.

562
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,070
I believe before long,

563
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,470
the work will come to us.

564
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,750
Mr. Luo, how did you know that? We do have new work.

565
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,590
Tomorrow morning,

566
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,310
the employer will come here and discuss with us.

567
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,470
Miss Chen is indeed a lucky star of Wood Feather House.

568
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,870
All right.

569
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,030
Let's eat.

570
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,530
[Wood Feather House]

571
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,830
Who? Who are you?

572
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,590
Come out!

573
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:15,790
Come out!

574
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,270
Is it this way?

575
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,030
Take a look here. Let's go.

576
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,650
[Wood Feather House]

577
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,620
Where did she go?

578
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,990
Where is she? Bro.

579
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,820
That way. Go.

580
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,350
Did a woman enter your yard?

581
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,510
Our Wood Feather craftsmen team

582
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,830
will answer your question before you pay two taels of silver.

583
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,980
You...

584
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,270
I mean, did you see a beautiful woman

585
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,670
in pink, and about this tall.

586
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,950
I see.

587
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,670
So many of you.

588
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,150
You must have a big project to consult us, right?

589
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,910
Well,

590
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,150
if you ask ten questions,

591
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,150
I'll answer another two for free.

592
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,180
No...

593
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,670
Come in. Come in.

594
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,470
Come in.

595
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,580
Let's go.

596
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,430
Don't go.

597
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,630
I can give you a discount.

598
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,500
Come out. They're all gone.

599
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,310
Thank you.

600
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,710
You're welcome.

601
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,950
Those people are...

602
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,670
May I have your name?

603
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,950
My name is Han Niaoniao.

604
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,910
I met Miss Chen yesterday.

605
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,230
I have a job for you.

606
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,670
It's you.

607
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,350
I wonder

608
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,310
what exactly you want us to do.

609
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,510
I want you to renovate a shanty.

610
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,590
A shanty?

611
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,670
It's fine.

612
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,310
Miss Han. You can tell us in detail.

613
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,270
Yesterday, Miss Chen and Mr. Meng met Tongtong.

614
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,430
Yes.

615
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,750
That kid is so cute.

616
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,510
I want to ask you

617
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,910
to renovate the shanty of Tongtong's family.

618
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,220
Tongtong is living with her grandma.

619
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,750
They're impoverished.

620
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,390
Now their shanty is crumbling.

621
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,430
It can't even protect them from the wind and rain.

622
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,430
Miss,

623
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,150
how much is the budget of materials

624
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,950
and construction?

625
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,270
To be honest,

626
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,230
we don't have money.

627
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,550
I saw Miss Chen post a recruitment notice yesterday.

628
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,630
I also heard something about your craftsman team.

629
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,420
So I thought you may need a job

630
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,630
to restore your reputation.

631
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,590
The renovation of Tongtong's house is a very small project

632
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,350
without any complex design and construction.

633
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,150
If you take this kind deed as your first protect,

634
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,470
your reputation will surely be restored.

635
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,180
That makes sense.

636
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,590
What makes sense?

637
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,820
She wants us to work for free.

638
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,070
Miss.

639
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,350
Please wait a moment.

640
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,870
Qingfeng, come with me.

641
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,310
Just say it to her.

642
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,990
Why do you have to talk here?

643
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,630
Forget it.

644
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,150
Just tell me whether you want to take this job or not.

645
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,630
The renovation of the shanty

646
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,990
doesn't interest me at all.

647
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,750
So you don't want to take it?

648
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,390
If you have any ideas,

649
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,870
you can tell me.

650
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,990
Look at you.

651
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,070
You can't do this.

652
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,100
You should stick to your ambitions.

653
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,230
Though we have acquired

654
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,030
considerable financial support from the Zhao family,

655
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,830
and we're more confident now,

656
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,700
if we take this kind of unpaid job,

657
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,190
the reopening of Wood Feather House will be a joke.

658
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,660
It makes sense.

659
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,830
You can just tell her that.

660
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,070
I won't object.

661
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,270
Wait.

662
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,070
I think

663
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,550
it's better for you to tell her.

664
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,390
You're the decision-maker, aren't you?

665
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,110
Why do you ask me to tell her instead?

666
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,630
I want you to tell her not because

667
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,510
I'm worried about Miss Han.

668
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,550
Miss Han, you are not from Lin'an, are you?

669
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,310
What are you talking about?

670
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,270
I was asking Miss Han about herself.

671
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,310
My parents are not in Lin'an.

672
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,950
I'm a maid of a lady.

673
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,070
I have very little income

674
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,990
but I manage to support myself.

675
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,190
I'm sorry.

676
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,390
Since Master likes you,

677
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,190
how about working for my family?

678
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,950
I will be a good boss.

679
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,710
Meng Yuanxu. Don't interrupt us.

680
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,870
Mr. Luo. Architect Li.

681
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,270
Miss Han is a poor girl,

682
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,030
but she is willing to help Tongtong.

683
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,110
This is the right thing to do.

684
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,270
Now what she asks us to do them a favor,

685
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,310
we must help them.

686
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,110
Miss Han.

687
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,590
We understand your difficulty.

688
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,230
But now the Wood Feather has just reopened,

689
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,350
we need to take projects that can prove our capabilities.

690
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,710
This is also our difficulty.

691
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,070
Therefore,

692
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,390
I'm really sorry.

693
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,630
I see.

694
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,190
Sorry to bother you.

695
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,620
Architect Li.

696
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,350
Miss Han is making a living in Lin'an alone

697
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,550
but she's still kind enough to help those in need.

698
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,150
You are a man.

699
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,430
Why don't you show your kindness as well?

700
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,910
Everyone has their own difficulties.

701
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,870
The chance for Wood Feather to reopen

702
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,830
was also hard to come by.

703
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,990
If we make any mistake again, who will take the consequences?

704
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,830
You don't have to argue because of me.

705
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,390
I was too abrupt.

706
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,540
Architect Li.

707
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,270
Wood Feather House is not just yours.

708
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,710
I'm the architect.

709
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,230
Yes, you're just an architect.

710
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,390
Mr. Luo, you are the boss.

711
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,190
What do you think?

712
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,510
Guys.

713
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,630
Calm down. Calm down.

714
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,430
Let's sit down and talk.

715
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,550
Miss Han, please sit down.

716
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,030
We'll help.

717
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,510
Of course we'll help.

718
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,630
What I appreciate the most

719
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,150
is kindness.

720
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,380
Among other things,

721
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,910
just for your kindness,

722
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,190
we'll help you.

723
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,430
Great.

724
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,100
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

725
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,070
Architect Li, did you hear that?

726
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,430
Not everyone of Wood Feather House

727
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,030
is as cold-blooded as you.

728
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,030
Li Qingfeng, even your best friend agreed.

729
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,030
What else do you want to say?

730
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,390
Qingfeng, if you have any concerns,

731
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,590
you can tell me.

732
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,270
Even if you agree,

733
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,750
our team is still short of a supervisor.

734
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,950
In any case,

735
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,340
you can't start the work without a supervisor.

736
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,870
You're right.

737
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,990
How could I forget that?

738
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,310
It's true.

739
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,820
I can be the supervisor for now.

740
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,390
Miss Han, this is a serious matter.

741
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,350
Supervisor is different from other workers.

742
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,550
Only when you have very professional knowledge

743
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,510
can you be qualified.

744
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,870
I know. I'm not joking.

745
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,150
Please trust me, Architect Li.

746
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,830
According to the national rules of construction,

747
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,830
The size of the house is measured by cai.

748
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,150
Cai has eight levels.

749
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,300
We should choose different level of cai

750
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,830
according to the size and level of the house.

751
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,790
Therefore, how many materials are needed

752
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,710
for the pillars of Palaces, Halls and Remaining Rooms?

753
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,430
The Palaces use materials from 2 cai 2 qi to 3 cai.

754
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,950
The Halls use materials of 2 cai 1 qi.

755
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,470
The Remaining Rooms use materials from 1 cai 1 qi to 2 cai.

756
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,590
How about the size of pillars?

757
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,510
In terms of the size of pillars,

758
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,950
the corner pillar stands when it reaches the corner and it depends on the number of rooms.

759
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
If there are 13 rooms,

760
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,350
the corner pillar is 1 chi 2 cun taller than the flat pillar.

761
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,950
If there are 11 rooms, 8 cun taller.

762
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,270
7 rooms, 6 cun taller.

763
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,630
5 rooms, 4 cun taller.

764
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,550
3 rooms, 2 cun taller.

765
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,710
You have experience as a supervisor?

766
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,350
I worked with my father since I was young.

767
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,710
So I know a thing or two,

768
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,150
about architecture supervision.

769
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,790
I also worked as a supervisor for three years.

770
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,790
So I know how to do it.

771
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,780
Great! Miss Han.

772
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,470
Architect Li.

773
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,070
You won't disapprove now, will you?

774
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,390
It's like that people who want to cross the river meet a boat.

775
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,470
What a coincidence!

776
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,950
I didn't expect that

777
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,190
Miss Han is so talented.

778
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,030
You are destined to

779
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,110
meet us in the Wood Feather House.

780
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,950
In that case, this work...

781
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,350
We'll go and take a look first.

782
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,030
If everything goes well,

783
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,630
we'll take the job.

784
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,310
Thank you, Mr. Luo. Thank you, Miss Chen.

785
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,230
Thank you, everyone.

786
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,750
Tongtong?

787
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,910
Tongtong.

788
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,870
Sister Han.

789
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,470
Grandma.

790
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,150
Sister Han is here!

791
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,140
Grandma.

792
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,150
Niaoniao.

793
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,510
Who are these people?

794
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,630
They are from Wood Feather craftsman team.

795
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,750
Craftsman team?

796
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,620
What are they doing here?

797
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,470
Miss Han said she would show us around

798
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,430
to help renovate the house.

799
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,830
So we come here.

800
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,150
Niaoniao.

801
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,990
This house is pretty nice.

802
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,740
No need to fix it.

803
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,430
No need to fix it.

804
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,830
Let them have a look. It's fine.

805
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,670
We just want to have a look.

806
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,510
We won't do anything else.

807
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,750
May I?

808
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,390
Sure. Sure. Please.

809
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,820
[Three Character Classic]

810
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,950
The window is broken.

811
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,990
How do you sleep?

812
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,790
It's stuffy.

813
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,020
With some fresh air, we can sleep.

814
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,740
OK guys. This is their home.

815
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,310
Can you renovate it?

816
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,710
Qingfeng.

817
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,950
What do you think?

818
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,750
Why are you pulling me out?

819
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,790
When you see them,

820
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,110
don't you feel sorry for them?

821
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,230
I do feel sorry for them.

822
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,590
But there are so many poor people out there.

823
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm just an architect.

824
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,350
I should only do my job.

825
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,870
Tell me now.

826
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,989
What should you do now?

827
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,030
I've checked this place.

828
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,150
I'm not interested in the renovation.

829
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,750
Its renovation won't benefit

830
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,190
Wood Feather House at all.

831
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,830
You have no heart.

832
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,860
If I show off my kindness everywhere,

833
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,870
Wood Feather House will close soon.

834
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,710
What do you mean?

835
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,909
Do you think I'm showing off kindness?

836
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,070
Li Qingfeng.

837
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,350
You don't deserve to be an architect.

838
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,150
You promise Miss Han to come and have a look before making the decision.

839
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,909
Since you entered the door,

840
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,350
you looked bored and aloof.

841
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,510
How would Miss Han, grandma

842
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,190
and Mr. Luo feel about that?

843
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,469
It doesn't matter how I looked like.

844
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,739
What matters is I've seen this house

845
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,190
and thought

846
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,870
Wood Feather House doesn't need to take this job.

847
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,389
Have you really seen it carefully?

848
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,030
You only saw the leakage on the roof,

849
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,790
but you didn't see that blooming flower.

850
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,350
You only saw the broken room,

851
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,590
but you didn't see the desk under the sun.

852
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,070
You only see the broken window,

853
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,430
but you didn't see that

854
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,350
even under such a circumstance,

855
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,110
they're still trying to live a good life.

856
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,310
You only saw this shoddy shanty,

857
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,630
but you didn't see that

858
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,950
it's all they have.

859
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,870
She's the greatest architect

860
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,060
in the world.

861
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,550
But you

862
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,830
don't deserve to be an architect.

863
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,710
Qingfeng.

864
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,870
Don't argue anymore.

865
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,110
We don't have to take this job.

866
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,980
I’ll tell Miss Han now.

867
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,390
We'll take it.

868
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,070
What?

869
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,350
Tell them that

870
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,070
Wood Feather House

871
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,950
will take the work.

872
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,350
OK, I’ll tell them now.

873
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,190
Well...

874
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,150
Mr. Luo.

875
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,590
I understand.

876
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,110
Let me see you off.

877
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,510
Let's go.

878
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,510
Miss Han, you don’t understand.

879
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,790
We're going to take this job.

880
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,350
Really?

881
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,150
Since everyone is here,

882
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,630
let me introduce her.

883
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,590
This is the benefactor

884
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,950
of our Wood Feathe House.

885
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,350
Zhao Yining. Miss Zhao.

886
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,350
She is also the co-owner of Wood Feather.

887
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,470
From now on, we are a family.

888
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,350
That's why you look familiar.

889
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,830
You’re Zhao Xian’s daughter, right?

890
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,990
Hello, Mr. Meng.

891
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,590
Well,

892
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,230
I'm not in charge of any of your projects.

893
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,150
So you don't have to be cautious with me around.

894
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,230
Just treat me as your friend.

895
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,630
But

896
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,870
I have another identity.

897
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,110
My second identity is

898
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,670
Li Qingfeng’s admirer.

899
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,830
Li Qingfeng, you are really something.

900
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,270
Do you have to tell them that?

901
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,590
Of course yes.

902
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,390
I'll come and see you often.

903
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,390
If I don't make it clear,

904
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,070
it will cause many misunderstandings.

905
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,070
Am I right?

906
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,710
All right.

907
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,110
Mr. Luo will take care of the rest.

908
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,870
I won't talk.

909
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,350
The first thing is done.

910
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,870
Let me tell you the second one.

911
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,350
Grandma.

912
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,270
Grandma.

913
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,030
Grandma. Grandma.

914
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,870
What happened?

915
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,630
Get up. Be careful, grandma.

916
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,230
Come on.

917
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,220
Slow down.

918
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,990
Grandma, come here.

919
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,830
Grandma. Sit here. Slow down.

920
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,590
Don't cry.

921
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,670
What happened?

922
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,510
That butcher

923
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,590
robbed our ten taels of silver.

924
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,270
What?!

925
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,310
He's such a bully!

926
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,110
He bosses people around in the South City,

927
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,790
who picks on peddlers

928
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,470
and trades by coercion.

929
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,550
His pork shop

930
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,030
was seized from Mr. Liu by force.

931
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,070
And he broke one leg of Mr. Liu

932
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,630
because of that.

933
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,190
But no one can do anything about him.

934
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,070
Why don't you report it to the court?

935
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,550
He doesn't care.

936
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,110
It's useless to report it.

937
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,870
This is ridiculous.

938
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,590
