4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,710
The more I look at you, the more I like you.

5
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,990
Don't be shy.

6
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,710
Sooner or later, you'll be a member of the Meng family.

7
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,110
Yuanxu,

8
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,300
you should bring Luo home more often to visit me

9
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,669
so that I can communicate more with my future daughter-in-law.

10
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,460
Do you hear me?

11
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,150
Yes, mother.

12
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,870
Some of the plants can't be watered too much.

13
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,470
Be careful. Or you'll get them withered.

14
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,870
Luo,

15
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,870
stay here if you’re free today.

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,980
Tomorrow is my birthday.

17
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,310
All of my husband's friends will come.

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,380
They love Yuanxu very much.

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,350
So I'm sure they will like you as well.

20
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,110
Mother,

21
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,070
that's really not necessary.

22
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,829
There's a new project in the Wood Feather House.

23
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,910
So we're very busy.

24
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,710
We won’t join you tomorrow.

25
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,310
Since he met you, Luo,

26
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,630
Yuanxu has really become more steady.

27
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,310
He's filial and righteous.

28
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,630
As her mother,

29
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,350
I really have to thank you.

30
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
It's not like that, Madam.

31
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,710
He's always been a good man.

32
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,070
I truly helped nothing in that.

33
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,750
Look.

34
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,390
You're so humble.

35
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,070
Yuanxu,

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,300
it seems that it has been useful for me

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,390
to burn incense and worship the gods these years.

38
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,790
The gods really have given me such a good daughter-in-law.

39
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,070
I think you two

40
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,190
are really destined to be together.

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,510
Yuanxu, come here.

42
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,950
Great!

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,230
This is really great!

44
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,870
I'm really enjoying

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,829
this year's birthday.

46
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,150
Um... mother,

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,300
we still have work to do,

48
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,590
see you.

49
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,590
Bye.

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,350
Madam, take care.

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,230
You haven’t finished watering the flowers.

52
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,390
Luo, come often.

53
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,710
Such a plump girl...

54
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,149
She can definitely give birth to lots of babies.

55
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,300
Ning,

56
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,110
didn't you say you went to Wood Feather House?

57
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,470
I've been there.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,190
Has Li Qingfeng changed his attitude towards you?

59
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,909
I don't know.

60
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,430
Maybe yes or maybe no.

61
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,790
Then at present, you should

62
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,110
stay in the Wood Feather House.

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,430
He needs to work.

64
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,390
Why would I stay there?

65
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,310
To make him get sick of me?

66
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,990
You are too careless.

67
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,550
I'm born to be careless.

68
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,820
Always being cautious these days

69
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,230
actually makes me

70
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,190
feel not at ease.

71
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,950
Why?

72
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,750
This may be my last chance.

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,950
So I should be myself.

74
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,310
Brother,

75
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,670
I want to race against you.

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,590
OK.

77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,540
Come on, let’s have a race.

78
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,950
Let's go.

Miss Zhao.

80
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,870
Miss Zhao.

81
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,750
Mr. Zhang, why are you here?

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,950
I brought this fine horse to Miss Zhao

83
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,790
to express my apology.

84
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,910
We were about to have a horse race, and then you're here with a horse.

85
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,430
What a coincidence.

86
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,030
Is this the seventh son of Lord Zhao?

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,310
Nice to meet you.

88
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,270
Forgive me for my ignorance.

89
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,870
Do we know each other?

90
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,550
Many years ago,

91
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,510
my father and I have met you

92
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
in a gathering.

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,460
Just one time.

94
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,990
It’s normal that you don’t remember.

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,540
I see.

96
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,510
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,990
Mr. Zhang,

98
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,870
do you think I lack horses?

99
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,230
Miss Zhao,

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,270
don't get me wrong.

101
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,780
I'm here to give you the horse to apologize.

102
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,270
When we first met,

103
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,630
I was in a rude manner.

104
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,510
So I feel sorry for that.

105
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,909
I hope you can accept this horse

106
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,710
and forgive me.

107
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,909
No need. Take it back.

108
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,190
Brother, let's go racing.

109
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,190
No hurry.

110
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,630
Since you're here to send the horse

111
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,030
to express your apology,

112
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,870
I can feel your sincerity.

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,790
That's right.

114
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,710
OK.

115
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,390

117
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,510
I raised this horse myself

118
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
and it's my favorite horse.

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,710
Good!

120
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,630
This is really a fine horse.

121
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,070
We shall keep it!

122
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,310

126
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,270
Since this horse is Mr. Zhang's favorite horse

127
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,790
and the Zhao family

128
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,990
never stripes others of their beloved things,

129
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,630
how about

130
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,510
leaving it in our racecourse?

131

We'll help you raise the horse.

It's good to keep in touch.

Ning,

139
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,390
how do you think about it?

140
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,670
If you want to raise it, then do it yourself!

141
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,310
So it's to the satisfaction of all.

142

Mr. Zhang, you're just in time.

143
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,070
How about we have a horse racing together?

144
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,100
I only want to race with you, brother.

145
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,790
Miss Zhang, don’t worry.

Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Zhao.

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,990
That's great.

193
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,030
Madam.

194
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,950
You must be hungry.

195
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,510
What do you want to eat? I'll cook for you.

196
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,750
It's okay. I don't want to eat.

197
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,350
Thank you.

198
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,300
What's wrong with her?

199
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,110
What are you looking at?

200
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,230
They are here.

201
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,710
Follow me.

202
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,470
This...

203
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,830
What happened?

204
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,350
Get in.

205
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,950
What happened?

206
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,630
Officers,

207
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
what would you like to eat?

208
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,270
Please come in.

209
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,950
Have you seen this lady?

210
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,270
Maybe?

211
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,070
Really?

212
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,060
Maybe not.

213
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,820
Anyway, I think

214
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,390
she is pretty.

215
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,430
Why do you say she's pretty every time you see a girl?

216
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
Because she really is pretty.

217
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,150
You were somewhat pretty 20 years ago.

218
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,990
What 20 years ago?

219
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,270
I mean...

220
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,150
Let these officers take a look at you.

221
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,350
-She's an old lady now. -Go over there.

222
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,270
What old lady?

223
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,700
Look in the mirror.

224
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,870
You are such an old man.

225
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,550
Now I see every girl

226
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,110
is pretty.

227
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,750
Any other girl is prettier than you.

228
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,470
You're not even close to pretty. You're old.

229
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,750
What is this place for?

230
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,030
It's so small here.

231
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,030
Is this the place you used to live in?

232
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,990
This was my own little world

233
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,900
when I was young.

234
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,430
Your little world?

235
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,030
Every time when creditors came to ask for payment of debts,

236
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,870
my mother would hide me here.

237
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,670
Then I would hide here the whole day.

238
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,230
So in my childhood,

239
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,230
I spent most of my time here.

240
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,670
This abacus...

241
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,110
My father bought it

242
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,710
when he was still wealthy.

243
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,030
At that time, I wanted to study business with him.

244
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,470
But my dad told me

245
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,030
I could just become a deputy governor if I only learn abacus.

246
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,030
If i want to be a boss,

247
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,430
i have to forget the rules and principles for the abacus,

248
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,590
and accept the world's unjust

249
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,870
and unreasonable part.

250
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,310
Your servants are quite stubborn.

251
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,110
It seems that they won't leave for now.

252
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:47,990
Let's sit down and talk.

253
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,870
This carpenter knife

254
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,030
was given by Qingfeng

255
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,140
when my family was in straitened circumstances.

256
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,750
He didn't ask me to hurt people with it.

257
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,270
He just wanted me to protect myself with it.

258
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,030
In those years,

259
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,150
my only friend

260
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,390
was Qingfeng.

261
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,670
I think everyone in the Wood Feather House

262
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,150
envies your friendship very much.

263
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,030
Even I envy him

264
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,310
of having such a good friend like me.

265
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,630
God actually blessed me.

266
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,350
He let me have my best friend

267
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,620
and my best partner.

268
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,030
Niaoniao,

269
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,310
we can anyhow figure out a way to deal with them.

270
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,350
Since I was born

271
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,910
I've been facing problems,

272
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,430
and solving them everyday.

273
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,390
Don't worry.

274
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,990
As long as I'm here,

275
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,470
no one

276
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,630
can take you away from me.

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,830
I have no idea.

278
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,590
Architect Li, are you working?

279
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,150
I'm thinking.

280
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,180
Then give me something

281
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,550
and let me think about it.

282
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,470
You choose.

283
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,350
Is this

284
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,710
the little wooden horse

285
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,150
that Master Yu once mentioned?

286
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,140
Yes.

287
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,470
His cutting skill is quite different from yours.

288
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,550
It's of less sharpness but more smoothness.

289
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,590
Good skill!

290
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,230
It seems that you father is also a skilled craftsman.

291
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,390
This craftsman has been waiting for you all morning.

292
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,540
But you had no will to meet him at all.

293
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,430
It seems that he doesn't deserve your respect.

294
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,270
Don't get all sarcastic.

295
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,580
Why are you always

296
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,830
talking about this?

297
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,910
Because till now,

298
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,630
I'm still kept in the dark.

299
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,110
Then keep being in the dark.

300
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,590
You...

301
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,070
Why are you in this attitude?

302
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,390
What attitude?

303
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,070
Look at your attitude to me.

304
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,750
My attitude depends on you.

305
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,380
But have I ever asked you to yell at me?

306
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,630
Yell at you?

307
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,230
Of course you've forgotten it.

308
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,110
You always looked fierce

309
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,980
since the Zhongyuan Festival.

310
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,990
Am I also fierce now?

311
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,550
Is there any sweet talk now?

312
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,590
I can't tell.

313
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,550
You hid something from me first,

314
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,870
but now you're blaming me.

315
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,070
Is there any justice?

316
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,830
Then just do what you think is fair.

317
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,030
I don't care.

318
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,110
Okay, I won't argue with you.

319
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,110
I can strictly separate the work from my own mood.

320
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,030
Then tell me,

321
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,710
what have you come up with after thinking this time?

322
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,750
Nothing.

323
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,510
The sketches Mr. Zhang brought

324
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,910
include all kinds of architecture of the Xiao Dynasty.

325
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,310
But none of them

326
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,990
is the most beautiful house Miss. Zhang wants.

327
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,390
So we can only go to Zhang's Mansion tonight

328
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,510
to see Miss Zhang's mental condition.

329
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,430
Deputy Architect Chen,

330
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,670
are you working?

331
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,270
I'm thinking.

332
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,470
Thank you for your kindness.

333
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,350
You even invited a doctor to take a look at my daughter.

334
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,550
Of course.

335
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,190
Since we took this project,

336
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,790
then we should try our best to help Miss Zhang.

337
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,150
That's great.

338
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,470
But this doctor...

339
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,510
I have never seen him before.

340
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,910
I think...

341
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,630
I'm familiar with all the famous doctors

342
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,270
in Lin'an City.

343
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,110
This doctor is from my home.

344
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,910
This doctor specially takes care of Lord Meng's health?

345
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,630
Exactly.

346
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,990
Thank you so much.

347
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,950
No need.

348
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,910
Let Dr. Lin diagnose first.

349
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,270
OK.

350
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,670
Good.

351
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,270
Miss,

352
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,670
your pulse is stable and your body is fine.

353
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,350
But

354
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,350
I have a question.

355
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,830
Do you think you have forgotten something?

356
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,590
What do you mean?

357
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,230
I'm fine, so I have never forgotten anything.

358
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,020
It's safe. You can come out now.

359
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,710
Thank you, Madam.

360
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,670
Darling.

361
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,710
Don't worry. It's safe.

362
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,390
Father.

363
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,590
it’s getting late.

364
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,910
It's time for us to go back.

365
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,790
Where can you go?

366
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,990
They are all watching outside.

367
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,390
Listen to your father.

368
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,550
They may know you are nearby,

369
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,870
and they have people observing at all intersections.

370
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,190
You can't go out today.

371
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,870
Yes.

372
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,069
Then where can Niaoniao go?

373
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,430
There are so many rooms upstairs.

374
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,589
She can rest in any one of them.

375
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,790
Don't worry.

376
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,510
Niaoniao,

377
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,990
I've cleaned up a room,

378
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,150
and prepared new quilt and pillow.

379
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,430
Let's go up and have a look.

380
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,190
Go.

381
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,869
Madam, I...

382
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,510
Listen to me.

383
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,550
-Just listen to me. -Mother.

384
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:22,950
Let's go.

385
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,829
Stop looking.

386
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,470
Have a drink with me

387
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,910
and tell me

388
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,310
about you and Miss Han.

389
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,150
Come with me.

390
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,190
Dad.

391
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,950
You...

392
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,430
Let's go.

393
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,150
Go.

394
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,460
[Zhang's Mansion]

395
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,750
Who are you?

396
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,590
I'm Li Qingfeng from the Wood Feather House.

397
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,590
Please inform your Master.

398
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,950
Architects,

399
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,470
what brings you here at this hour?

400
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,910
Mr. Zhang,

401
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,310
Dr. Lin said

402
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,430
Miss Zhang was fine.

403
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,630
But she doesn’t remember Xu Qian at all.

404
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,710
So we are thinking

405
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,310
if her hysteria is related to memory loss.

406
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,030
So we came here at this hour.

407
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,030
Sorry to bother you.

408
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,150
Well...

409
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,670
It doesn't matter.

410
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,270
To be honest,

411
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,310
in our mansion,

412
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,270
it's not allowed to mention "Xu Qian".

413
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,470
Because we fear that she would get irritated.

414
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,550
Dr. Lin mentioned memory loss during the day,

415
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,870
and Fu had no response.

416
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,470
But don’t mention it at night.

417
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,710
If any accident happens,

418
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,750
the consequences will be disastrous.

419
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,630
OK.

420
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,270
Architect Chen is a girl.

421
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,710
So it’s more convenient for her to talk with Fu.

422
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,910
I’ll keep an eye on her.

423
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,390
Thank you, Miss Chen.

424
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,430
Don't worry.

425
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,030
Come with me.

426
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,580
It's the same every day at this time.

427
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,150
Every time I tell her to go back to her room,

428
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,950
she says that she wants to live in the most beautiful house in the world.

429
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,510
Fu.

430
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,670
Who are you?

431
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,470
My name is Chen Langyue.

432
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,550
Langyue...

433
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,070
Does it refer to the bright moon in the sky?

434
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,550
The moon is made of tears.

435
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,670
What?

436
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,350
Look, it's flowing.

437
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,070
It's flowing...

438
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,750
Is there a palace on the moon?

439
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,190
Moon palace?

440
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,830
Yes, there is.

441
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,590
Do you think the Moon Palace is beautiful?

442
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,790
Yes. It is.

443
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,710
Then... is it the most beautiful house in the world?

444
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,590
No.

445
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,710
It's not the most beautiful house in the world.

446
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,990
Alright, it's not.

447
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,990
In your mind,

448
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,950
what do you think is the most beautiful house?

449
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,590
Where is it?

450
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,740
What is it like?

451
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,310
Can you take me to the most beautiful house in the world?

452
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,350
Take me to the most beautiful house in the world.

453
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,230
Take me to the most beautiful house in the world!

454
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,310
Take me to the most beautiful house in the world!

455
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,670
-Fu. -Take me there.

456
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,790
Leave her to us. Go back to rest.

457
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,910
Take me there.

458
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,830
Take me to the most beautiful house in the world!

459
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,670
Fu! Fu!

460
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,270
Fu, calm down.

461
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,030
I’ll take you there.

462
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:25,990
Look.

463
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,470
Moon.

464
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,990
Don't worry.

465
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,670
Please.

466
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,470
Look.

467
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,670
Look at the moon.

468
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,070
The moon's tears are flowing.

469
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,990
Fu,

470
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,350
you want to live in the most beautiful house in the world, right?

471
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,670
I want to live in the most beautiful house in the world.

472
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,710
How many doors does it have?

473
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,830
Ten?

474
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,430
Ten?

475
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,190
No, no, no.

476
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,270
One hundred doors.

477
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,510
What does that house look like?

478
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,910
What does it look like?

479
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,950
It's...

480
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,310
like...

481
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,590
like this.

482
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,180
What should we do?

483
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,070
What does it look like?

484
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,790
How about...

485
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,270
We...

486
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,230
No.

487
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,830
Mr. Zhang clearly told us

488
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,830
not to mention him.

489
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,470
But this is the only breakthrough.

490
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,470
This is the most beautiful house in the world.

491
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,550
Don't let go of each other's hands.

492
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,550
Or it won't be the most beautiful house.

493
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,070
You mean... this is the most beautiful house in the world?

494
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,030
Yes, the most beautiful house.

495
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,750
Fu,

496
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,190
Xu Qian and you...

497
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,430
Fu!

498
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,070
Fu!

499
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,350
Fu!

500
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,310
Fu!

501
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,430
Fu! Fu!

502
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,190
What’s wrong?

503
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,710
My heart hurts.

504
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,030
What's wrong?

505
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,550
Xu Qian, who is he?

506
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,350
Nothing.

507
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,590
Who is Xu Qian?

508
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,830
Fu.

509
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,550
Do you remember him?

510
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,230
Who is Xu Qian?

511
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:20,990
Calm down.

512
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,790
Calm down.

513
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,430
Can you take me to Xu Qian?

514
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,580
I want to see him. I want to see him.

515
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,990
Can you take me to see him?

516
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,350
Take me to Xu Qian.

517
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,910
It's okay.

518
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,070
Calm down. Calm down.

519
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,070
Calm down.

520
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,030
Calm down, Fu.

521
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,070
Calm down.

522
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,260
It’s okay.

523
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,470
Your name is Chen Langyue?

524
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,550
What’s your name?

525
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,990
Li Qingfeng.

526
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,430
Li Qingfeng.

527
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,710
You must be together.

528
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,540
You must be together forever.

529
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,590
Otherwise, once you separate from each other,

530
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,310
you'll never be able to see each other again.

531
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,710
I'm going to find the most beautiful house in the world.

532
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,990
I'm going to find the most beautiful house.

533
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,750
The most beautiful house!

534
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,550
-I'm going to find the most beautiful house. -Fu.

535
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,190
-The most beautiful house in the world. -Fu.

536
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,430
The most beautiful house in the world.

537
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,830
The most beautiful house in the world.

538
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,710
I didn't expect that she came to Lin'an for escaping marriage.

539
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,220
That means

540
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,030
you haven't formalized your relationship?

541
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,230
We are sort of a couple now.

542
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,990
I mean getting married.

543
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,830
Do not worry.

544
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,750
I'll definitely marry her.

545
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm afraid it's her father who will come.

546
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,670
Think about it.

547
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,630
If your mother and I keep trying to stop you,

548
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,950
do you think you can successfully get married?

549
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,510
You can stop me as you like,

550
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,150
and we can still get married, can't we?

551
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,140
But have you ever thought about Miss Han?

552
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,310
If your father were still wealthy,

553
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,510
you wouldn’t have had so many worries.

554
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,630
Dad,

555
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,100
didn’t you insist that

556
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,420
you wanted to stay at this small restaurant

557
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,790
and live an idle life?

558
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,500
And it was useless to persuade you to make a comeback.

559
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,270
It's just a feeling.

560
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,790
There is nothing

561
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,670
worth worrying about.

562
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,590
Fight for whatever you want.

563
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,470
It's not difficult.

564
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,430
Brat,

565
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,350
what you said today

566
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,150
is like what your father said in those years.

567
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,070
You said it yourself.

568
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,390
Fill it up.

[Making silk and satin garments all year round.]

570
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,830
I...

571
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,470
You first.

572
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,390
I think the most beautiful house in Miss Zhang's eyes

573
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,430
must have something to do with Xu Qian.

574
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,110
But now,

575
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,060
we can't stimulate her anymore with the name "Xu Qian".

576
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,550
At least we can't do it again

577
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,510
before there's improvement in her sleep.

578
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,000
[Meat Noodles]

579
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,310
That makes the two of us.

580
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,670
Let’s go back and ask Boss Luo

581
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,740
what information he has found.

582
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,940
Then we can find another breakthrough.

583
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,990
That's all we can do now.

584
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,430
It's raining.

585
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:54,830
Let's go.

586
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,110
Lady’s not back yet...

587
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,910
Luo, where are you going?

588
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,310
She hasn’t come back. I’ll go find her.

589
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,150
Let me go with you.

590
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,350
Why does the rain come so suddenly?

591
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,630
Move back a little bit.

592
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,870
My lady! My lady!

593
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,510
Maybe they're still in Zhang's Mansion.

594
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,270
Don't worry.

595
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,630
But it's so late.

596
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,030
They must have come out.

597
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,270
If my lady gets sick in the rain,

598
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,510
I really don't know

599
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,150
how many times I have to die to atone for my sin?

600
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,350
You are not the Dragon King.

601
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,910
How can you be to blame for raining!

602
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,590
Don’t worry.

603
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,750
Li Qingfeng is with her.

604
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,540
If my Master really gets sick in the rain,

605
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,990
I'll punish him first.

606
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,870
Let me hold an umbrella for you.

607
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,470
Let’s go over there.

608
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,390
What are you doing?

609
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,910
If you get a cold,

610
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,710
the project will be delayed.

611
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,670
Why would it have anything to do with you?

612
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,190
Go away!

613
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,820
If you get a cold, then we can only abandon the project.

614
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,790
Go away!

615
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,430
Master.

616
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,310
Are they there?

617
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,030
Bastard, Li Qingfeng.

618
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,350
Sir!

619
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,510
You will catch a cold.

620
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,550

-Sir! -What are you doing?

623
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,070
I did see that he conducted indecent assault on you!

624
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,270
How does he look like

625
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,550
he's conducting indecent assault on me?

626
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,230
Luo, did you see that?

627
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,750
I…

628
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,070
I thought you were

629
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,150
a righteous person.

630
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,910
I didn't expect that you're actually so shameless and nasty.

631
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,910
Master,

632
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,630
listen to me,

633
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,950
let's leave this damn Wood Feather House.

634
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,030
Haven't you heard what I said?

635
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,870
He was just blocking the rain for me.

636
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,670
Impossible.

637
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,550
If he was blocking the rain for you,

638
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,030
then why did you push him away?

639
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,870
I didn't want him to get wet.

640
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,070
He should get wet.

641
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,550
He doesn't match you for your identity is...

642
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,310

643
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,990
Are you done?

644
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,700
No.

645
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,070
I have long wanted to make this clear.

646
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,310
I just don't understand,

647
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,190
I treat you so well,

648
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,710
but you chose Li Qingfeng!

649
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,430
He always makes you angry

650
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,990
but you refuse to give me a chance!

651
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,070
Don't you know

652
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,950
you can't have a relationship with him?

653
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,070
What are you thinking?

654
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,540
It's none of your business.

655
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,190
It must be my business.

656
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,630
Then leave the Wood Feather House!

657
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,630
Fine!

My lady, I'm sorry.

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,710
It seems that official Meng truly has affection for you.

667
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,590
What do you mean?

668
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,950
I used to think he was just on impulse.

669
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,430
Unexpectedly,

670
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,350
he has been so obsessed with you.

671
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,870
What about you?

Go back.

678
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,340
Come back together with me.

679
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,590
Why should I go back?

680
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,710
Even princess wants to kick me out now,

681
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,110
then what's the point of me going back?

682
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,350
No one in the world cares about me.

683
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,190
Then I'd rather die on my own!

684
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,470
But I care.

685
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,950
Besides,

686
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,710
my lady didn't really mean to kick you out.

687
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,310
It's just that the one she likes is not you.

688
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,350
But she still regards you as her best,

689
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,830

690
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,870
Sir,

691
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,900
in this world, if you love her,

692
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,270
it doesn't mean that she must be with you.

693
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,390
Think about it,

694
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,470
has she ever done anything bad to you?

695
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,590
But you don't understand the pain

696
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,590
that the one you love doesn't love you.

697
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,990
How can I not understand?

698
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,470
You're finally back.

-My lady. -Come in.

700
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,390

701
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,310
You're all wet.

702

Are you cold?

703
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,110
Come on. Take off your clothes.

704
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,030
I've prepared some hot water for you.

705
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:55,990
Come.

706
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,950
My Lady, this is inappropriate.

707
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,270
Be good.

My Lady.

710
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,910
Silly girl, don't cry.

711
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,110
Don't cry.

712
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,190
Are you sure you want to leave the Wood Feather House?

713
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,110
Do you want me to stay or not?

714
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,070
I will, of course, respect your decision.

715
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,300
But maybe Architect Chen

716
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,060
doesn't want you to leave.

717
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,990
How can what you think be the same as what my Master hopes!

718
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,950
Let me tell you now.

719
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,630
I shall keep staying inyour damn Wood Feather House.

720
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,990
If Master and Luo don’t leave,

721
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,470
I won’t leave either.

722
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,750
It's useless for you to kick me out.

723
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,030
I shouldn't have fought with you.

724
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,940
The rain has stopped.

725
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,070
This issue

726
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,950
should be left in the past.

727
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,310
Li Qingfeng...

728
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,310
No one in the world cares about me.

729
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,510
Then I'd rather die on my own!

730
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,710
But I care.

731
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,030
Good morning, Master.

732
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,270
It's you.

733
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,830
Master, it was my fault last night.

734
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,230
Take this snack as an apology, please.

735
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:36,190
Luo is the one that you should apologize to the most.

736
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,469
I know.

737
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,830
I’ve given these to Luo.

738
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,340
Then about what happened last night,

739
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,190
you should also apologize to Li Qingfeng.

740
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,469
I have already apologized to him when I came back last night.

741
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,350
I told him...

742
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,030
Official, you got up so early.

743
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,630
You also come back early.

744
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,469
Where did you two go last night?

745
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,590
I...

746
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,270
I shall go back to rest.

747
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,430
What are you...

748
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,060
Official!

749
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,550
It's not what you think it is.

750
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,190
How do you know what I'm thinking?

751
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,870
Do tell! Where did you go?

752
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,870
We didn't go anywhere.

753
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,830
We were just at my home.

754
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,870
Your home?

755
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,990
Impressive!

756
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,390
I mean... my parents' restaurant.

757
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,950
Miss Han and I rested in two different rooms.

758
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,870
Nothing happened between us.

759
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,020
Official!

760
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,270
You have to be careful with your words.

761
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,630
If it's heard by others,

762
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,950
how should Miss Han face people?

763
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,910
Alright.

764
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,870
Even if you two got married last night,

765
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,110
I wouldn't be surprised at all.

766
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,910
No...

767
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,390
By the way,

768
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,430
Boss Luo,

769
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,750
did you find anything from investigating Xu Qian yesterday?

770
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,550
We've gained a lot.

771
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,430
Tryst in a yard?

772
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,500
Yes.

773
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,790
I knew it.

774
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,110
So our speculation proves right.

775
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,070
What speculation?

776
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,870
Last night,

777
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,350
Architect Li and I met Miss Zhang.

778
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,830
As Councillor Zhang said,

779
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,870
Miss Zhang indeed has hysteria.

780
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,750
And when it broke out,

781
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,590
she would always say she wants to live in the most beautiful house in the world.

782
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,300
She also reacted fiercely when Xu Qian was mentioned.

783
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,150
With the key information you and Miss Han found,

784
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,670
it’s not hard to deduce that

785
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,910
Xu Qian's house

786
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,630
should be the most beautiful house in the world in her eyes.

787
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,230
I see...

788
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,420
That makes sense, doesn't it?

789
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,350
Master, how impressive

790
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,430
you solved the case in such short time!

791
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,780
Qingfeng, do you have any problem?

792
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,190
I'm afraid Architect Li thinks

793
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,070
if the most beautiful house in the world

794
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,350
is the small courtyard where Xu Qian lived when he was alive,

795
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,630
it will be meaningless,

796
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,150
and not interesting.

797
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,910
Luo, tell Councillor Zhang

798
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,630
to communicate with the landlord.

799
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,550
Tell them we will take Miss Zhang there tonight.

800
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,380
If it’s really like what Architect Chen said,

801
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,870
that would be the best.

802
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,750
OK.

803
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,350
Slowly.

804
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,710
Is this the place?

805
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,430
Yes.

806
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,430
Go inside please.

807
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,750
This house...

808
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,470
I seem to have been here before.

809
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,150
Fu.

810
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,150
Is this the most beautiful house in the world?

811
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,270
No.

812
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,710
This is not the most beautiful house in the world.

813
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,270
You can take a look more carefully.

814
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,590
Are you sure it's not?

815
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,830
The most beautiful house...

816
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,110
No, no, no.

817
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,830
Fu! Fu!

818
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,430
-It's not! -Fu.

819
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,710
-This isn't the most beautiful house in the world. -Fu!

820
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,110
Fu.

821
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,390
Where am I?

822
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,670
You lied to me.

823
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,350
Where am I?

824
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,190
Fu.

825
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,150
You lied to me.

826
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,670
This is not the most beautiful house.

827
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,710
Fu.

828
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,630
What’s wrong with her?

829
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,630
This is horrible.

830
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,550
Fu, don't be afraid.

831
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,190
Fu, you…

832
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,190
Don't be afraid, Fu.

833
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,180
Everyone,

834
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,870
I'm afraid you have to keep working on it.

835
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,870
Please don't give up.

836
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,950
Don't worry, Councillor Zhang.

837
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,430
We won’t…

838
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,710
Fu! Fu!

839
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,710
Go home with me.

840
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,710
Fu, don't be afraid.

841
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,190
Go.

842
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,070
Let's go.

843
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,270
Let's go home.

844
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,350
Go home.

845
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,230
Fu.

846
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,550
-Let’s go home. -You lied to me.

847
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,430
It's all right.

848
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,520
[Wood Feather House]

849
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,030
Qingfeng.

850
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,230
Why are you still up so late?

851
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,870
There must be something

852
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,900
that we overlooked.

853
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,540
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

854
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,030
This is life.

855
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,790
Difficulties abound, but I'm sure we can anyhow overcome them one by one.

856
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,870
I just think that many things don't make sense.

857
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,100
Why are you here?

858
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm just here to take a look at you.

859
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,470
How's your relationship with Miss Chen?

860
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,070
Why do you ask?

861
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,340
Because I’m curious.

862
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,660
Have you talked to her?

863
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,350
Have you resolved your misunderstanding?

864
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,430
You said

865
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,750
she knew clearly that she couldn't be with me.

866
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,870
What does that mean?

867
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,950
But you two are already together.

868
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,310
Qingfeng, I'm going to bed.

869
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,910
Miss Chen, see you.

870
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,070
I think there must be something

871
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,070
that we overlooked.

872
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,190
But what could it be...

873
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,670
Is that the reason why you are here?

874
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,710
Of course I don't know either.

875
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,990
I couldn't fall asleep.

876
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,870
I passed by

877
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,590
and found your light was still on.

878
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,300
So I came to ask you about it.

879
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,870
Why are you looking at this?

880
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,470
I...

881
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,190
I shall also go back to sleep.

882
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,950
But I just came here!

883
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,390
You are doing it on purpose!

884
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,270
Stinky wood!
