00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,990
Young man, what do you want to do?

190
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,670
I took the scissors

191
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,430
from Niaoniao's room.

192
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,390
Why don't you come with me,

193
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,350
and you'll know the real meaning of the scissors?

194
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,150
Please.

195
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,110
Excuse me, another pot of wine.

196
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,230
Got it!

197
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,150
[Han's Banking House]

198
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,830
I am Zhao Yunjie,

199
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,070
the second son of the Zhao family in Lin'an.

200
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,420
I want to talk to Boss Dong.

201
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,110
Mr. Zhao.

202
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,750
I brought the accountant

203
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,990
to do a good account with Boss Dong.

204
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,670
Please.

205
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,870
Boss Dong.

206
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,790
Have you thought about

207
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,990
what we discussed at noon?

208
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,910
It's indeed a good business.

209
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,790
But after thinking about it at noon,

210
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,460
I still have a little doubt.

211
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,660
I often meet the 7th son of the Zhao family

212
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,750
in Yangzhou.

213
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,060
But the second son...

214
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,750
It's understandable.

215
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,430
He does come to Yangzhou often.

216
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,070
Sometimes, Ning also comes with him.

217
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,630
I don't come often

218
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,950
because I'm always at Shouchun.

219
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,060
There's something wrong with his goldfish.

220
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,390
He has no appetite for food every day

221
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,470
and couldn't sleep at night.

222
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,670
My father had no choice

223
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,870
but to ask me to come.

224
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,620
I heard that he treats goldfish as his life.

225
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,710
In that case,

226
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,260
I understand now.

227
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,950
Ning was supposed to come this time,

228
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,470
but she recently invested

229
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,750
a craftsman team called Wood Feather House.

230
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,590
It is helping with the official expansion of the Fengjiang Tower.

231
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,670
So she has no time to come.

232
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,510
I heard that Miss Zhao is a genius in investment.

233
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,790
She is even doing business with the court now.

234
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,710
Recently, Ning fell in love with

235
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,190
an architect.

236
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,470
I'm afraid it's hard

237
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,070
to persuade him to marry into our family.

238
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,630
Men of our state have integrity.

239
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,820
Naturally, it's hard to persuade him.

240
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,910
But I heard that Boss Dong...

241
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,670
I...

242
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,830
Never mind.

243
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,670
Never mind.

244
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,020
Okay.

245
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,790
Let's not talk about these trivial matters.

246
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,470
Anyway,

247
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,180
I'll take you as the successor of the Han family.

248
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,380
Let's get down to business.

249
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,140
Are you going to do

250
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,710
the business of smuggling salt and iron?

251
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,590
The Han family started their business by doing building business,

252
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,110
and then they built the shops on their own,

253
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,380
becoming the largest trader in Yangzhou.

254
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,990
With huge quantities of goods coming in and out every day,

255
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,830
it shouldn't be difficult

256
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,230
to sell salt and iron.

257
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,550
But this is smuggling after all.

258
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,070
Zhao, do you understand what I mean?

259
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,710
Of course I understand your concern.

260
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,630
But you heard it just now.

261
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,310
Our family can

262
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,670
do business with the court.

263
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,270
We have our own ways and connections.

264
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,990
And I will try my best to put the Han family behind the scenes.

265
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,510
I won’t let those big shots

266
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,070
hear anything about the Han family.

267
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,390
Just make your money.

268
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,180
You can also make a lot of profits for the Han family.

269
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,270
Why not do it?

270
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,550
If it can be done successfully,

271
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,070
you can tell Mr. Han with confidence

272
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,390
that you'll marry his daughter

273
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,230
instead of marrying into the Han family.

274
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,030
I didn't expect you

275
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,830
have already seen through my thoughts.

276
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,990
So... You are in?

277
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,740
This is a big deal.

278
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,910
I think...

279
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,910
I think it's better to work with the Qi family.

280
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,030
The Qi family?

281
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,070
Yes.

282
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,750
To be honest,

283
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,460
I can't make decisions in the Han family.

284
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,950
But it's different in the Qi family.

285
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,390
In the Qi family,

286
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,950
I'm not a son-in-law

287
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,710
but a nephew.

288
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,910
Besides, Han Zhongzheng is so stubborn.

289
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,510
He won't work with us.

290
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,910
Long before Han Niaoniao appeared,

291
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,670
I had been with the eldest daughter of the Qi family.

292
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,350
And Mr. Qi helped me a lot.

293
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,590
He hid me and entrusted me with a important task.

294
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,830
He hoped that one day

295
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,030
I can lead the Qi family

296
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,590
to make it the richest family in Yangzhou.

297
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,580
But I heard that you

298
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,070
are going to marry Miss Han.

299
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,300
I can divorce her after we get married.

300
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
She can be downgraded as a concubine if we can't divorce.

301
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,030
We are all businessmen.

302
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,790
Zhao, don’t you understand?

303
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,150
You are indeed brilliant.

304
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,990
But I also heard that Mr. Han

305
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,150
also appreciates you, Boss Dong.

306
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,350
Nonsense.

307
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,790
He treats me as a dog of the Han family.

308
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,790
I can’t go west if he tells me to go east.

309
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,829
He's always ordering me.

310
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,670
Even if I have a baby, it'll have to surname Han.

311
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,710
If I hadn't deducted some money,

312
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,430
I would have starved to death in Han's mansion.

313
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,300
Mr. Han? Bullshit!

314
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,390
He's just a hateful old man.

315
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,900
Bastard.

316
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,589
I...

317
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,230
Bastard, you're going to jail!

318
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,830
You...

319
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,390
No, dad.

320
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,030
Listen to me.

321
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,060
My lord, we found Dong Dacheng’s ledger.

322
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,790
It has been sent to the government office.

323
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,390
Are you satisfied?

324
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,430
Isn't this what you want?

325
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,870
No.

326
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,630
What I want is Niaoniao.

327
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,990
Niaoniao.

328
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,310
You told me

329
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,590
Dong Dacheng was up to something.

330
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,510
But I didn’t listen to you.

331
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,710
You must be very sad.

332
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,990
Say something.

333
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,670
Uncle,

334
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,790
please give her some more time.

335
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,390
Yes, I am very sad.

336
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,990
Father, I've always listened to you since I was young.

337
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,350
I have never done anything against you.

338
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,190
But in the end, you would rather believe an outsider,

339
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,830
a villain who humiliated me.

340
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,750
I can’t accept it.

341
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,430
But...

342
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,460
But I did it for your own good.

343
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,070
I know you did it for me.

344
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,590
You asked me to eat

345
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,030
to grow up.

346
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,270
You asked me to play the guqin

347
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,550
to become virtuous.

348
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,550
You asked me to study supervision

349
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,030
to do business.

350
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,950
You asked me to marry Dong Dacheng

351
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,230
so that I won’t be wronged.

352
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,430
But, father,

353
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,990
did you ask me

354
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,830
if I want it or not?

355
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,020
So,

356
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,070
what you want is

357
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,590
to be a maid in Lin'an.

358
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,940
Yes.

359
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,350
I'm willing to live in Lin'an,

360
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,950
and go back to the Wood Feather House

361
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,590
to be with my friends.

362
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,070
I don't want to be controlled by you anymore.

363
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,550
I want to

364
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,190
be with Luo Ye

365
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,190
in this life.

366
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,070
Me... Me too.

367
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,070
I... I really want to.

368
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,510
My daughter,

369
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,830
I was wrong.

370
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,350
Father...

371
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,820
[Han's Mansion]

372
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,430
All right.

373
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,950
Let's go.

374
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,830

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,030
Wang Sheng personally sent the draft.

751
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,390
With the most experienced designer

752
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,670
in the Arrow-making House of the Ministry of War,

753
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,630
there will be no problem.

754
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,470
You are panic because you are hungry.

755
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,910
Finally, Miss Chen doesn't have to marry to Northern Zhou.

756
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,550
I think she must be very happy now.

757
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,430
I’ll ask Luo tomorrow.

758
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,950
Li Qingfeng, are you done packing?

759
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,590
Let’s go. I’ll treat you to a drink.

760
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,630
Have some supplements.

761
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,030
Officer, please let Qingfeng go.

762
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,230
He's really tired recently.

763
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,350
Let him have a good sleep.

764
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,710
Then you go with me.

765
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,830
No.

766
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,910
I was just kidding.

767
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,940
[Thorough survey of curves and lines]

768
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,270
After him!

769
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,830
Minister Zheng,

770
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,950
tell me how to calm down.

771
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,590
Wang Sheng.

772
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,270
You left the palace secretly.

773
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,510
How did you expose your whereabouts?

774
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,870
The Northern Zhou secretly inquired about the actions of the Ministry of War.

775
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,590
Therefore they set an ambush.

776
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,390
The Northern Zhou's spies have been hiding in the Xiao for many years.

777
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,990
I've told you this is a big trouble.

778
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,470
You should have investigated it thoroughly that day.

779
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,030
The spies can’t be cleaned up.

780
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,470
Your Majesty, I have another thing to report.

781
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,300
Go ahead.

782
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,150
Last night,

783
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,030
the envoy from Northern Zhou sent a message that

784
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,350
their emperor's birthday is coming.

785
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,470
They hope the princess

786
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,510
can celebrate his birthday on time.

787
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,750
They asked the princess to leave as scheduled.

788
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,870
You may leave.

789
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,750
I shall take my leave.

790
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,950
I shall take my leave.

791
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,110
All of you.

792
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,590
In the history of the Xiao,

793
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,630
every dynasty inspires awe throughout the world.

794
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,870
But now,

795
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,430
our country is subject to other countries.

796
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,230
I

797
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,270
am a sinner.

798
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,140
Your Highness.

799
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,270
You came back alone?

800
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,510
Yes

801
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,310
Then

802
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,390
when will I leave?

803
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,470
As promised.

804
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,510
Two days later.

805
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,110
Two days?
