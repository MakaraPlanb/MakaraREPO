4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,270
I don't believe in ghosts,

5
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,750
But

6
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,470
the shelf suddenly

7
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,229
fell down that night,

8
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,020
which really scared me.

9
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,350
Not only you.

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,590
Wang Sheng reported to me later.

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,950
Even I was scared.

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,390
At that time, I thought

13
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,110
I should bring you back right away.

14
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,229
You can't do that.

15
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,350
Brother,

16
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,750
since I was young,

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,910
I was born in the palace.

18
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,620
I think I can know the world after reading thousands of books.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,990
But after I left the palace this time, I found that

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,510
there were things you can't read in this book.

21
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,780
For example,

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,100
I never thought

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,510
there were poor children like Tongtong in Lin'an.

24
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,630
I never thought

25
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,910
there were devoted women like Liu Yiyun.

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,190
I never thought

27
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,710
there were shameless men

28
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,230
like Mr. Liao!

29
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,990
Although there are similar stories

30
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,500
in the folk novels,

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,110
it's not as good as

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,430
what I saw with my own eyes.

33
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,990
So you still want to go back to the Wood Feather House?

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,590
Of course.

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,910
Please allow me.

36
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,870
Is it because you don’t want to leave Li Qingfeng?

37
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,110
No.

38
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,150
How could I miss him?

39
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,270
Brother, don't you use the reason

40
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,710
to stop me from leaving?

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,830
We're just friends.

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,470
Friend?

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,140
Just friends.

44
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,390
Who gave this to you?

45
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,550
Ur... Let me show you this.

46
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,150
Isn't it fun?

47
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,030
It is made by me in the Wood Feather House.

48
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,070
Isn't it exquisite?

49
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,230
You are so smart.

50
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,710
The delegation of the Northern Zhou arrived in Lin'an yesterday.

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,750
What does the delegation have to do with me?

52
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,870
You are the first princess of the Xiao Dynasty

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,270
When the delegation is here,

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,829
you should show our strength

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,310
and uphold our prestige.

56
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,990
Don't go back to the Wood Feather House

57
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,829
until the Northern Zhou delegation leaves.

63

OK?

65
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,630
And

66
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,550
there are a lot of work in the Wood Feather House

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,070
waiting for me to finish it.

68

72

You can go back.

74
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,030
But I have something to remind you.

75
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,150
You were born in the royal family.

76
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,310
As the first princess,

77
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,990
don't be too capricious.

78
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,940
You can make friends

with Li Qingfeng,

80
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,659

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,190
you forgot your gift.

193
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,190
Oh, yes.

194
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,350
You left in a hurry.

195
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,630
I almost forgot.

196
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Take care.

197
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,990
Architect Chen. Wait.

198
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,270
You can wait for me until we're back.

199
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,990
Master wants to see you.

200
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,350
Young master.

201
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,670
Master and Madam have been waiting for you for a long time.

202
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,710
I know.

203
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,110
Well,

204
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,190
should we go in first?

205
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,340
Let's wait.

206
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,470
But...

207
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,110
I told you to wait.

208
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,110
Yes.

209
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,870
Be gorgeous

210
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,830
and steady.

211
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,550
Brother,

212
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,590
I really have something important.

213
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,260
Nonsense!

214
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,270
Is there anything more important than my business?

215
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,860
You promised me

216
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,270
you can go back to the palace when I call you,

217
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,870
but you didn't say that you would look like this after returning to the palace.

218
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,670
I think you are getting more and more unreasonable.

219
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,500
You’d better stay in the palace

220
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,510
and learn embroidery from aunts.

221
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,830
Don't leave the palace anymore.

222
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,190
OK.

223
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,110
I know I am wrong.

224
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,870
Li Song, what time is it?

225
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,310
Your Majesty, we can move now.

226
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,990
Let's go. Let's meet the the 13th Prince.

227
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,270
Summon the Northern Zhou delegation.

228
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,990
The 13th Prince Yelv Zhigu

229
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,630
Han Tinghui, the Minister of Internal Affairs,

230
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,550
Xiao Xiazhi, the Minister of Rites, please come in.

231
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,550
Yelv Zhigu,

232
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,350
Han Tinghui,

233
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,110
Xiao Xiazhi.

234
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,750
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

235
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,420
Wish you longevity, Your Majesty!

236
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,190
The three of you come from afar,

237
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,230
you must be tired.

238
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,950
Have a seat.

239
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,190
Give the first seat to the 13th Prince.

240
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,910
Mr. Han. Mr. Xiao. Have a seat.

241
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

242
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,470
Today is a private banquet.

243
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,990
Don't be restrained.

244
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,590
I've long heard that

245
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,630
the 13th Prince is the most proud son of the emperor.

246
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,430
It is proved that you are really amazing

247
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,820
among the young princes of Northern Zhou.

248
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,990
I'm afraid no one can compare with you.

249
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,790
I’m flattered, Your Majesty.

250
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,470
Many princes of Zhou have their own strengths.

251
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,870
Some of them look handsome,

252
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,950
others are strong as a tiger.

253
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,670
When I compare with them,

254
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,540
I am only be considered mediocre.

255
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,070
You're too humble.

256
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,620
As far as I know,

257
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,630
the candidate for the new king of Northern Zhou

258
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,710
is you.

259
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,350
You must be kidding.

260
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,350
Father is still strong.

261
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,310
Now he has fought everywhere with ambition.

262
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,870
It's also the time of the prosperity of our country.

263
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,430
We just hope

264
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,470
to realize the dream

265
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,470
of unifying the whole country.

266
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,830
I wouldn't dare to say anything about the new king.

267
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,470
Not bad.

268
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,750
Emperor Zhou can be the king after fighting everywhere.

269
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,150
Since he acceded the throne,

270
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,870
he maintain the rule of turning every man into a soldier.

271
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,190
He led the strong army

272
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,430
and he was invincible all the way,

273
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,190
which is indeed admirable.

274
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,870
But because of that,

275
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,790
the burden of internal affairs

276
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,430
will be fallen on your shoulders.

277
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,950
I still need to ask Your Majesty about

278
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,830
the way of internal affairs.

279
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,390
We two countries can communicate each other

280
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,140
to gain experience.

281
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,110
Let alone asking me.

282
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,790
Summon the Dance and Music House.

283
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,670
The 13th Prince,

284
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,870
do you like

285
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,110
my banquet?

286
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,670
Your Majesty is treating us with hospitality.

287
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,430
I’m flattered.

288
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,230
No matter how good the banquet is,

289
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,670
it is not as good as the people of the Xiao Dynasty,

290
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,990
who can enjoy simple meal in the peaceful country.

291
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,910
The 13th Prince.

292
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,230
It's time for us to talk about business.

293
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,350
Langyue, you can leave now.

294
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,790
Yes.

295
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,470
Wait.

296
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,990
Your Majesty, I have a presumptuous request.

297
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,310
Your Majesty, please allow me.

298
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,150
Tell me.

299
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,630
I came from the Northern Zhou.

300
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,070
I haven't had a good visit in the capital Lin'an.

301
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,150
I just heard that today is the Zhongyuan Festival of the Xiao Dynasty.

302
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,510
May I invite Princess Zhaohe

303
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,030
to enjoy Zhongyuan Night together?

304
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,270
Fine.

305
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,420
Then let Langyue

306
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,710
show you around Lin'an

307
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,070
to appreciate local conditions and customs.

308
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,700
Your Majesty.

309
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,350
The 13th Prince came from afar.

310
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,590
You have to do your best.

311
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,990
Yes.

312
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,579
Thank you, Princess Zhaohe.

313
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,750
How about we drink?

314
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,470
Qingfeng.

315
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,069
Didn't you go home?

316
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,430
Why are you back so soon?

317
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,550
Where is Chen Langyue?

318
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,140
Architect Chen is not in the yard.

319
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,630
Not?

320
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,180
What's wrong with him?

321
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,990
I think it must be related to Master.

322
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,750
Miss. Zhao, why don't you ask him?

323
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,870
No way.

324
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,310
How about you go, Miss. Han?

325
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,750
I?

326
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,110
I...

327
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,990
No, no, no.

328
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,950
How could I ask?

329
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,910
Where is Li Qingfeng?

330
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,340
He...

331
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,910
He...

332
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,070
Luo,

333
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,510
I...

334
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,620
What happened?

335
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,500
I don't know.

336
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,830
Did they quarrel?

337
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,070
I don't think so.

338
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,790
Qingfeng.

339
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,110
Why?

340
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,110
I'm really sorry.

341
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,270
I didn't mean to break my promise.

342
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,430
If you don't want to go, just tell me.

343
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,110
Why did you lie to me like this?

344
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,870
I didn't lie to you.

345
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,070
Are you trying to make fun of me?

346
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,310
Do you know that everyone in the Li family,

347
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,030
dozens of people,

348
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,350
are laughing at me.

349
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,110
It's not what you think.

350
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,260
Then what is it?

351
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,510
Tell me.

352
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,430
Where did you go? Why didn't you go to Li's?

353
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,270
I had something to do at home. They called me back.

354
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,230
Didn't you say you're going to Li's?

355
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,830
Or it's not important for you

356
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,020
to go home with me?

357
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,900
No.

358
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,540
Chen Langyue, I've made it clear to you.

359
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,790
If you have any difficulties,

360
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,310
you can tell me any concerns.

361
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,470
I can do anything

362
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,550
to face it with you.

363
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,310
But you still don't want to be honest.

364
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,950
You don't trust me.

365
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,220
Why?

366
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,430
I...

367
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,150
You still don't want to tell me?

368
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,940
What else are you hiding from me?

369
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,030
No.

370
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,630
It's not what you think.

371
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,110
I'll give you another chance.

372
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,270
Explain it to me now,

373
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,550
or never tell me that.

374
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,500
Can you promise

375
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,030
don't mad at me anymore

376
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,630
after that?

377
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,310
You can say it first.

378
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,550
I have a distant friend at home.

379
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,430
If you lie,

380
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,310
you can make up a good story.

381
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,670
I didn't lie.

382
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,150
You have a friend at home

383
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,030
who only stayed in Lin'an for four hours.

384
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,670
Why can't you go to Li mansion first

385
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,670
and then go with me

386
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,670
to meet your distant friend?

387
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,430
Even if you went home,

388
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,750
why can’t you let Luo

389
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,670
to inform me?

390
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,870
Li Qingfeng!

391
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,550
He must have offended Master again.

392
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,430
Did anything happen?

393
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,110
I don't think so.

394
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,270
What happened?

395
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,950
Excuse me.

396
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,180
Excuse me. Excuse me.

397
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,150
Not necessarily.

398
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,670
What do you mean?

399
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,990
I want to know

400
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,900
whether Miss. Chen and Mr. Li had a quarrel?

401
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,310
Buddy, are you curious about this?

402
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,990
It seems that no matter who it is,

403
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,500
people all like to hear gossip.

404
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,750
Alright, I should go to the next one.

405
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,310
See you tonight.

406
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,110
See you tonight.

407
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,110
Take care, Miss Zhao.

408
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,030
It's boring. I'm going to drink too.

409
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,030
I'm going to see my lady.

410
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,790
You haven't answered me yet.

411
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,310
Let's continue.

412
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,310
Go! Go! Go!

413
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,030
Let's go.

414
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,870
My lady, are you all right?

415

417
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,510
What's wrong?

418
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,020
Mr. Li.

419
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,270
You can't make her angry like this.

420
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,790
She has her reasons.

421
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,430
Please understand.

422
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,790
If she doesn't trust me,

423
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,110
how can I understand her?

424
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,750
My Lady.

425
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,750
Mr. Li just doesn't know what's going on.

426
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,230
Calm down.

427
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,110
Calm down.

428
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,990
Explain it to him.

429
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,790
Don't let him misunderstand you.

430
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,270
Let him misunderstand me!

431
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,470
He questioned me without asking why.

432
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,270
Our love in the past are all fake!

433
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,550
Alright, calm down.

434
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,990
Do you know your mistake?

435
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,630
Well,

436
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,980
Someone is looking for you outside.

[Wood Feather House]

438
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,030
Are you Li Qingfeng?

439
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,630
Yes. Do you know me?

440
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,270
I'm the servant of Architect Chen.

441
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,150
My Young Master

442
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,030
wants to invite you to the mansion.

[Chen's Mansion]

444
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,030
Watch the steps.

445
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,150
This way, please.

446
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,470
This is my Young Master.

447
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,550
Mr. Li, go over there.

448
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,030
I’m Li Qingfeng.

449
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,430
Greetings to you, young master.

450
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,710
I heard you had a fight with Langyue.

451
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,430
Don't look at me like that.

452
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,550
As her elder brother,

453
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,230
I have to control

454
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,300
every move she does.

455
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,110
Young Master, just say it.

456
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,750
That's great.

457
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,950
I'm just curious about your attitude to Langyue.

458
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,310
You can tell me.

459
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,870
I love her and will love her forever.

460
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,390
Forever?

461
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,670
I will marry her.

462
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,750
Did you ask me?

463
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,270
I haven't visited you yet,

464
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,870
and I was invited here.

465
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,740
Did Langyue tell you about her family background?

466
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,630
Do you know

467
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,270
why she didn’t tell you her family background?

468
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,390
Because I've already arranged a marriage for her.

469
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,710
Sugar-coated haws.

470
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,460
Come and have a look!

471
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,230
Qingfeng, go and have a look.

472
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,060
Let's go.

473
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,030
Master is not here. Why are you still shopping?

474
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,830
Wang Sheng went away again.

475
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,910
Otherwise, I'll ask him to drink together.

476
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,630
It's better than walking around here.

477
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,390
Li Qingfeng.

478
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,150
How did you make my Master angry?

479
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,190
I told you, she made me angry.

480
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,830
How dare you?

481
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,310
Calm down, you two.

482
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,710
I believe Miss Chen

483
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,910
must not be the sensitive lady.

484
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,950
Since Luo said she was busy,

485
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,310
it means she had something to do.

486
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,590
What happened to Master?

487
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,750
If anything happens to her, it will be a big deal.

488
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,950
How could she leave Luo alone to spend the Zhongyuan Night?

489
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,500
What is it?

490
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,870
It's just that she's already engaged.

491
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,270
She said she has a distant friend.

492
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,390
No way.

493
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,350
Don't talk nonsense.

494
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,740
How could Master have a marriage?

495
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,150
If she has a marriage,

496
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,260
I can't be busy with all the matters

497
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,270
for the long time.

498
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,630
So she hid it from you too?

499
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,830
Qingfeng,

500
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,070
I think there must be some misunderstandings.

501
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,870
You can ask Miss Chen later.

502
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,910
Her brother told me

503
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,990

504
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,350
Brother?

505
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,630
You met her brother?

506
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,470
Yes.

507
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,510

515
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,150

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,990
The costumes and vocal

525
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,790
should be the same as Mulian Saves her Mother.

526
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,110
It should be a poetic drama from the central place.

527
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,270
It's rare in Jiangnan area,

528
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,830
so it's normal that you don't know.

529
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,670

It seems that it's always like this.

Miss Chen seems to mean something.

535
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,350

There are poem club on the boat,

There are many lanterns by the lake as well as many mosquitoes.

Don't miss it.

566
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,950
Yes.

567
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,750
I also think Kongming Lanterns are more interesting.

568
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,790
Since we have different opinions,

569
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,950
how about we travel separately?

570
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,940
Otherwise, someone will be unhappy.

571
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,380
What do you think?

572
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,790
That makes sense.

573
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,750
I've been in Lin'an for so long,

574
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,630
but I haven't had a trip to lake.

575
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,350
If possible,

576
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,990
I want to see

577
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,030
the beautiful lake tonight.

578
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,350
Anyone else?

579
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,390
Don't you want to go?

580
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,910
Miss Han.

581
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,950
It seems that what happened tonight is destined.

582
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,670
Niaoniao, let's go.

583
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,150
OK. It doesn't matter.

584
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,150
OK, let's go.

585
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,270
Let me tell you.

586
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,830
The moon will be very round later.

587
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,910
Li Qingfeng, what about you?

588
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,870
Where do you want to go?

589
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,230
I just want to take a walk.

590
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,070
Then I’ll leave Luo to you, Mr. Meng.

591
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,860
We should learn to help others.

592
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,470
Bye.

593
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,510
Why are there only the two of us?

594
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,310
I just want to take a walk.

595
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,510
Miss. Zhao, please yourself.

596
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,590
There's nothing to go shopping alone.

597
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,510
If you don't mind, let's go together.

598
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,830
There's nothing to mind.

599
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,030
Let's go together.

600
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,190
Don't get me wrong.

601
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,910
I don't want to go with you.

602
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,790
It's just that we're the only ones left.

603
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,510
Actually,

604
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,230
I've prepared a surprise for you and Miss Chen.

605
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,430
I want to tell you two tonight.

606
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,110
Unexpectedly, Miss Chen is not here.

607
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,270
Surprise?

608
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,870
I got a job for the Wood Feather House.

609
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,420
You will like it.

610
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,230
Work?

611
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,590
This job is different.

612
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,430
It's easy and meaningful.

613
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,670
After the Zhongyuan Festival,

614
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,910
I'll tell you the details.

615
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,750
Here. Slow down.

616
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,870
Boatman, take a boat.

617
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,900
OK. Choose one.

618
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,150
Is the price of the boat the same?

619
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,430
It's the same. Choose whatever you want.

620
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,910
This one. It is bigger.

621
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,270
Sure. Please.

622
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,070
Come on.

623
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,620
Give me your hand.

624
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,230
Come on.

625
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,310
Be careful.

626
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,590
That. That!

627
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,310
Ladies, welcome to come again after eating.

628
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,260
Fortunately, we don't miss the time to set the lanterns.

629
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,750
What is this?

630
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,230
Sir, this looks delicious.

631
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,030
Lady,

632
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,270
this is called Crispy Yellow Dough.

633
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,270
Isn't this a yam?

634
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,350
Sir, I want one.

635
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,350
OK.

636
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,150
Thank you.

637
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,140
Lady, take it.

638
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,870
Thank you, sir.

639
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,430
You're welcome.

640
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,470
Is it good?

641
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,350
Delicious.

642
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,910
This lantern is so beautiful.

643
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,670
The material is delicate and the painting is good.

644
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,470
As a painting on the lantern,

645
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,700
it's rare to have this artistic one.

646
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,590
It is because they choose the right lantern paper.

647
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,230
What do you mean?

648
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,710
The thickness of the lantern paper is suitable,

649
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,230
so the green light can come through the lantern.

650
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,150
The light and the painting can set each other

651
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,630
to create the atmosphere.

652
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,190
I see.

653
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,910
Sir, how much is this lantern?

654
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,150
Lantern riddles must be guessed right

655
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,590
before you can buy it.

656
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,710
If you can guess the riddle on the lantern in the first time,

657
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,110
you can buy it with the original price, 300 coins.

658
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,430
If you guess it twice, the price will double.

659
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,870
If you get the answer three times, the price will double again.

660
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,310
After that, you can guess any riddle

661
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,630
and the price won't rise again.

662
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,070
If the riddle can't be guessed, the price will double.

663
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,350
This method is interesting.

664
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,910
Let's guess this one.

665
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,470
OK.

666
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,350
Ninety nine.

667
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,150
This riddle is too short.

668
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,230
How can we guess?

669
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,750
Ninety nine. Not one hundred.

670
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,030
It is character Bai.

671
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,030
Yes!

672
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,990
Sir, is it Bai?

673
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,150
You are so smart.

674
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,430
Congratulations. You got the answer right.

675
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,470
This lantern is made by Bai Laoer at Tianqiao Shop.

676
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,950
I'll sell it to you with 300 coins.

677
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,870
I'll buy it.

678
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:07,950
OK.

679
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,550
Miss Zhao, if you like it,

680
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,140
I'll give it to you.

681
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,990
That's great.

682
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,510
Wait.

683
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,670
This lantern is so beautiful.

684
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,700
Sir, I want this lantern.

685
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,030
This is the 19th poem tonight.

686
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,430
The one who guesses three poems successively

687
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,350
[It was the Zhongyuan Festival when I came to the world, which is not like Xuandu where people are free forever.]

688
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,350
[Burning incense lonely in the temple, I know my teacher has long been yearning for Yujing Mountain far away.]

689
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,150
will be able to enter the poetry boat

690
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,550
to drink and write poems with all the scholars and talents.

691
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,190
Everyone, please.

692
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,380
[It was the Zhongyuan Festival when I came to the world, which is not like Xuandu where people are free forever.]

693
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,380
[Burning incense lonely in the temple, I know my teacher has long been yearning for Yujing Mountain far away.]

694
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,590
It was the Zhongyuan Festival when I came to the world,

695
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,310
which is not like Xuandu where people are free forever.

696
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,110
Burning incense lonely in the temple,

697
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,150
I know my teacher has long been yearning for Yujing Mountain far away.

698
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,790
It's a good poem.

699
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,710
Are they asking us to guess the poem name?

700
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,790
Yes.

701
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,630
As long as we say the poem name and the author,

702
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,460
they'll show next poem.

703
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,070
The one who guesses three poems successively

704
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,830
can get on the boat of Jiangnan Poetry House

705
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,990
to attend the poem club.

706
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,830
I see.

707
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,310
Do you know the author

708
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,350
of the poem?

709
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,590
I happen to know this poem.

710
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,980
It's "To Master Zhang on Zhongyuan Festival",

711
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,470
which author is a scholar named Linghu Chu.

712
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,830
Then you can answer!

713
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,870
I remember.

714
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,670
This poem is "To Master Zhang on Zhongyuan Festival".

715
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,390
The author is Linghu Chu.

716
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,590
Congratulations!

717
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,350
We were too slow.

718
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,630
We were a little slow.

719
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,830
That's the way of preemptive answer.

720
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,230
But it doesn't matter.

721
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,380
Anyway, we're just wandering.

722
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,790
It doesn't matter if we get on the boat or not,

723
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,980
or do you want to get on the boat?

724
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,470
I can't even guess poems,

725
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,670
let alone write poems.

726
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,110
I thought you wanted to get on the boat.

727
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,230
You know each other?

728
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,110
Is this your distant friend?

729
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,950
Yes, this is my friend from afar.

730
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,470
What do you think?

731
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,710
It's also the secret

732
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,110
you can't tell me?

733
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,910
You talk nonsense.

734
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,310
You are out of all reason.

735
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,580
Miss Zhao, let's go.

736
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,830
Give me the lantern.

737
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,630
OK. Wait.

738
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,180
Sir, we want this lantern.

739
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,500
Lady,

740
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,260
I just said...

741
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,350
I know.

742
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,590
You said we should guess riddles.

743
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,150
He can guess it, so can we.

744
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,270
So the reason you recite poems

745
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,790
is to have more discussions

746
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,990
in business.

747
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,990
Yes.

748
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,430
The poem and lyrics are used to cultivate emotions,

749
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,470
but I use it as a business talk.

750
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,150
Isn't it funny?

751
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,110
I just don't understand.

752
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,950
Not just poems,

753
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,870
I learned and understood other aspects

754
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,230
as long as they can help my business,

755
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,030
such as popular opera,

756
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,150
the taste of food,

757
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,620
and even brothel.

758
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,940
I know it better than anyone else.

759
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,550
Just for business?

760
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,670
That's right. That's my dream.

761
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,470
Dreams?

762
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,270
I know the position of businessmen is low,

763
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,350
but I still want to be a businessman.

764
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,390
I believe in business rules.

765
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,710
In some perspective, these business rules

766
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,390
are my life credibility.

767
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,270
Only in business,

768
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,030
I can find

769
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,270
my own way to survive

770
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,110
and my value.

771
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,750
Value?

772
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,830
It is indispensability.

773
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,350
According to my opinion,

774
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,590
in our life,

775
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,310
we need the  indispensability.

776
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,389
Miss Han.

777
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,219
I want to ask you a silly question.

778
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,150
Go ahead.

779
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,909
Would you like businessmen?

780
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,630
I hate businessmen.

781
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,750
Sorry.

782
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,070
I don't mean I hate you.

783
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,949
Don't get me wrong.

784
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,750
Mr. Luo. Are you alright?

785
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,909
If I offend you...

786
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,989
No, it's OK.

787
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,949
But I think

788
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,070
you are different from ordinary businessmen.

789
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,710
Can the businessman like me

790
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,750
like you?

791
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,870
Luo.

792
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,390
Have you decided what wish you want to make?

793
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,270
I hope my lady...

794
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,830
No.

795
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,150
I hope the princess

796
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,310
can be healthy and safe every day.

797
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,870
I also hope she can be happy every day

798
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,470
and finally realize her dream.

799
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,230
What about you?

800
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
I...

801
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,670
Except Master,

802
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,190
you have to make a wish for yourself.

803
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,390
I have no wish.

804
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,110
I just hope

805
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,790
to serve the princess all the time.

806
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,070
You have to get married.

807
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,270
You should make a wish for yourself

808
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,390
to find a good husband.

809
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,550
I don't want to get married.

810
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,390
After you meet your lover someday,

811
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,390
you will not think like that.

812
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,190
Trust me.

813
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,670
It begins!

814
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,270
Hurry!

815
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,350
I'll count to three. Let's do it together.

816
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,670
One, two, three.

817
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,350
Let it go.

818
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,110
Make you wish quickly!

819
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,270
I hope in the future,

820
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,750
I can as happy as tonight every day.

821
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,070
By the way,

822
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,990
I hope Luo

823
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,190
find her lover as soon as possible.

824
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,390
Mr. Meng.

825
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,390
What wish did you make just now?

826
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,590
I just said it.

827
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,190
What?

828
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,870
Didn't you hear me?

829
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,230
Are you serious?

830
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,430
I'm serious.

831
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,870
Besides what you just said,

832
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,550
nothing else?

833
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,550
No.

834
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,310
What else?

835
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,110
What about the princess?

836
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,110
Master?

837
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,030
I really forgot Master.

838
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,390
Forgot?

839
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,110
Was it because I was mad at she and Li Qingfeng?

840
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,350
They had a fight,

841
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,390
but I'm not angry anymore.

842
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,630
I must think she is a princess.

843
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,510
I can’t imagine what wish I can make for her.

844
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,390
I see.

845
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,620
By the way, Luo,

846
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,590
does Master have a marriage?

847
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,870
What are you talking about?

848
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,030
How is that possible?

849
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,670
Yes, I told him it's impossible.

850
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,830
Li Qingfeng is insane.

851
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,670
Let's not talk about this.

852
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,750
Come, I'll take you to eat something delicious.

853
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,190
According to the rules,

854
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,270
you must guess the riddle on the lantern

855
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,310
to qualify as the competitor of them.

856
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,990
It's not difficult. Come on.

857
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,710
Miss Chen.

858
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,670
Let me do it.

859
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,750
I'm new here.

860
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,230
I really want to experience it.

861
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,790
Please grant me my wish.

862
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,630
OK. You must win the competition.

863
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,660
I will try my best.

864
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,590
Miss Chen.

865
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,230
Mr. Li and I

866
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,070
were abandoned by those two pairs.

867
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,190
Don't get me wrong.

868
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,780
Miss Zhao, don't worry.

869
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,070
Of course I won't think too much.

870
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,870
Today I just want to be against Li Qingfeng. He has weird temper.

871
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,350
It's not hard to guess the answer.

872
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,150
Well, I'll make another riddle with the riddle.

873
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,870
It will become more difficult.

874
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,310
Sir?

875
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,230
Please.

876
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,270
Ninety nine. What's the another riddle?

877
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,870
One in hundred.

878
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,790
The answer of ninety nie is Chinese character "Bai",

879
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,030
and that of one in hundred is also "Bai".

880
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,390
He can get the answer quickly.

881
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,830
It's amazing.

882
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,390
You are really talented.

883
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,060
Then this competition is fair.

884
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,350
Please.

885
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,070
I’m He Zhigu.

886
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,790
May I know your name?

887
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,780
You don't need to know.

888
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,070
In the Rat Year, spring is coming.

889
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,870
The spring breeze returns home.

890
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,670
It's about to start. It's interesting.

891
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,790
A decent man doesn't meet the emperor.

892
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,710
Sorry, Mr. Li.

893
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,430
A decent man doesn't meet the emperor?

894
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,870
The answer is also Li.

895
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,180
Answer the riddle with a riddle. It is amazing.

896
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,550
Miss Chen.

897
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,350
Shouldn't you be happy?

898
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,390
Yes.

899
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,510
Good job, Mr. He.

900
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,750
Three or five roads outside the border.

901
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,910
The answer is an idiom.

902
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,230
Three or five roads outside the border?

903
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,870
Three or five roads

904
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,390
What?

905
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,390
Mr. He, can’t you guess?

906
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,190
The answer is

907
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,580
nonsense.

908
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,350
He is really mean.

909
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,390
Miss Chen, why are you laughing?

910
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,590
Mr. Li, it's my turn.

911
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,670
Listen carefully.

912
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,870
When writing, it is square.

913
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,310
When drawing, it's round.

914
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,230
It is short in winter.

915
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,910
It is long in summer.

916
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,870
The answer is a character.

917
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,430
I got it.

918
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,790
The answer is... Mr. Li.

919
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,270
Actually,

920
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,270
Getting the answer when guess riddles

921
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,870
is not difficult.

922
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,710
What do you mean?

923
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,070
When we count one to ten,

924
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,070
you should make another riddle with the same answer

925
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,550
and match both sound and sense with my riddle.

926
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,790
Then you'll win.

927
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,430
If you can't, you'll lose

928
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,910
and I'll buy this lantern for Miss Chen.

929
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,430
Do you dare?

930
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,710
Within ten numbers, the riddle should be matched with another.

931
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,390
How is that possible?

932
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,390
Oh no!

933
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,830
OK.

934
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,230
OK.

935
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,230
Miss Chen, tell me.

936
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,390
What is the answer?

937
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,390
Character Ri.

938
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,870
Ri?

939
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,710
How can we make the riddle?

940
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,230
He is going to lose.

941
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,430
Ten.

942
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,060
Li Qingfeng.

943
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,270
Let's not gamble with him.

944
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,750
Eight.

945
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,310
Give him the lantern.

946
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,990
Seven, six, five.

947
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,430
No.

948
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,390
Four, three, two, one.

949
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,430
What do you mean, Mr. Li?

950
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,830
You can't guess?

951
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,870
Or are you wasting time on purpose?

952
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,350
There's a fish in the East Sea.

953
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,390
It has no head or tail.

954
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,350
Take out its spine.

955
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,990
It is the answer.

956
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,780
The answer is character Ri.

957
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,630
Ri?

958
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,830
I lost.

959
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,620
I admire you.

960
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,590
Thank you.

961
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,870
I announce

962
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,750
the winner of this riddle competition is Mr. Li.

963
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,750
Mr. Li.

964
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,390
This lantern is yours.

965
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,030
Miss Chen.

966
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,060
Your friend is really literary.

967
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,510
I can only give this lantern to him.

968
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,550
Forget it.

969
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,030
It's just riddle guessing.

970
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,590
He is still a fool.

971
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,590
Can you tell me now

972
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,590
who he is?

973
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,430
You are good at guessing, so you can guess again.

974
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,270
You are unreasonable.

975
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,790
# 赵小姐

976
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,830
Let's go.

977
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,390
Mr. Li.

978
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,830
You must be curious about my identity.

979
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,710
How about this?

980
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,390
I'll make another riddle.

981
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,070
If you can guess it,

982
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,860
you will know who I am.

983
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,550
My riddle is

984
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,990
one pen

985
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,550
can write two people

986
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,270
and three ears.
