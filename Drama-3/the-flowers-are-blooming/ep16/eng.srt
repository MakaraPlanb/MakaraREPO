00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,990
Please cancel the marriage as soon as possible.

192
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,870
The agreement between the two states is not a joke.

193
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,310
You haven't asked me if I want it.

194
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,220
Isn't this a joke?

195
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,910
Your marriage is a national affair.

196
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,830
Why can't I make the decision?

197
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,950
But I love

198
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,870
Li Qingfeng.

199
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,750
Li Qingfeng?

200
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,390
I told you that

201
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,310
you two can be friends, but you can only be friends.

202
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,100
Brother, why?

203
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,710
Langyue.

204
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,070
It's my fault to hide this from you.

205
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,230
But I have my own thoughts.

206
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,830
You are my favorite sister,

207
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,310
but you're also Princess Zhaohe of the Xiao.

208
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,820
Now,

209
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,110
your marriage has become a national affair.

210
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,870
Not only you have no choice,

211
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,310
even I

212
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,390
have no choice.

213
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,270
Why?

214
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,220
You can't understand the crisis of the state.

215
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,670
In the past two years,

216
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,350
the Northern Zhou has invaded the border of our state for many times.

217
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,260
-But we... -I don't care about that.

218
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,150
You don't care about that.

219
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,310
But I’m serious.

220
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,830
This matter has been settled.

221
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,710
I see.

222
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,910
It turns out that you have planned everything.

223
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,710
You made up your mind when you asked Madam to teach me

224
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,230
needlework and rites.

225
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,350
No wonder you asked me

226
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,350
to take Yelv Zhigu to hang around Lin'an.

227
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,550
No wonder you told Li Qingfeng

228
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,150
that I have an engagement.

229
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,310
It turns out that you did all this

230
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,750
on purpose.

231
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,910
It's useless to talk more.

232
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,030
Go back to the palace as soon as possible.

233
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,510
Don't leave the palace anymore.

234
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,350
Fatuous Emperor.

235
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,630
I am the emperor.

236
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,070
How dare you say that?

237
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,950
The princess has returned to the Wood Feather House.

238
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,870
She doesn't want to stay any longer.

239
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,020
Since the marriage has been put on the agenda,

240
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,510
should I take her back to the palace?

241
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,950
You keep protecting her.

242
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,070
You'll take her back

243
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,350
when I need her.

244
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,350
This is the last freedom

245
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,390
I can give to Langyue.

246
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,380
Yes.

247
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,520
[Wood Feather Pavilion]

248
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,150
Since you came back,

249
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,350
you have something on your mind.

250
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,430
That obvious?

251
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,670
It's written on your face.

252
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,110
I don't want to force you,

253
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,830
but I still hope you can tell me.

254
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,790
No matter what happens,

255
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,710
I'm willing to face it with you,

256
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,990
even if it takes my life.

257
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,430
Do you understand?

258
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,510
-I... -Qingfeng,

259
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,600
[Wood Feather Pavilion]

260
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,190
I officially inform both of you that

261
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,950
Wood Feather House has another big deal.

262
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,630
Everyone,

263
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,710
this is a great opportunity for the House

264
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,630
to earn great repute in Lin'an.

265
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,710
It’s raining heavily, but we still need to work.

266
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,550
Did the water destroy a bridge?

267
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,590
You are correct.

268
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,670
I was just kidding.

269
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,150
Exactly.

270
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,950
There is a wooden bridge outside Jin'nan County.

271
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:46,830
Over the years,

272
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,870
people in Zhang's village and Xu's village can use it.

273
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,630
The two villages communicated with the outside through this bridge,

274
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,350
and got along well.

275
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,190
But recently,

276
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,150
the bridge was destroyed by heavy rains.

277
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,270
So residents in the two villages decided to repair this bridge together.

278
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,940
Just to renovate a broken bridge for two remote villages?

279
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,790
Does it have anything to do with being famous in Lin'an?

280
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,869
There's something you don't know.

281
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,670
The two villages

282
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,069
were supposed to split the bill 50-50.

283
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,589
But Xu's villagers thought

284
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,150
they only have half of the people of Zhang's village.

285
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,470
They only want to pay 33% of the total cost.

286
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,790
In desperation,

287
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,220
this matter came to the government office in Jin'nan County,

288
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,390
then to the Ministry of Works.

289
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,950
The Ministry of Works can do nothing about it.

290
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,790
Because this bridge is a civil building,

291
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,030
so they can't use public funds.

292
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,550
Recently, the heavy rain

293
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,510
has destroyed the houses in many places.

294
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,190
The Ministry of Works doesn't even have enough people.

295
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,830
Under desperation,

296
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,670
they had to hire a folk team,

297
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,790
which means the Wood Feather House has undertaken this job.

298
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,870
Didn't you say the Ministry of Works has no money?

299
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,950
Yes.

300
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,150
So you mean

301
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,950
we will have to work for free

302
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,150
and clean up a mess.

303
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,470
This is why it is the best time for our House

304
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,110
to be famous in Lin'an.

305
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,030
We have to be famous before we can make profits.

306
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,630
We just need to make Xu's village

307
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,950
to pay the half of the money,

308
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,430
and then we repair the bridge.

309
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,950
It will be a great favor to the Ministry of Works.

310
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,550
If the Ministry of Works has any work in the future,

311
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,230
they will definitely choose the Wood Feather House.

312
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,950
With the support of the Ministry of Works,

313
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,030
our Wood Feather House will be famous in Lin'an.

314
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,670
In this case,

315
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,910
this is a good opportunity.

316
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,260
We can go and have a look.

317
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,990
Wait.

318
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,510
Am I the only one that found the problem?

319
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,980
Xu's village refused to pay.

320
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,270
They first came to the county government,

321
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,070
and then to the Ministry of Works.

322
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,630
It hasn't been solved yet.

323
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,630
It's easier said than done, Luo Ye.

324
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,710
Can that empty talk

325
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,750
you made

326
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,510
make them willing to pay for the other half?

327
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,740
Since Luo Yao said it,

328
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,870
it means he's confident.

329
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,590
You trust your brother a lot, huh?

330
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,350
Well, Mr. Luo,

331
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,950
may I ask, what is your plan?

332
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,670
Take measures according to the actual situation.

333
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,620
If you can really solve this,

334
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,990
I'll be convinced by you.

335
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,190
To be honest,

336
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,190
I have made a promise with the Ministry of Works.

337
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,990
Anyway,

338
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,630
we must do it well.

339
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,950
It will take some time

340
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,950
to go to Jin'nan County.

341
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,740
Well,

342
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,870
girls, pack your bags first.

343
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,790
I will report to Miss Zhao.

344
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,790
Qingfeng,

345
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,550
go pack the tools now.

346
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,390
OK.

347
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,790
Officer,

348
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,990
you and Wang Sheng go find a few carriages.

349
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,430
We’ll leave immediately

350
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,310
when the rain lets up.

351
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,310
Don't bring too thick clothes.

352
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,510
No way.

353
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,190
Even the rain lets up in Lin'an,

354
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,710
it may not stop raining in the county.

355
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,710
It's a long journey and it's cold in the carriage.

356
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,990
What if you get cold?

357
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,150
We won't sleep in the carriage.

358
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,310
No way.

359
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,310
In the middle of nowhere,

360
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,910
if you catch a cold,

361
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,550
I'll be guilty.

362
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,750
My lady, do you want to bring the moon?

363
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,990
Take it.

364
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,470
What if you can't sleep without the moon

365
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,870
after we arrive?

366
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,710
Stop joking.

367
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,990
I’m so worried now.

368
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,670
I hardly know

369
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,390
how to tell Li Qingfeng who I am.

370
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,870
Now His Majesty wants me to get married and move to the Northern Zhou.

371
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,110
I have no idea how to tell him.

372
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,630
What would Architect Li do

373
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,390
if you tell him the truth directly?

374
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,270
I can't imagine.

375
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,750
I think

376
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,710
you should beg His Majesty.

377
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,790
Don't say that to me again.

378
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,710
If I say one more word to His Majesty,

379
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,710
I'm afraid I'll be locked up

380
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,030
and tied up to send to the Northern Zhou.

381
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,630
How could His Majesty...

382
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,150
How could he bear to let you leave?

383
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,990
Unfortunately, His Majesty has made up his mind.

384
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,300
Luo,

385
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,310
I have no choice.

386
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,310
If that's the case,

387
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,950
why didn't His Majesty ask Lord Wang

388
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,390
to take you back to the palace?

389
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,550
I don't know.

390
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,750
I just have a hunch

391
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,510
that the situation will get worse.

392
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,790
Forget it.

393
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,230
Don’t think about these troubles.

394
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,950
Just

395
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,870
let it be.

396
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,310
That's what it is.

398
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,910
This is a good time for us

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,710
to be famous again.

400
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,190
I'm afraid it's not as simple as I thought.

401
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,030
The harder it is,

402
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,390
the more it can show the outstanding points of our Wood Feather House.

403
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,300
Boss,

404
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,470
do you want to go with us?

405
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,100
I won't go.

406
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,310
Boss,

407
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,310
you haven't been to Wood Feather House for a long time.

408
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,230
Do you want me to gather everyone before you leave

409
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,270
to listen to your instructions?

410
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,310
Don't be so glib with me.

411
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,710
I'm fine.

412
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,030
I'm not going to the Wood Feather House

413
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,790
because I have other things to do.

414
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,310
It's good that you're fine.

415
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,710
If anything happens to me,

416
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,670
I won't withdraw the investment of Wood Feather House.

417
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,110
I've invested in a lot of businesses these years.

418
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,190
Only a glib businessman like you

419
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,270
does the job well.

420
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,030
Thank you for your compliment.

421
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,420
If there's nothing else, I'll go back.

422
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,470
Boss,

423
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,230
are you really not going to see everyone off?

424
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,710
Forget it.

425
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,790
It makes me look distant.

426
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,990
Let's go back to the Wood Feather House.

427
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,020
Miss Zhao, please.

Everyone,

429
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,710
as for these three carriages

430
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,390
except the first carriage Wang Sheng drove,

[Wood Feather Pavilion]

432
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,630
you can arrange the rest.

433
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,950
Li Qingfeng, wait.

434
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,270
I have something to tell you.

435
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,790
Miss Chen, please come with us.

436
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,390
Is she here to make trouble again?

437
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,630
No.

438
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,030
Just now in the meeting hall,

439
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,190
Miss Zhao wished us

440
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,790
to complete this job successfully.

441
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,700
Since Miss Zhao doesn't go to Jin'nan with us,

442
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,270
she must have let it go.

443
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,870
Architects.

444
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,430
First of all, I want to congratulate you.

445
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,070
After these days, I've figured it out.

446
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,630
You two are the best people

447
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,110
to match each other.

448
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,750
A few days ago, I had a fantasy.

449
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,630
But then I thought about it, I shouldn’t have.

450
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,990
I, Zhao Yining, am not a troublemaker.

451
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,270
So the second thing

452
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,870
is to ask you to forgive me for being restrained in the past.

453
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,870
Miss Zhao, you overstated.

454
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,950
Miss Chen, just say you forgive me.

455
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,020
Okay.

456
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,950
So the third thing

457
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,710
is to bring me something novel or delicious

458
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,310
in Jin'nan,

459
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,790
if you find any.

460
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,790
Is that too much to ask?

461
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,070
OK, I promise you.

462
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,390
You finally promised me one thing.

463
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,230
There's nothing left to say.

467
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,270
can you give me a friendly hug?

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,470
Miss Zhao, thank you.

469

I want to take a carriage with Master.

What do you mean?

490
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,470
Mr. Luo means

491
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,830
it would be tiring on the way.

492
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,470
You should take a carriage with Luo.

Don't worry.

496
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,150
Architect Chen has her own carriage.

497
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,430
OK.

498
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,670
Let's go.

500
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,990
If I took a carriage with you,

501
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,150
would Mr. Luo hate me?

502
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,950
You overstated.

503
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,590
Can't you see that, Niaoniao?

504
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,710
If we separate Qingfeng and Architect Chen,

505
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,390
we will be the worst sinners in the world.

506
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,550
Let Mr. Luo arrange it.

507
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,390

I’ve been observing you for days, but you haven’t made any moves.

514
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,230

515

No.

You don't need to worry about Master.

Since when did you trust Architect Li so much?

530
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,740
That’s because I can’t do anything.

00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,820
What can I do now?

♫You are my unexpected scenery♫

562
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,260
♫It's the first time I feel my heart flip♫

563
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,400
♫Not knowing why♫

564
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,230
It.

565
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,180
♫Just let it pass by♫

566
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,430
Did you hear that?

567
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,150
It.

568
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,010
♫The moon has seen my hair get lifted by the wind♫

569
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,710
Am I talking about saying "it"?

570
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,630
Li Qingfeng,

571

00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,660
Mr. Luo, what kind of calculations are you doing?

578
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,510
Niaoniao.

579
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,670
I really care about my money.

580
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,790
What’s wrong?

581
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,590
Qingfeng and I

582
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,110
can take one carriage together.

583
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,110
But now there are two more carriages.

584
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,740
It costs a lot of money!

585
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,430
They are right.

586
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,230
You are the reincarnation of the calculator.

587
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,070
I'm making money for marrying you.

588
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,070
If you want to wash my clothes,

589
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,030
you'll have plenty of chances after we arrive in Jin'nan.

590
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,750
You wish.

591
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,070
You look like you bite your tongue.

592
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,070
Do you have something to tell me?

593
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,390
Actually,

594
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,110
I should tell you.

595
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,510
But

596
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,220
I don't know how to say it.

597
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,110
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.

598
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,620
I can wait patiently.

599
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,020
Before,

600
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,150
you kept chasing me around and asking me.

601
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,910
Why? Are you not anxious now?

602
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,150
Do you want me to keep asking you?

603
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,710
Forget it. Forget it.

604
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,310
I won't ask if you don't want to tell me.

605
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,030
Isn't this the trust you want?

606
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,790
Yes.

607
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,830
But...

608
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,870
Don't say "but".

609
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,270
I can stop asking.

610
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,230
But after coming back from Jin'nan,

611
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,350
you must go home with me.

612
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,790
Go to your home?

613
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,430
My father has been waiting.

614
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,910
If

615
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,950
we can come back together,

616
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,910
I'll go.

617
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,070
Really?

618
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,990
Yes.

619
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,420
OK. Take a look.

620
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,550
Lay your cards. Lay your cards.

621
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,670
I...

622
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,470
I won.

623
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,670
Luo, you won many rounds.

624
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,750
Of course.

625
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,670
Sir,

626
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,070
you taught me this.

627
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,590
Triple  with single.

628
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,060
You learned so fast.

629
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,220
It's windy.

630
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,910
I'll go get some thick clothes for my lady.

631
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,670

632
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,790
I don't think it's necessary. Forget it.

633
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,990

00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,220
not to solve the case for you.

749
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,070
How about this?

750
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,990
Take us to the scene.

751
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,710
If this work is not complicated,

752
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,070
it won't cost much.

753
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,830
You don't have to fight like this.

754
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,870
Am I right?

755
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,110
No matter what,

756
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,790
they offer 66% of it.

757
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,390
I'll give 33%.

758
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,300
Listen.

759
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

760
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,380
Who are you scolding?

761
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,630
You have no conscience.

762
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,390
We were so nice to you.

763
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,710
We gave you the rice every year.

764
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,630
You have any shame at all?

765
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,870
We exchanged the rice with fish.

766
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,270
It's natural to exchange things with things.

767
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,630
Don't talk like we owe you.

768
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,070
OK.

769
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,630
From this year on,

770
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,590
just eat fish every day.

771
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,670
You won't be able to

772
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,380
eat a single fish from Zhang's village.

773
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,140
I won't eat fish.

774
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,070
I won't.

775
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,870
Fine.

776
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,660
Alright.

777
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,590
Why are you quarreling again?

778
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,390
Can you take us to the scene?

779
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,870
Just go.

780
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,550
I'm not afraid.

781
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,830
Let's go.

782
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:18,780
Let's go.

783
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,150
Lord, please.

784
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,270
I'm going too?

785
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,350
You are the county magistrate.

786
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,750
Who else will go if you don't go?

787
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,590
Please.

788
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,740
[Impartiality and integrity]

789
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:35,870
Everyone,

790
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,830
I think

791
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,390
you'll have to stay in Jin'nan County for a while.

792
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,310
I've prepared the room.

793
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,630
Thank you, Lord Zhou.

794
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,830
Niaoniao, Luo.

795
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,030
You don’t need to go.

796
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,270
Set up the luggage and tools in the car.

797
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:47,870
OK.

798
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,550
My lady,

799
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,070
is it dangerous for you to go?

800
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,020
Don’t worry.

801
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,590
They are ordinary villagers,

802
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,310
not bandits.

803
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,150
Yes, Luo.

804
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,110
Li is here.

805
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,630
She won’t be in danger.

806
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,990
Let's go to the scene first.

807
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,020
My lady, be careful.

808
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,550
It's okay.

809
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,350
They are fighting.

810
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,710
Charge!

811
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,150
Xu's village must be making trouble.

812
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,630
We don’t cause trouble,

813
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,510
but we are not afraid of trouble.

814
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,590
I'm not afraid of you either.

815
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,540
Stop fighting!

816
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,510
It’s really lively.

817
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,150
This is not a good time to stand by.

818
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,310
If someone gets hurt,

819
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,390
the conflicts between the two villages can't be reconciled.

820
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,830
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

821
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,870
Master, don't come over.

822
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,390
Stop fighting!

823
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,670
Alright.

824
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,710
I'll protect you. Let's go.

825
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,390
Guys, stop fighting!

826
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,310
Stop fighting!

827
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,390
Stop fighting!

828
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,270
Stop fighting!

829
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,030
Stop fighting!

830
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,030
Stop fighting!

831
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,350
Stop fighting!

832
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,510
Stop!

833
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,060
That's what I'm saying.

834
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,820
Can it solve the problem?

835
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,790
What should we do?

836
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,710
Yes, what should we do?

837
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,100
What should we do?

838
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,750
Everyone, calm down.

839
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,500
Qingfeng, you and Architect Chen go to have a look

840
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,750
to check the amount of work.

841
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,830
Let's go.

842
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,670
Everyone, calm down. Don't fight.

843
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,150
Let's check the amount of work.

844
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,070
The bridge deck is completely broken.

845
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,390
Only the bridge abutment is left.

846
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,550
But the deck and the abutment are a whole.

847
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,950
Even if we build

848
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,070
a strong deck,

849
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,670
the standing pier,

850
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,390
will not be as persistent as before, I'm afraid.

851
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,070
It will collapse from heavy rain.

852
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,430
I think the underwater foundation of the bridge deck

853
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,670
is basically destroyed by the water.

854
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,020
I'm afraid we need to build a new bridge.

855
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,750
Build a new wooden bridge?

856
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,110
The work amount is huge.

857
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,310
Not a wooden bridge, but a stone bridge.

858
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,270
A stone bridge?

859
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,260
Yes, look at this river.

860
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,790
The upstream is the confluence of two tributaries.

861
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,230
The water flows are not small even in sunny days.

862
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,190
Even if we build

863
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,190
a strong bridge deck,

864
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,830
the part under the water will still be washed out by water.

865
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,990
It's still dangerous.

866
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,350
So for safety,

867
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,070
we need to build a stone bridge,

868
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,550
a stone arch bridge.

869
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,230
Let's go.

870
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,870
We can't make it clear.

871
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,870
We have to check the amount of work before we can solve the problem.

872
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,670
Qingfeng, how's the work?

873
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,430
I need to build a new stone arch bridge.

874
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,670
This is really a big project.

875
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,270
Sir,

876
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,150
you're here to build the bridge for us.

877
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,700
We all agree.

878
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,790
We all rely on the bridge to live by.

879
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,430
It's natural to spend money on repairing the bridge.

880
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,630
But if they want us to pay half of the money,

881
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,190
we will never agree.

882
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,030
Yes, never.

883
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:40,910
Look.

884
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,510
They are so unreasonable.

885
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,870
I don't want to talk to you.

886
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,230
I don't want to talk to you either.

887
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,550
Sir,

888
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,630
if you have a solution,

889
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,230
the whole village will thank you.

890
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,900
If you can't work it out,

891
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,870
you can go back to where you come from.

892
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,430
We won't repair this bridge.

893
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,430
Yes, we won't repair it.

894
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,380
Yeah.

895
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,670
Yeah.

896
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,510
You just said you all relied on this bridge,

897
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,830
but you won't repair it now in a blink of an eye.

898
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,420
You change so fast.

899
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,230
What's wrong with that?

900
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,510
What's wrong with that?

901
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,190
Stop arguing.

902
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,790
Stop arguing.

903
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,750
Stop arguing.

904
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,270
Stop arguing!

905
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,070
Stop arguing!

906
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,870
Stop arguing.

907
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,990
Everyone, listen to me.

908
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,870
Calm down.

909
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,790
Give us some time.

910
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,550
We will find a solution.

911
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,750
Sir,

912
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,350
since you promised that you have a solution,

913
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,550
I trust you.

914
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,510
Tell us, how many days do you need?

915
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,660
Three days.

916
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,670
Just three days. How about that?
