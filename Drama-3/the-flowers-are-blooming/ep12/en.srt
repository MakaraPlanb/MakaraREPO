193
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,590
Line up.

194
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,790
Come on.

195
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,950
Two for each. No more.

196
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,810
[San Fu Orphanage]

197
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,950
Miss Zhao,

198
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,630
why didn't you tell us you would come?

199
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,190
I want to stand here.

200
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,910
Director Xu, Qi Cai.

201
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,830
How are you?

202
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,710
We're good.

203
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,470
We're good.

204
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,230
It's my turn.

205
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,190
Miss Zhao, what are you...

206
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,030
Qi Cai, take it for me.

207
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,550
Thank you, Sis Zhao.

208
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,830
You want toys?

209
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,510
Yes!

210
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,670
OK.

211
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,350
I want this one.

212
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,510
Everyone,

213
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,830
the real competition is to start.

214
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,710
Kids,

215
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,150
there are some toys on the table.

216
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,700
You're gonna pick one of them later.

217
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,950
If you see the toy you like,

218
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,430
line up in front of it.

219
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,070
Got it?

220
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,590
Yes!

221
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,910
All right.

222
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,830
Let's get started.

223
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,430
Come on.

224
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,070
Look at this.

225
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,230
Do you like this?

226
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,350
You can sit on it!

227
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,830
Thanks!

228
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,910
This is for you.

229
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,390
What do you think? Check it out.

230
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,790
Take it.

231
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,190
This is awesome!

232
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,950
The handle is here. Here.

233
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,710
All right?

234
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,510
Do you like this?

235
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,900
Put your hands here.

236
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,510
Gently move forward and back.

237
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,030
How is it?

238
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,270
Not bad, huh? There you go.

239
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,070
You can do this.

240
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,110
Look.

241
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,990
Do you like this toy?

242
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,670
Yes.

243
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,030
Come here. Have a try.

244
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,510
So cute!

245
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,270
Alright.

246
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,390
Have you made your choice?

247
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,710
If you do, line up in front of your favorite toy.

248
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,030
Come on. Line up.

249
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,700
Three votes for my Loving-seeking Phoenix.

250
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,670
See?

251
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,670
Three kids chose my work.

252
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,550
On behalf of the kids,

253
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,950
I want to express my gratitude, Miss Zhao.

254
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,270
Thank you all.

255
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,070
You're welcome, Director Xu.

256
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,710
They're like my siblings.

257
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,190
I feel obliged

258
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,550
to help them.

259
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,670
Director Xu, don't worry.

260
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,670
You're so nice, Miss Zhao.

261
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,710
Have a seat, Director Xu.

262
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,230
Please have a seat.

263
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,070
You can have a seat, too.

264
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,630
Sit down, please.

265
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,190
Director Xu.

266
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,110
You look very concerned.

267
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,790
What's wrong?

268
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,430
I'm afraid you can't help this time.

269
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,270
Dad, let me tell her what happens.

270
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,790
A private orphanage like ours

271
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,390
survives thanks to our donors.

272
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,670
from good-hearted people.

273
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,670
But in recent years, we have more and more abandoned babies,

274
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,910
which results in greater pressure to raise all of them.

275
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,220
In their dorms,

276
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,470
there are only beds now.

277
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,990
We don't have more space.

278
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,590
But still,

279
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,750
the number of bed is not enough.

280
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,350
Qi Cai.

281
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,230
How many orphanages

282
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,790
are there in Lin'an?

283
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,150
So far,

284
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,230
there are nine in total.

285
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,670
As far as I know,

286
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,230
you and your daughter

287
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,750
work without even getting paid.

288
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,270
You run the orphanage voluntarily.

289
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,470
You're their parents,

290
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,670
nursing workers and teachers.

291
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,390
Right?

292
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,510
Yes, Mr. Li.

293
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,860
I never regret it.

294
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,110
Because this is my calling,

295
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,950
and I must do it.

296
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,870
My daughter is helping me here.

297
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,110
Besides,

298
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,390
we also have three other volunteers.

299
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,670
But volunteers are hard to find these days.

300
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,830
Our orphanage fares better

301
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,710
compared with other orphanages. They don't even have any volunteer.

302
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,150
And the kids they have are just as many as here.

303
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,310
In other words,

304
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,590
even if you have money to build a new orphanage,

305
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,310
you may not be able to recruit volunteers.

306
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,590
Exactly.

307
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,910
If I remember correctly,

308
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,190
the Ministry of Revenue has opened many governmental orphanages.

309
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,230
Director Xu,

310
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,950
what's the difference between private and governmental orphanages?

311
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,870
Lin'an is home to the biggest number of governmental orphanages.

312
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,110
There are 11 now.

313
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,270
Our orphanage is a private one established

314
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,350
following the example by the government.

315
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,950
Then it's strange.

316
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,630
People are living in peace and prosperity,

317
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,070
and Lin'an is the capital city.

318
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,030
More orphanages, both public and private ones, are opened.

319
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,110
But why are there an increasing number of abandoned babies?

320
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,180
Everyone knows

321
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,710
Lin'an has the greatest number of orphanages,

322
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,950
and the best supporting policies.

323
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,470
That's why there are a lot of abandoned babies from those who live near Lin'an.

324
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,790
I see.

325
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,590
I'll ask my father

326
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,990
to look into it,

327
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,350
and ask him to report to His Majesty.

328
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,110
It's very kind of you.

329
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
But the local government

330
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,710
has already known our situation.

331
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,100
And they need to fix the problem step by step.

332
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:14,980
At present,

333
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,550
the most urgent issue here

334
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,700
is our kids' accommodation.

335
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,510
Director Xu, I'm an architect.

336
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,830
If you don't mind,

337
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,270
would you show me their dorm?

338
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,630
Come in, everyone.

339
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,150
Please.

340
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,710
Please come in.

341
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,310
Look.

342
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,470
There are many kids who live in this small room.

343
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,100
Only beds are put here.

344
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,740
Where do you put their clothes and other supplies?

345
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,470
Some are put in the firewood warehouse.

346
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,590
Some, in the stable.

347
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,390
This is really tricky.

348
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,630
Li Qingfeng, are you sure you can fix it?

349
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,590
Meng Yuanxu!

350
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,780
Mr. Li.

351
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,470
Do you have any idea?

352
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,070
The beds are all crowded here.

353
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,270
I'm thinking about

354
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,110
a different way to arrange them to leave a bigger space.

355
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,590
This is how big the room is.

356
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,020
How can you have a bigger space?

357
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,430
Maybe we should build new dorms

358
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,030
in the yard.

359
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,630
New dorms...

360
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,310
What?

361
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
What did you just say?

362
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,630
This is how big the room is.

363
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,670
I have an idea.

364
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,670
Really?

365
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,750
Director Xu, Qi Cai.

366
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,910
I need

367
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,339
all the construction information of the orphanage,

368
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,630
especially of these four dorms,

369
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,150
as well as the kids' height, weight

370
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,990
and ages.

371
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,350
Give all of the above to me.

372
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,270
All right?

373
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,110
No problem. When do you need it?

374
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,750
When will you start the work?

375
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,070
You know our situation.

376
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,390
We...

377
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,790
Director Xu, you don't have to tell us.

378
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,940
I know what you're gonna say.

379
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,990
We'll do it for free.

380
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,790
We won't charge a penny.

381
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,750
Yes.

382
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,790
Don't worry about that.

383
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,820
They are all weird people,

384
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,510
but they are kind.

385
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,910
On behalf of our orphanage

386
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,150
and all our kids, thank you.

387
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,260
Don't! Don't!

388
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,210
[Wood Feather House]

389
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,580
Bunk beds?

390
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,310
Yes.

391
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,950
We'll use bund beds to replace the old beds.

392
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,470
For kids who sleep on the upper deck,

393
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,750
they can climb via the connected ladder.

394
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,630
So we can save half of the space.

395
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,270
Interesting.

396
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,590
But after the kids on the upper deck fall asleep,

397
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,750
what if they turn over and fall?

398
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,870
There will be railings around the beds

399
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,150
with tenon and mortise on.

400
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,110
In this way, when kids are sleeping,

401
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,310
there is no risk of falling down.

402
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,510
This switch can also be opened

403
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,870
so they can go up and down the ladder.

404
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,230
Wonderful!

405
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,390
In this case, the biggest problem

406
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,710
will be solved.

407
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,750
Great!

408
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,270
The best part is that

409
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,590
this is applicable to all the private orphanages

410
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,190
as well as

411
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,350
governmental ones.

412
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,740
Right.

413
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,110
This will benefit the whole state and the people.

414
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,510
Qingfeng, we can start working now.

415
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,190
Wait, no rush.

416
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,270
Since we want to renovate the orphanage,

417
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,510
we must do it in a comprehensive way.

418
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,750
Other than the dorms,

419
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,150
we need to think about

420
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,750
what else they need

421
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,670
and what they don't have for the moment.

422
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,870
Let's make the renovation plan applicable to all the orphanages.

423
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,230
I know it.

424
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,590
When I was

425
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,870
a kid,

426
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,350
my father worked in Customs Administration

427
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,270
and he was in charge of seaborne trade.

428
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,070
Once,

429
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,470
he brought back a local drawing book from Liuli State.

430
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,110
I remember there were

431
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,190
many recreation facilities for kids in that book.

432
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,390
One was a slide.

433
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,350
I always hoped that my dad would Slide?

434
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,350
make one for me.

435
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,470
But I still haven't got one.

436
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,270
Speaking of which,

437
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,670
that's one of my childhood regrets.

438
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,510
Slide?

439
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,870
What does it look like?

440
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,430
Let me draw it for you.

441
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,230
That's pretty much how it looks.

442
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,230
This...

443
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,950
Mr. Meng,

444
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,470
I think you should learn how to draw properly.

445
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,870
Not how to draw pantings,

446
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,510
but how to draw lines.

447
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,620
That doesn't matter.

448
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,150
I'll go home and get the book for you.

449
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,830
Then hurry up.

450
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,950
I really want to see it.

451
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,950
Master, how about I make a slide for you?

452
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,070
Among us, Luo is more like a kid.

453
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,070
You should make one for her.

454
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,460
Then I'll make two.

455
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,270
If you have no further questions,

456
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,350
I’ll tell you what to do next.

457
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,350
OK.

458
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,430
Li Qingfeng.

459
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,380
Give some work to me, too.

460
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,590
Thanks to you, we've got this work to do.

461
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,750
So I don't really have any work for you right now.

462
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,990
Fine.

463
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,110
Miss Zhao.

464
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,710
Don’t drive me away.

465
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,750
I want to ask you

466
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,830
what happened between you and Miss Chen.

467
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,950
Nothing.

468
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,430
We just had a little fight.

469
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,190
Thank you for asking, Miss Zhao.

470
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,340
So you two are still in a relationship.

471
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:14,910
Right?

472
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,070
I...

473
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
Then I won't disturb you two.

474
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,580
Goodbye.

475
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,750
Miss Zhao,

476
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,350
Wood Feather has taken on this good deed

477
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,860
all thanks to you.

478
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,100
I'm professional.

479
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,950
Since I'm the deputy architect here,

480
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,060
I'll do my job.

481
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,510
Professional?

482
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,270
Good.

483
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,830
The one who throws it the fastest will win!

484
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,590
Quiet, please.

485
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,470
Mr. Wang, please.

486
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,270
Kids,

487
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,670
let me introduce him.

488
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
This is Mr. Wang.

489
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,350
He made

490
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,670
the weapon that can transform itself.

491
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,750
Do you like it?

492
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,870
Yes!

493
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,390
So now,

494
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,630
Mr. Wang has a question for you.

495
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,910
You must think carefully before you answer it.

496
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,510
OK?

497
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,270
OK!

498
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,590
Please.

499
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,230
Sword?

500
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,990
He has a sword!

501
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,230
Great!

502
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,470
Does any of you

503
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,870
want to kill?

504
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,390
Do you have

505
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,630
someone you want to protect?

506
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,630
Yes!

507
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,600
[orphanage bunk bed Li Qingfeng]

508
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,870
The two sides of the slide don't have to be of the same height.

509
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,430
When kids go down the slide, they lean outward.

510
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,390
So it's safer inside,

511
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,110
and it can be shorter inside.

512
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,270
Okay.

513
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,710
Besides work,

514
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,910
you don't want to talk to me about anything else?

515
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,590
You should be the one to talk about that.

516
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,190
Li Qingfeng.

517
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,470
I'm trying to make up with you.

518
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,630
But you're so mean!

519
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,470
I know it's my fault. And you just don't want to

520
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,390
forgive me, do you?

521
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,670
So you know it's your fault, huh?

522
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,630
You...

523
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,030
Master, Li Qingfeng.

524
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,230
I think you should teach your disciple

525
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,150
how to knock on the door.

526
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,990
OK, Li Qingfeng.

527
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,950
I'll be back later.

528
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,660
No outsiders are allowed here.

529
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,310
Who are you calling an outsider?

530
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,510
What are you here for?

531
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,310
Master, have you finished the drawing?

532
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,390
I tell you what.

533
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,270
When I went home to get the drawing book,

534
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,630
I heard something interesting.

535
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,670
To the north of Lin'an,

536
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,590
there is a village.

537
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,950
Somebody there made a wooden bull,

538
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,390
which is amazing.

539
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,510
It can plough lands like a real bull

540
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,790
and you don't have to feed it.

541
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,060
Isn't that incredible?

542
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,630
How many people does the wooden bull need to operate it?

543
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,270
How do I know?

544
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,830
So I want to invite you

545
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,910
to go with me

546
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,550
and check it out.

547
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,990
If we can learn how to make it

548
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,590
and introduce it to the whole state,

549
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,670
the lives of farmers will be much easier.

550
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,950
Where did you hear that?

551
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,190
It sounds crazy.

552
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,750
Maybe it's true.

553
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,140
See?

554
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,030
Architect Li, since you're free now.

555
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,830
Why don't we go out to have a look?

556
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,390
Okay, I'll go.

557
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,270
Fine.

558
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,990
Luo is free, right?

559
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,470
Let's take her with us.

560
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,390
Okay, I'll call her.

561
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,190
Listen.

562
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,550
Mr. Meng is going to play a hero this time.

563
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,470
Wait for my order and go out together.

564
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,430
Make it work!

565
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,990
Don't worry. I'm a professional!

566
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,110
I'll help you get the girl!

567
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,710
Where are you? Why don't you talk?

568
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,590
I'm getting ready.

569
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,830
I need some time.

570
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,060
OK. Get ready then.

571
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:20,990
What?

572
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,990
You're a bandit too?

573
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,190
What are you talking about?

574
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,870
Get down!

575
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,150
I'm in charge of this area.

576
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,910
Do you know the rules?

577
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,790
Who are you? In charge of what?

578
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,630
I...

579
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,710
You're a rookie!

580
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,830
You're new, right?

581
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,750
Who...Who are you?

582
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,150
I'll teach you the rules today.

583
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,190
Tie them up.

584
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,510
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

585
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,870
Call me master when you meet me again.

586
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,910
Take them away!

587
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,220
It's been more than two hours.

588
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,510
Why haven't we arrived yet?

589
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,190
We're almost there. Master, we're almost there.

590
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,110
Master, watch out!

591
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,110
It's my territory here!

592
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,550
If you want to pass by, pay me!

593
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,310
I, Official Meng, pray every year

594
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,430
for a chance to punish the evil and promote the good,

595
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,030
now I've got the opportunity!

596
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,990
But let me make it clear now.

597
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,270
When we fight,

598
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,310
don't hurt these two girls.

599
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,270
What are you talking about?

600
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,910
If you're an official, I'm the emperor.

601
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,910
How dare you!

602
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,910
What did you say?

603
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,750
Who do you think you are?

604
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,630
How dare you say that?

605
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,470
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

606
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,070
Master.

607
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,630
Don't negotiate with bandits!

608
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,630
You guys go now.

609
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,590
I will risk my life

610
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,710
to protect you!

611
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,430
I see.

612
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,030
Is that girl your lover?

613
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,550
That's great.

614
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,390
I'll get both your money and your girl today.

615
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:24,990
How dare you?

616
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,900
If you dare hurt her,

617
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,030
I'll kill you

618
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,540
even if it means I'll die myself!

619
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,550
Boss.

620
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,110
I prefer

621
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,990
the girl next to her.

622
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,260
So...

623
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,670
Who do you think you are?

624
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,750
If you touch her, I'll kill you!

625
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,670
Guys,

626
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,500
get the girls. Go!

627
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,310
Are you crazy?

628
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,950
Where's Xu?

629
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,710
I am Xu.

630
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,980
You're not!

631
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,030
I am!

632
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,430
Miss!

633
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,710
Where?

634
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,550
Right here.

635
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,150
Hurry up.

636
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,740
Right here.

637
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,750
Right here.

638
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,830
Where?

639
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,590
We...We're almost there.

640
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,750
Right here.

641
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,830
Yunrui! Mr. Meng!

642
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,670
Are you okay?

643
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,150
Wang Sheng was sent by your brother to protect you, right?

644
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,470
I don't know.

645
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,870
I'm crazy to expect you to be honest with me.

646
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,950
What do you mean by that?

647
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,110
Have you ever been sincere to me?

648
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,590
Chen Langyue.

649
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,350
I told you

650
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,150
when it's the right time,

651
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,950
I will explain everything to you.

652
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,990
The right time?

653
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,950
Tomorrow? Or next year?

654
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,950
Or when you marry that Mr. He?

655
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,150
Li Qingfeng.

656
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:37,940
They...

657
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,910
They're aruging.

658
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,030
I made it.

659
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,750
What?

660
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,510
Nothing.

661
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,350
Miss.

662
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:49,950
Let's go.

663
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,470
Langyue.

664
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,150
Miss.

665
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,390
Mr. Li, I...

666
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,830
Take me to see the wooden bull.

667
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,550
My friend already went there.

668
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,780
He said it's just a rumor.

669
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,190
It’s not true. Right?

670
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,230
Exactly. Exactly.

671
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,590
[Wood Feather House]

672
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,150
I upset you a lot.

673
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,310
But I don't know how to apologize properly.

674
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,830
So I use this to help me.

675
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,310
Miss, cry if you want.

676
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,120

677
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,390

685
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,870
I wonder

686
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,750
why Lord said that to Architect Li.

687
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,990
He just doesn’t like Li Qingfeng.

688
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,720
♫I'm lucky♫

689
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,830

Don't cry. Don't cry.

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,870
Don't cry. He's so mean.

696
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,710
Why do I have to explain myself?

697

♫I don't know what will happen♫

698

No offense,

707
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,910
♫Ask how you really feel♫

708
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,940
you wouldn't have been so tired.

Try to take it easy.

719
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,590
Maybe both of you need to cool off.

720
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,310
Who is it?

721
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,710
Master, it's me.

722
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,830
Let's talk tomorrow.

723
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,060
Master, it's my fault for what happened today.

724
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,470
Would you please open the door?

725
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,550
Alright.

726
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,270
Master.

727
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,190
You...

728
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,070
I'm fine.

729
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,830
Alright. Let's go out for a walk.

730
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,630
Master.

731
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,710
Master, sorry.

732
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,550
I know I'm stupid.

733
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,030
No, it's Xu Yunrui who's stupid.

734
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,790
No, it's me.

735
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,310
I wanted to

736
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,590
prove how much I cared about you, Master.

737
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,030
But I made a fool of myself.

738
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,830
It's fine.

739
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,150
I won't blame you for that.

740
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,870
And don't blame yourself.

741
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,590
How can I not blame myself?

742
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,230
Meng Yuanxu, I know you're good to me.

743
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,790
But we can’t force love.

744
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,910
Can we just do our own jobs

745
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,750
and see each other as friends?

746
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,790
Master, you're still blaming me.

747
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,990
I'm begging you.

748
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,230
Don't say that.

749
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,390
That's so demeaning.

750
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,990
Meng Yuanxu, I'm serious.

751
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,830
We can only be good friends.

752
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,910
Don't waste your time

753
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,830
on me.

754
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,030
Since it's a craftsmen team we're having in Wood Feather,

755
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,630
we must be professional and do our jobs.

756
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,630
Do you understand?

757
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,630
Yes.

758
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,790
We can have fun together.

759
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,310
We can make a scene together.

760
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,670
We can work together.

761
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,230
But don't come up with any strange ideas

762
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,630
to stress me again.

763
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,230
I'm tired.

764
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,430
Did I make you tired?

765
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,830
If you can do as I say,

766
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,909
we'll be the best friends.

767
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,310
But if you don't,

768
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,710
I'll have to stop hanging out with you.

769
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,510
We need to draw the drafting of the orphanage today.

770
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,139
Sir.

771
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,950
Luo.

772
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,150
What?

773
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,910
I come here when I’m free

774
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,270
and read books on architecture.

775
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,390
What are you doing here?

776
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,070
Six Warriors down Kunlun Mountain

777
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,230
I think it's more of Six Warriors in Wonderland.

778
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,190
Stop making fun of me.

779
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,670
Are you worrying about something?

780
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,230
What are you worried about?

781
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,190
Last night, Master said

782
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,870
she hoped

783
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,230
I would stop wasting my time on her.

784
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,670
She asked me to be her friend only.

785
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,350
That's good.

786
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,670
But I've been

787
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,190
having a crush on her for all these years.

788
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,630
How can I just let go so easily?

789
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,470
That's right.

790
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,470
But are you in a hurry to get married?

791
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:53,870
I...

792
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,070
Not really.

793
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,790
All right.

794
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,430
Then it's okay for you to be good friends for now, right?

795
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,390
What else can I do about it?

796
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,270
Speaking of which,

797
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,590
this bracelet

798
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,950
should be returned to my mother.

799
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,470
No. If I gave it back to her,

800
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,700
she would think

801
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,710
we broke up

802
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,270
and try to bring us together.

803
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,470
That would bring more problems.

804
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,230
When I was home the other day,

805
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,230
mother asked me

806
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,710
to take you back.

807
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,710
Sir.

808
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,190
Please...don't say that.

809
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,710
Forget it.

810
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,470
This is so annoying.

811
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,630
I won't return the bracelet then.

812
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,430
I'd better sleep.

813
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,470
Raise your hand. Here.

814
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:48,590
Go on.

815
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,470
Slow down.

816
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,710
You can't catch up with me.

817
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,630
One, two, three.

[San Fu Orphanage]

819
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,910
Here, lift it up.

820
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,630
I'm here.

821
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,750
You have practiced for too long.

822
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,750
And your shoulders are tight.

823
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,110
Take a break and practice with me later.

824
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,150
Yes sir!

825
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,420
Do you like martial arts?

826
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,910
You said if there was someone I want to protect,

827
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,940
I should practice martial arts.

828
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,310
Who do you want to protect?

829
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,230
Yingying.

830
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,790
I see.

831
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,620
Will I become an awesome fighter

832
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,940
just like you?

833
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,670
Maybe you will be

834
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,070
even better than me.

835
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,150
Really?

836
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,950
Yes.

837
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,260
So who do you

838
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,190
want to protect?

839
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,950
I...I want to protect my father.

840
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,150
But I don't know martial arts.

841
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,470
I can only stay by his side

842
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,110
and do my best to help him.

843
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,830
In that case, you've done a better job than me.

844
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,830
Be careful.

845
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,470
This way.

846
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,950
Be careful.

847
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,830
Watch your steps.

848
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,470
Just put it here.

849
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,790
Put it here.

850
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,190
Thanks, guys.

852
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,300
Miss Chen, come out and see the bed!

853
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,940
You already finished it?

854
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,310
I worked overtime.

855
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,460
Check it out. How is it?

856
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,350
Well done.

857
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,950
It's neat and cute.

858
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,430
Right?

859
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,940
The kids will like it.

860
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,670
Qingfeng, what do you think?

861
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,670
Good.

862
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,110
Let's make the beds according to this one.

863
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,070
OK.

864
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,150
Miss Han.

865
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,790
Is it done?

866
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,670
All done.

867
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,750
So,

868
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,110
we can start tomorrow.

869
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,670
By the way, where are they?

870
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,510
When I went out,

871
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,830
I saw Miss Zhao, Mr. Meng and Luo together.

872
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,790
I don't know where they were going. They looked secretive.

873
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,590
Master.

874
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,750
Meng Yuanxu. Mr. Meng.

875
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,470
Great. You're all here. Come with me.

876
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,310

877
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,300
Big news.

[Orphanage Donation]

879
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,830
In my opinion,

880
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,950
an excellent young businessman

881
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,950
must be full of wisdom

882
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,950
embrace challenges,

883
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,380
and be ambitious.

884
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,310
Why are you walking so fast?

885
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,190
Wait for me!

886
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,950

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,070

to fund orphanages in the long run

892
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,950
and support me.

893
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,150
Today,

894
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,950
the charity Chamber of Commerce is officially established.

895
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,150
I will be the chairwoman.

896

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,830
From now on,

898
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,950
we are partners in the Chamber of Commerce.

899
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,590
We will grow up together

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,950
Of course.

903
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,150
I can understand if you don't want to join.

904
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,670
A good deed comes from one's heart.

905
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,470
I won't force you to do good with me.

906
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,150
But I hope you can

907
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,710
think carefully about it.

908
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,660

911
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,380
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

912
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,950
Count me in.

913
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,390
This is what Miss Zhao

914
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,750
asked you and Luo to do?

915
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,590
Yes.

916
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,430
It's not easy

917
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,750
to gather all those busy people here.

918
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,430
Is this Miss Zhao's idea?

919
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,820
All right.

920
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,230
I knew you would join me.

921
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,750
Thank you for your trust.

922
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,510
Now you can ask Luo to register for you.

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,150
Bravo! Bravo!

924
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,550
I think we can make it.

One by one.

929
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,150
One by one.

930
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,230

933
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,390
Miss Zhao, you did a good deed today.

934
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,510
I really admire you.

935
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,590
Cut the crap.

936
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,310
Go to Luo to register as well.

937
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,190
You bet.

938
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,150
I will.

939
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,510
By the way, Miss Zhao,

940
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,470
why do you want to do this all of a sudden?

941
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,830
You’ve been busy with the renovation.

942
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,030
I was the only one who's free.

943
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,430
Then I came up with this idea.

944
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,510
I don't know if it'll really work.

945
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,310
But since I've tried my best,

946
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,790
I'll make it work.

947
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,060
It doesn't hurt to try, right?

948
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,430
Judging from their reaction,

949
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,020
I think you can make it.

950
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,230
What do you think?

951
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,590
If you can make it work,

952
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,230
it'll be a sustainable plan

953
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,910
and help more people in the future.

954
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,750
Well done. I'm so impressed.

955
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,990
You finally said something nice to me.

956
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,550
Next!
