How did the fire start?

11
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,670
Someone must have set it.

12
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,750
Because before the fire started,

13
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,270
our door had been locked from inside.

It was an accident.

If we tell Grandma about the accident, she will understand.

she will feel guiltier about it,

This is also

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,870
why Miss Chen asked Luo to stall grandma

No way.

41
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,750
We already took over his shop.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,750
How dare he do so?

43
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,630
It's exactly because I took over his shop

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,910
that he sought revenge.

45
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,470
Let's put it aside for now.

46
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,110
Just take it as an accident

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,430
so that the culprit will lower his guard.

Architect Li, what do we do now?

53

It's not as bad as we thought.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,150
Grandma's house wasn't valuable in itself.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,630
So it's easier to rebuild it according to the drafting,

56
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,030
especially the re-direction of the fire path.

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,510

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,550
You can insert it into the hair,

191
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
clip your hair with it

192
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,870
or comb your hair when you open it.

193
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,910
You're welcome.

194
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,230
I like hairpins.

195
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,750
I also like contraptions.

196
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,870
But a hairpin with contraptions...

197
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,110
You don't like it?

198

It's good.

199

Is this our house?

It looks completely different.

for the renovation.

I hope you'll live comfortably here.

Yes.

Great.

Don't touch me.

251

Don't go back. I can do it.

Slow down.

Nothing.

Have you noticed that someone is following us?

Yes.

267
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,990
Look at you. You have no clue.

You don't!

Alright, let's get down to business.

Who's that?

276
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,740
The one who set the fire.

277
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,150
I don't think he's the butcher.

278
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,230
Maybe he’s a spy sent by the butcher.

279
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,310
We haven't taken any action so far.

280
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,030
So he asked someone to keep an eye on us.

[Wood Feather House]

282
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,070
Now we have two options.

283
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,670
One is to follow that guy

284
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,070
and find out the truth.

285
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,550
The other is to do nothing.

286
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,590
When the butcher thinks he's safe,

287
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,390
he'll come out himself.

288
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,670
That butcher is so vicious.

289
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,190
I won't let him get away with it again.

Who?

It's me.

No one is following you, right?

295
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,910
Of course not.

How is it?

298
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,870
Everything looked normal.

299

They drank a lot after the construction

300
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,900
and went back to the Wood Feather House.

301
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,510
They didn't mention the fire at all.

302
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,190
They probably think it was just an accident.

Idiots.

304
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,070
In that case,

I don't have to hide here.

306
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,100
Two of them were in the house.

307
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,630
Weren't you afraid you would kill them when you set fire?

308
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,830
That's even better.

309
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,990

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,910
When did I do that?

378
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,140
Since the night of the fire,

379
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,190
the way you treat Li Qingfeng has changed.

380
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,540
If you have nothing else to say, go back to your room.

381
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,150
Sir.

382
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,550
Miss.

383
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,430
Go.

384
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,670
Miss Chen, you just dismissed him...

385
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,550
No worries.

386
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,510
He will be fine soon.

387
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,190
Since Grandma's house is done,

388
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,110
I should leave now.

389
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,030
What?

390
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,860
Are you leaving?

391
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,740
Miss Han.

392
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,910
You said you have work

393
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,230
for us to do, didn't you?

394
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,790
I thought about it later.

395
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,550
feeling it too complicated.

396
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,270
Architect Li, you would be too good for the job.

397
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,550
So I don't think you should waste your precious time

398
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,150
to do it.

399
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,190
I'm not afraid of complicated work.

400
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,550
It will help prove the strength and improve the reputation

401
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,470
of our Wood Feather House, right?

402
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,630
Qingfeng is right.

403
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,550
Anyway, forget it.

404
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
No, you can't leave.

405
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,470
That's right, Miss Han.

406
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,950
Let's not talk about the job.

407
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,950
Would you please consider

408
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,430
working as a supervisor in the Wood Feather House?

409
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,230
I'm really sorry.

410
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,790
See you then.

411
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,100
Miss Han!

412
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,550
Why?

413
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,910
It seems that

414
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,270
there's something she couldn't tell us.

415
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,590
Since you really want her to work here,

416
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,390
I shall go to bring her back now.

417
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,470
Go!

418
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,350
Her lady didn't mean to upset you.

419
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,660
Please don't take it personally.

420
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,870
Luo.

421
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,190
I need to go home.

422
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,470
Come with me.

423
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,630
Me?

424
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,550
For what?

425
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,950
Robbery.

426
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,390
Robbery?

427
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,430
Go home for robbery?

428
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,510
Right.

429
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,940
Aren't you afraid that

430
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,700
Lord Meng will punish you?

431
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,630
I won't rob him.

432
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,110
Then who are you going to rob?

433
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,190
My mother.

434
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,510
Rob Madam Meng?

435
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,030
You know what.

436
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,190
My mother has prepared a gift to her future daughter-in-law.

437
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,270
It's a bracelet.

438
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm going to take it

439
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,910
and give it to Master when the time is right.

440
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,790
Let's go.

441
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,910
Sir.

442
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,150
Why do you want to give her a token of love all of a sudden?

443
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,270
You silly girl.

444
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,270
Didn't you see how they talked to each other today?

445
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,990
If I don't take any action,

446
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,550
Master will be taken away

447
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,550
from me by that Li Qingfeng.

448
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,350
But Sir,

449
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,350
if you just

450
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,510
give her lady the bracelet so rashly,

451
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,230
she won't accept it.

452
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,790
I know.

453
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,020
That's why I said

454
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,710
I'll give it to her when the time is right.

455
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,790
Don't worry.

456
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,710
I know what to do.

457
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,510
OK.

458
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,670
Check it out.

459
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,380
Miss Han!

460
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,950
Miss Han!

461
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,950
Mr. Luo.

462
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,550
What are you doing here?

463
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,550
Miss Han, are you free now?

464
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,110
Let's go to the teahouse for a cup of tea

465
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,820
and have a chat.

466
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,550
Sir.

467
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,470
Do we really have to do this?

468
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,270
This is the make-or-break moment.

469
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,870
But we're gonna do it in broad daylight.

470
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,470
Isn't this too risky?

471
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,430
Don't worry.

472
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,630
I know my home very well.

473
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,630
There's a route that no one will take.

474
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,230
OK.

475
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,390
Come on.

476
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,870
Come on.

477
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,390
I have a plan.

478
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,430
The bracelet is in my mother's jewelry box.

479
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,070
Her room is right in the front. It's not far from here.

480
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,510
After going through three scenic walls, four hallways,

481
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,470
and two gardens, we'll arrive at her room.

482
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,340
I'll go in and get the bracelet.

483
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,150
And you stay outside and be on the watch.

484
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,990
This way. This way.

485
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,870
Me?

486
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,150
You...

487
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,070
What?

488
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,550
Sir.

489
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,830
I think we've already taken this route just now.

490
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,950
Uh, yeah.

491
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,190
I did it on purpose

492
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,910
so that no one will follow us this way.

493
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,070
One.

494
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,350
Two.

495
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:57,900
Three.

496
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,310
Four.

497
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,670
Five.

498
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,310
Are you here to steal something?

499
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,750
Luo, what day is it today?

500
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,270
May 15th.

501
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,310
What's wrong?

502
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,030
It's the day for the guards' training.

503
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,470
Answer me!

504
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,670
Run!

505
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,350
Go get them!

506
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,070
Come on! Stop!

507
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,710
This way! Stop!

508
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,470
Stop! Stop!

509
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,910
Go!

510
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,270
Hurry! Over there!

511
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,590
Stop! Stop!

512
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,390
Stop!

513
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,310
Hurry up!

514
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,470
Over there!

515
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,310
This way!

516
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,430
Sir.

517
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,590
Sir, how can we get out of here?

518
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,390
Luo, calm down.

519
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,510
Everything's going according to my plan.

520
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,190
This is my mother's room.

521
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,070
Guard at the door please.

522
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,190
I find it!

523
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,950
Thieves?

524
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,830
Yes.

525
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,990
They're one man and one woman.

526
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,510
Sir, your mother is back!

527
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,630
It's okay. Let's leave from the window.

528
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,510
Stop.

529
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,270
The footprints stop here.

530
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,430
Oh no! Someone came in here.

531
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,950
Madam.

532
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,470
Come in.

533
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,150
Madam.

534
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,670
The footprints of the two thieves

535
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,870
stop at your back window here.

536
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,270
If they did enter your room,

537
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,510
then I'm afraid they're still here.

538
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,780
How dare you!

539
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,590
You're trying to steal at Lord Meng's mansion!

540
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,310
What are you waiting for? Come out!

541
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,260
I'll count to three.

542
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,430
One.

543
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,780
Two.

544
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,670
Yuanxu?!

545
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,110
Young master, what are you doing?

546
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,350
I... I was just trying to play a prank on mother.

547
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,550
Look at you. What's all the fuss about?

548
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,470
You're idiots!

549
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,310
Hurry up. Get lost.

550
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,070
Get out.

551
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,750
Young master, Madam.

552
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,030
We'll take our leaves then.

553
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,780
Alright.

554
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,910
- Let's go. - Yes.

555
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,830
Come on.

556
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,950
Come here.

557
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,430
What's going on?

558
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,190
Mother, don't tell father about this.

559
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,950
All right.

560
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,950
Really?

561
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,230
But I have some questions for you.

562
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,790
Go ahead.

563
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,470
You dress like this

564
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,900
with the bracelet in your hand.

565
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,950
What do you want to do?

566
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,030
I'm going to pawn it to gamble.

You're having a crush on a girl?

572
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,590
Is she the one in the architect team?

573
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,670
Madam, you misunderstood it.

574
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,470
I'll be honest with you.

575
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,070
Yes.

576
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,870
We're in love.

577
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,230
I hope you'll agree.

578

Take care, young master.

585
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,630
You can leave now.

586
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,510
Sir.

587
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,670
Why did you say that?

588
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,950
If I didn't say so,

589
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,990
my mom would do whatever it takes

590
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,270
to find out the truth

591
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,070
and even investigate it behind my back.

592
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,790
Once she finds out that Master leaves the palace,

593
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,830
and then let my fathers know it,

594
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,470
Master will have to go back to the palace.

595
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,190
That'll be terrible.

596
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,870
But...

597
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,470
Luo, Don’t worry.

598
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,830
I just said we were in love for now.

599
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,310
I didn't say what's gonna happen next.

600
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,660
After a while,

601
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,070
I'll explain to mother.

602
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,390
I won’t hold you back.

603
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,500
That's not what I meant.

604
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,310
Don't worry.

Master doesn't know about this.

607
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,670
So she won't ask anyway.

608
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,420
OK.

609
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,390
All right. Don't be upset.

610
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,830
I owe you a favor.

611
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,950
I will make it up to you in the future.

612
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,110
You promise?

613
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,310
I promise.

614
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,150

Miss Han is from Yangzhou.

617
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,060
She came to Lin'an alone to make a living.

618
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,470
She didn't know anyone

619
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,070
and was almost sold to Yichun Brothel.

620
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,310
Thanks to Liu Yiyun, the most talented girl in Lin'an,

621
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,540
she didn't have to be a prostitute.

622
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,630
Miss Han thought she owed Liu Yiyun too much

623
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,190
and decided to stay with Miss Liu as her maid.

624
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,390
I'd like to say

625
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,310
I really admire you

626
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,110
for being so grateful.

627
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,590
I understand

628

you want to return the favor of Miss Liu.

630
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,550
Miss Han, to be honest,

631
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,710
you're not supposed to be a maid.

632
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,510
You're born to be an architecture supervisor.

633
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,470
And the Wood Feather House

634
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,950
exactly needs a supervisor.

635
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,260
It's destiny that brings us together. Please stay.

636
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,390
That's right, Miss Han.

I'll go back and explain to Miss Liu.

Please tell us

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,590
about the complicated work.

653
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,710
Right.

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,140
How complicated could it be?

655
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,750

the construction of Miss Liu’s resort mansion.

657
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,870
I've asked several teams of architects.

658
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,790
But it was either that Miss Liu was not happy with their design,

659
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,550
or the architects didn't want to do it.

660
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,310
That's why I don't want you to take the job.

about Miss Liu Yiyun being the most talented lady in Lin'an.

00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,510
Wait,

754
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,469
I was in charge last time because they voted for me!

755
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,510
Right!

756
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,230
I don't think he did anything wrong.

757
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,070
What?

758
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,630
Wang Sheng! You traitor!

759
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,550
Don't forget you voted for me too.

760
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,110
That's what happened.

761
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,950
I hope you can understand us.

762
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:01,830
Of course

763
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,430
I will make it up to you.

764

You can choose another ten maids in my mansion.

765

They're well trained by our Meng family.

766

Every one of them is smart and helpful.

767
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,550
Thank you so much.

769
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,630
If you want to work somewhere else, you should have told me earlier.

770
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,110
I see you as my own sister.

771
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,780
I won't make it difficult for you.

772
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,110
I know you are kind to me, Miss.

773
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,510
You helped me out when I was in the darkest hours of my life.

774
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,910
How can I just leave you like this?

775
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,110
Silly girl.

776
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,110
I helped you because I liked you.

777
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,980
I didn't want to see you suffer.

778
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,110
Now you're able to live a good life,

779
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,790
and also have a chance to show your talent.

780
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,470
I'm happy for you.

781
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,110
Miss Liu, you're both talented

and understanding.

783
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,110
Now I see why you're the wisest lady in Lin'an.

784
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,390
I owe you a favor.

785
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,910
If you need me in the future,

786
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,910
just let me know.

787
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,470
In Lin'an City,

788
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,790
there's nothing I can't help.

789
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,270
So do you have any other questions?

790
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,940
Yes, yes, yes.

791
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,990
Since Architect Li has decided to take over this job,

792
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,430
well, about the pay...

793
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,100
Mr. Luo.

794
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,230
How much do you think I should pay you?

795
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,830
Miss Liu, this garden is quite different from other places.

796
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,270
It was built by Master Liu Tong from the previous dynasty.

797
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,550
So it will take lots of efforts for us to refurbish it.

798
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,470
You agree with that, right?

799
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,230
Since you agree,

800
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,750
let me elaborate on the expenditure, Miss Liu.

801
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:22,910
Let me see...

802
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,110
The cost of wood

803
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,390
plus stones and workers,

804
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,220
and...

805
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,870

I didn't get to have a close look at it yesterday.

808
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,470
This garden

809
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,990
is truly amazing.

810
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,470
It's really a masterpiece.

811
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,830

I’ll check it later.

What?

817
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,030
Just the two of us come to work here？

818
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,990
And you want me to measure everything by myself?

819
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,630
Then why do you think I bring you here?

820
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,510
What are you gonna do?

821
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
I’ll go to discuss with Miss Liu

822
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,310
in detail about the reconstruction.

823
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,470

[Huan Cai House]

829
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,230
I'm here today

830
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,270
to hear Miss Liu’s plan for the renovation.

831
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,500
Looking out from here,

832
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,990
I can see the mountains and the mist.

833
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,910
I feel like I'm not staying in Lin'an City

834
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,150
but a paradise.

835
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,350
It makes me feel very relaxed.

836
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,350
But once I look around,

837
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm back to Huan Cai House

838
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,510
and Lin'an City.

839
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,630
It's a change of your state of mind.

840
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,310
Since I moved to Huan Cai House last year,

841
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,230
I've been in love with this house.

842
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,070
It's a better place than my home

843
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,110
and makes me happier.

844
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,390
I love every grass and tree,

845
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,790
and every brick and tile here.

846
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,110
Even when I close my eyes,

847
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,470
I can still feel them.

848
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,550
So every time when I think of

849
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,630
the possibility of me leaving here,

850
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,430
I feel sad.

851
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,910
Miss Liu, have you ever thought about leaving here?

852
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,150
I thought I had another place to go.

853
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,670
But it's just a wishful thinking.

854
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,870
Then I realized

855
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,750
this house is my final destination.

856
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,550
The world is so big.

857
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,990
You can go anywhere.

858
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,060
You know what.

859
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,590
The world is indeed very big.

860
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,990
But there's only one place I belong to.

861
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,110
If I can't go there,

862
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,350
I'll have nowhere else to go.

863
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,790
Turn left in the garden,

864
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,630
you'll see crystal jade lamps with a pearl curtain.

865
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,990
All of those

866
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,380
were set according to my ideas.

867
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,630
But the changes

868
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,110
are all but superficial.

869
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,950
They just appear to be different from before.

870
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,390
So this time

871
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,620
should be the last renovation of this garden.

872
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,270
I hope it will really make a difference.

He?

886
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,590
He asked me to go to Huan Cai House with him early in the morning

887
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,550
to measure the garden.

888
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,870
But he

889
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,310
gave the tool box to me

890
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,030
and let me measure everything all alone.

891
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,350
He left

892
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,870
to discuss the renovation plan with Miss Liu.

893
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,190
That's not what really pissed me off.

Just now,

895
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,470

00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,190
when she met with her friends,

901
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,230
nobody should disturb her.

902
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,110
I'm a colleague of the man inside.

903
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,030
I'm afraid you can't go in.

904
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,510
I hope you can understand.

905
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,300
Drinking and chatting can't mean anything.

906
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,710
I trust Li Qingfeng.

907
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,830
He took this job without consulting any one of us.

908
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:45,950
I'm sure

909
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,070
