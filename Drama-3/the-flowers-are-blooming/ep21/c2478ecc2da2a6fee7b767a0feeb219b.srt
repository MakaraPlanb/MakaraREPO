00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,910
For rebuilding the Fengjiang Tower this time,

5
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,190
the Ministry of Works has gathered all manpower and materials.

6
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,030
This surely will greatly encourage the Three Armies,

7
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,630
and strengthen our military prestige.

8
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,310
We should have done so long ago.

9
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,900
If we had paid more attention to the army,

10
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,190
we wouldn't have been threatened by the Northern Zhou.

11
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,750
Be careful, Mr. Meng.

12
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,190
It's not proper for us to comment at will on state affairs and policies.

13
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,550
Let alone doing so in front of Her Highness.

14
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,470
Lord Situ,

15
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,590
Meng Yuanxu meant no offense.

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,550
Please just ignore him.

17
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,390
Lord Situ, you've devoted a lot to the country, setting a good example for others.

18
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,670
It must have been tough for you to come along

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,110
with lots of arduous tasks and a long way ahead.

20
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,190
So I hope in the future,

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,190
everything will go well with you.

22
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,550
It's my duty to devote myself

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,390
to devote myself to His Majesty and the Xiao Dynasty.

25
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,510
Whatever the cost, I shall never let His Majesty down.

26
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,670
Rise, Lord Situ.

27
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,060
I remember you used to work in the Ministry of War.

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,710
You must have some special feelings

29
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,870
for expanding the Tower.

30
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,110
Yes.

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,340
Speaking of this,

32
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,540
I believe Lord Wang Sheng

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,510
may understand my feeling.

34
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,670
The Fengjiang Tower has always been the holy land in my heart.

35
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,230
It's also where the army spirit of the Xiao Dynasty is.

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,790
The living can keep living on and the dead can be sent back to their hometown.

37
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,670
This is the common wish of all soldiers.

38
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,620
That's right.

39
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,990
This is the common wish of us soldiers.

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,790
The Fengjiang Tower is for rewarding

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,070
the living with military merits.

42
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,660
So there should be another tower.

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,740
for conferring posthumous titles on the dead with military merits.

44
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,590
And that's why His Majesty this time

45
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,390
gave the order to build the Sanjun Tower.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,950
The expanding of the Fengjiang Tower

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,470
and the Sanjun Tower you are in charge of

48
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,070
should both be the top priority.

49
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,670
Isn't this a deserted land?

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,310
Why is it located at a place

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,510
so far away from the main tower?

52
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,030
After the main tower is built,

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,270
the real area it covers

54
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,790
will be three times more than it is now.

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,300
After the Sanjun Tower is built,

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,060
some ancillary sites

57
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,790
need to be added.

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,430
Thus,

59
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,700
between the two towers,

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,470
such a distance must be kept.

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,870
This is also His Majesty's idea.

62
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,980
Your Highness,

63
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,550
I believe His Majesty has discussed this with you.

65
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,470
studied the drawing carefully.

Judging from the drawing,

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,670
this is indeed the best place for building the Sanjun Tower

72
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,950
in terms of both its corresponding to the main tower

73
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,660
and its location.

74
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,950

the terrain under your feet

80
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,829
is getting lower and lower along the way.

81

If I'm not mistaken,

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,430
this place is lower,

83
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,940
much lower

84
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,550
than the place where the Fengjiang Tower stands.

85
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,670
I think you're right.

In general,

88
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,230
this place is more like a pit.

89
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,909
Will low terrain

90
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,909
pose problems to the construction of the Sanjun Tower?

91
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,750
To be exact, it will cause fatal problems.

92
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,990
Is it that serious?

93
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,150
Your Highness, is that true?

94
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,140
This place is indeed a low terrain.

95
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,390
It doesn't matter in usual. But when it is the rainy season,

96
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,420
there will definitely be a flood.

97
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,030
I understand what you said.

98
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,500
It turns out that the rain could be the cause of problems.

99
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,670
But this is already the best place.

100
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,590
There's no better places except here.

101
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,710
What should we do?

102
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,030
It's not that hard.

103
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,150
Since it's lower here,

104
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,270
we can fill it with soil.

105
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,910
Theoretically,

106
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,110
transporting soil is possible.

107

But this place is too large.

108

To get it leveled up with soil,

109
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
it's going to take a lot of time and energy.

110
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,870
And it'll certainly be a grand project.

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,790
But we only have a duration of three months.

112
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,550
No.

113
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,150
We have to shorten the duration to two months.

114
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,300
Two months?

115
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,790
That's even harder.

116
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,990
It must be two months.

117
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,270
What are you afraid of?

118
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,630
Two months is enough for filling this big hole.

119
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,190
If it's just to transport soil,

120
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,950
of course two months will be enough.

122

In this case,

189
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,830
it can be a better choice

190
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,059
when the terrain's in poor condition.

191
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,820
That makes sense.

192
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,950
But don't forget

193
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,950
the purpose of building the Sanjun Tower

194
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,030
is to commemorate those dead warriors of the Xiao Dynasty.

195
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,950
In a Multi-eaved Pagoda,

196
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,150
only the ground storey is big enough for a hall.

197
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,710
I'm afraid

198
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,110
there is not enough space

199
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,470
for so many heroes' memorial tablets.

200
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,390
I know that.

201
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,950
So we can only get the space

202
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,790
inside the Tower ingeniously designed

203
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,060
to expand the room as much as possible.

204
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,910
But this is just my tentative idea.

205
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,790
There are still many practical problems

206
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,780
we need to solve.

207
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,150
So,

208
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,630
I think we need divergent thinking.

209
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,230
Yes.

210
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,030
We need to think from many aspects.

211
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,430
Li Qingfeng.

212
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,790
I couldn't say it when Lord Situ was there.

213
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,310
But look at what you did just now,

214
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,550
have you really been serious about this project?

215
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,220
Don’t you know

216
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,980
how significant it is to me

217
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,390
to build the Sanjun Tower?

218
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,110
I didn't want to do this with you.

219
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,950
but Miss Zhao tried so hard to persuade me.

220
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,270
With your attitude just now,

221
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,030
if you don't want to do it,

222
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,070
I can go to tell the Ministry of Works.

223
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,070
Then I don't need to bother you anymore.

224
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,150
Langyue, I'm not...

225
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,350
I really want to do this with you,

226
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,510
that's my wish.

227
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,790
But what about you?

228
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,380
Langyue, you misunderstood me.

229
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,270
He Zhigu?

230
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,550
What are you doing here?

231
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:14,990
Langyue!

232
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,550
Your Highness, how have you been?

233
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,950
What brings you here, 13th Prince?

234
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,710
I'm here to see my future wife.

235
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Mr. He.

236
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,270
In the Xiao Dynasty,

237
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,980
even if you're engaged,

238
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,110
as long as you're not married,

239
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,990
words like this are seen as offensive.

240
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,230
Besides, the one you offended was the princess.

241
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,390
You must apologize.

242
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,710
Miss Zhao, I've heard that

243
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,870
you've been looking for a husband for many years,

244
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,070
but you still haven't met a good match.

245
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,220
I'm afraid you're a bit stiff about the relationship between men and women.

246
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,870
If you can abandon the stereotypes

247
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,110
and be more proactive,

248
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,350
I believe

249
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,870
you may be able to meet your Mr. Right soon.

250
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,670
How about this?

251
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,110
I can introduce to you

252
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,750
some good men in the Northern Zhou.

253
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,230
You...

254
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,070
13th Prince.

255
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,230
She's my friend.

256
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,710
You can't be so rude to her.

257
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,750
You misunderstood me, your Highness.

258
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,310
I sincerely want to help Miss Zhao.

259
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,350
Besides,

260
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,550
in two months,

261
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,870
you will become the princess consort of the Northern Zhou.

262
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,990
To facilitate marriages across our two states

263
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,870
can contribute to the peace.

264
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,670
We are all guests.

265
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,190
Since Prince Yelü is here,

266
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,750
please have a cup of tea.

267
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,230
Fine.

268
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,270
Please.

269
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,350
Qingfeng, you...

270
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,190
Please wait a moment.

271
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,670
I shall brew the best Biluochun Green tea for you.

272
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,950
Mr. Li knows better about how to treat guests.

273
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,750
As the saying goes, a wise man knows what's best for him.

274
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,750
Mr. Li's sure to have a promising future.

275
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,950
Your Highness.

276
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,430
Your Highness, I heard from His Majesty that

277
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,390
you've worked day and night for this project.

278
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,390
In my opinion,

279
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,590
it's meaningless for you

280
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,550
to build the Fengjiang Tower.

281
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,270
What's the point?

282
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,870
There's no need for you to worry about the state affairs of the Xiao Dynasty.

283
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,590
The state affairs of the Xiao Dynasty are also our...

284
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,190
family affairs.

285
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,380
Right?

286
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,550
Have some tea.

287
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,790
It's really good tea.

288
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,270
It seems that Mr. Li is treating me

289
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,830
with sincerity.

290
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,270
If that's the case,

291
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,230
I might as well make friends with Mr. Li.

292
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,910
It seems

293
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,550
I really have got a good friend.

294
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,790
Thanks for your appreciation.

295
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,550
Your Highness, I came today

296
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,990
to invite you to play polo [a horseback ball game].

297
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,910
But there are so many trivial matters.

298
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,230
How about this?

299
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,590
Let's play together tomorrow noon.

300
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,550
Play polo?

301
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,190
I’ve asked for His Majesty's permission.

302
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,150
His Majesty said

303
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,790
the work would be handed over to the Ministry of Works.

304
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,950
Then you don't have to worry about it anymore.

305
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,990
Are you using His Majesty to oppress me?

306
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,910
Your Highness, I didn’t mean that.

307
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,070
Please just do me the favor.

308
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,870
If you want to play polo,

309
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,340
why not come to my field.

310
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,510
Not a bad idea.

311
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,510
I heard that the field of the Zhao's family

312
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,310
is the most magnificent one in Lin'an.

313
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,590
I also want to go to have a look.

314
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,510
It's a deal then.

315
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,830
Mr. Li, I hope you can come with us

316
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,670
so that we can have a duel.

317
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,550
See you.

318
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,990
Then I'll also go there.

319
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,830
It's up to you.

320
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,510
Li Qingfeng, what’s wrong with you?

321
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,790
There’s laxative in the tea.

322
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,630
Qingfeng, well done.

323
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,510
This damn prince!

324
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,860
His nature gets exposed so soon.

325
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,590
He's just getting more and more annoying.

326
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,910
I wronged you.

327
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,750
Well done.

328
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,620
My lady, Architect Li.

329
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,790
Dishese are ready.

330
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,550
[Methods of Tower-building]

331
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,470
I'm not hungry.

332
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,550
My Lady,

333
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,310
you haven't had anything for a whole day.

334
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,230
You go first.

335
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,070
I'll eat later.

336
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,230
You go first.

337
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,590
Let's go to eat.

338
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,470
I said I would eat later.

339
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,990
What are you doing?

340
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,550
Humans need food

341
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,110
to maintain energy and vitality.

342
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,350
So in order to have

343
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,830
better ability and status to think

344
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,430
and to search information quickly,

345
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,430
we need to have a meal now.

346
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,630
No.

347
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,310
When looking into the information,

348
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,070
my brain runs fast.

349
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,350
Once I get interrupted,

350
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,870
it will be hard to get into the state again.

351
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,150
I don't know how much time it will take

352
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,510
to return back to that state.

353
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,070
The harder it's for me to get into the state, the more impatient I will be.

354
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,630
The more impatient I am, the harder it will be for me to get into the state.

355
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,630
If it keeps going like this,

356
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,510
it won't only take 30 minutes.

357
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,670
You're exaggerating it.

358
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,270
I'm telling the truth.

359
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,790
Let's go to eat.

360
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,230
Let me go.

361
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,350
No.

362
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,550
You're just an architect.

363
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,590
You don't even listen to the princess?

364
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,470
You are disrespectful.

365
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,830
You'd better punish me

366
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,830
and get me exiled to the Northern Zhou.

367
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,980
Be good.

368
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,590
I won't go if you don't let go.

369
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,310
I won't let go if you don't eat.

370
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,590
What are you doing?

371
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,740
Even you are bullying me.

372
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,630
I'm not.

373
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,630
You don't think the Fengjiang Tower is important,

374
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,150
but I do.

375
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,350
This is my last job in the Xiao.

376
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,860
I think it's very important.

377
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,470
I just want you to have some food.

378
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,070
Do you know how urgent it is?

379
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,430
As long as there is no solution,

380
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,590
we shall not be able to start working.

381
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,470
If I don't start working now,

382
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,180
Yelü Zhigu is going to come to take me away to marry me.

383
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,470
Langyue.

384
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,750
I don't believe warfare between the two states

385
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,260
can be affected by the so-called "marriage for peace".

386
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,990
Even if you're married to the Northern Zhou,

387
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,350
they will still start a war.

388
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,950
I didn't expect

389
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,590
you are so naive.

390
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,110
Where are you going?

391
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,830
To eat.

392
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,230
Langyue.

393
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,109
The Northern Zhou people are all bastards,

394
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,829
especially that damn prince.

395
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,030
How dare he bully my master?

396
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,540
If he is in front of me now,

397
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,869
believe it or not, I'll kill him.

398
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,470
Mr. Meng.

399
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,310
We all know your courage.

400
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,020
But is it real that,

401
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,630
as the rumor goes,

402
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,950
the prince of the Northern Zhou forces Princess Zhaohe to marry him?

403
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,310
Do you want to die?

404
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,950
This is not something we can talk about.

405
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,270
It was my fault.

406
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,750
I shall take a drink as punishment.

407
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,990
Let's not talk about this.

408
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,790
I got you here today

409
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,750
to ask you

410
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,190
whether you can

411
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,110
fill a big hole with soil

412
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,790
in a short time?

413
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,750
This is urgent.

414
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,190
Fill a hole with soil?

415
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,430
Official,

416
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,350
I'm afraid none of us

417
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,550
are good at it.

418
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,700
That's right, Official.

419
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,550
Besides,

420
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,030
it’s just a construction project.

421
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,470
Do you have to be so anxious

422
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,790
about it?

423
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,870
It's none of your business.

424
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,590
Mr. Meng.

425
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,230
Aren't the craftsmen of the Wood Feather House experts in it?

426
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,390
Do I need to ask you if I can solve it?

427
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,630
Obviously we are in trouble.

428
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,910

429
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,830

Then all of you need to

try everything

433
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,070
to find all architects in Lin'an City.

434
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,790
Ask them the question I just asked you

435
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,150
and let each one of them figure out a way.

436
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,470
Whoever can solve this problem,

437
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,950
I will give him 100 taelss of silver as a reward.

438
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,110
No, 200.

439
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,230
No, no,

442
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,740
Mr. Meng, don't worry.

443
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,150
We'll try our best...

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,550
to help you.

445
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,910
In fact, I know that

446
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,300
even Li Qingfeng can't do anything,

447
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,550
let alone others.

448
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,190
I'm really angry.

449
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,390
Forget it.

450
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,150
We are brothers.

451
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,990
There's nothing to be afraid of.

452
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,190
That's right.

453
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,020
The bastard prince of the Northern Zhou

454
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,190
did force Her Highness, the Princess Zhaohe,

455
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,030
to marry him.

456
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,790
I grew up with my master

457
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,470
and have a deep friendship with her.

458
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,950
But now, I can only

459
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,790
wait for that bastard prince to take my master away.

460
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,750
I can't bear this.

461
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,110
Do you have any idea?

462
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,430
Xu Yunrui, you always have the most tricks.

463
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,460
You tell me.

464
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,710
Actually, I have an idea.

465
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,030
But it's a bit risky.

466
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,790
Tell me.

467
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,590
Yes.

468
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,630
No matter what it is,

469
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,150
I'll listen to it first.

470
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,270
It's still from the 36 strategies.

471

Six words.

Make it simple!

474
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,470
We still

475
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,550
hand over the princess

476
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,990
to the Escorting Team of the Northern Zhou's on the wedding day.

477
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,790
But then we can secretly find some people

to pretend to be robbers

on their way back to the Northern Zhou.

480
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,660
And that's actually a way of saving the princess.

481
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,710
Wouldn't it be obvious that it is us?

482
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,510
The Northern Zhou people are evil, but they are not stupid.

483
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,310
Don't worry, Mr. Meng.

484
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,030

Your name is not on the banquet list.

Here's the thing.

When I was in trouble,

Mr. Han Zhongzheng once offered me help

534

So it's no surprise that you've heard of it.

559
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,830
Luo Ye...

560
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,830
Since I'v made it hard for you,

561
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,470
and I'm not a shameless guy,

562
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,630
I'd better come visit

563
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,030
on the wedding day.

564
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,070
See you. See you.

565
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,580
Thank you for your understanding.

566
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,110
Luo Ye...

567
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,150
Go invite my father here.

568
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,910
I have something to tell him.

569
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,550
I’m afraid I can’t do it.

570
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,070
Boss Luo!

571
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,190
Why are you here in Yangzhou?

572
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,510
You know the reason.

573
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,030
He, he, he...

574
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,150
He really plays tricks.

575
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,030
It's all because his horse runs faster.

576
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,190
It's not that his horse runs faster.

577
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,110
The Northern Zhou people ride horses everyday.

578
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,910
So they are really good at it.

579
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,230
In this aspect,

580
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,390
He Zhigu indeed does a better job than Architect Li.

581
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,110
Cut the crap.

582
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,220
As long as we take control of Mr. He's interior line,

583
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,190
it can make up for the shortage of speed.

584
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,980
You may get hit by the polo ball. You won't mind that, will you?

585
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,910
Of course I won't.

586
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,060
Then I shall score the first goal.

587
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
But I don’t understand.

588
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,150
He doesn't match up to you.

589
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,270
Why does your father insist in marrying you to him?

590
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,510
Because he's obedient to my father.

591
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,190
I can also be obedient.

592
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,310
Boss Luo, you don’t understand.

593
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,910
Do you remember

594
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,430
you once bought me a stick of sugar-coated haws?

595
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,990
I said it was the first time I ate it in five years

596
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,750
because my father didn't allow me.

597
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,670
All these years,

598
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,910
I did whatever my father told me to do.

599
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,150
I dared not disobey him.

600
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,030
If my father asked me to eat,

601
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,710
I had to eat the whole bowl of rice.

602
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,110
If my father didn't allow me to have food,

603
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,990
then no matter how hungry I was, I dared not even have a sip of water.

604
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,750
But...

605
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,830
Actually, I fled to Lin'an

606
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,630
not for escaping the marriage.

607
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,310
I just wanted to escape from my father's control.

608
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,070
He said he did everything for my own good.

609
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,230
But in my opinion,

610
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,550
it was like a nightmare.

611
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,190
Now the nightmare is worse.

612
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,550
I can’t get out of it.

613
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,310
But no matter what,

614
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,710
you can’t do such a stupid thing.

615
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,990
I saw Dong Dacheng,

616
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,950
the man I was going to marry,

617
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,830
secretly dated the eldest daughter of the Qi family.

618
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,030
But the Qi family is the biggest bussiness rival of the Han Family.

619
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,190
So I told my father about it.

620
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,230
But my father thought it was my excuse for not marrying Dong Dacheng.

621
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,630
He would rather believe an outsider

622
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,110
than me.

623
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,910
If I'm married to him,

624
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,910
then I might as well just die.

625
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,710
How did Dong Dacheng

626
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,510
win your father’s trust?

627
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,790
I told you.

628
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,950
Because he's obedient to my father

629
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,910
and is willing to be controlled by my father.

630
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,950
Even if asked to be a matrilocal son-in-law,

631
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,990
and let his child's surname be Han instead of Dong,

632
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,630
he still said yes without hesitation.

633
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,510
He's quite shrewd and deep.

634
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,990
Niaoniao.

635
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,430
Don’t worry.

636
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,270
As long as I'm here,

637
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,390
I will try everything to take you back to Lin'an.

638
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,270
Leave the rest to me.

639
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,910
I shall take this.

640
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,870
Coming.

641
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,540
Li Qingfeng.

642
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,750
Thanks.

643
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,670
Li Qingfeng,

644
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,590
are you alright?

645
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,790
I'm fine.

646
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,510
Master, did you see that?

647
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,710
Such a catty, vile and dirty bastard!

648
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,670
In the next half session of the one-on-one duel,

649
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,710
don't show him any mercy.

650
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,390
Langyue, pass it over.

651
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,230
Chase!

652
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,270
[Roasted Tofu]

653
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,590
It's so comfortable.

654
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,310
The Prince of the Northern Zhou was so arrogant at the beginning.

655
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,230
But finally he became a beaten dog.

656
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,910
I'm so happy to see him like that.

657
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,950
Her Highness and Architect Li

658
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,670
really disgraced him.

659
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,830
Master, I'm so proud to be your disciple.

660
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,070
Master, what's wrong?

661
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,830
Did you make Master angry again?

662
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,470
Master, look.

663
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,820
So what even if we won?

664
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,540
Right. So what?

665
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,990
Master is still leaving.

666
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,030
The problem of the Fengjiang Tower hasn't been solved yet.

667
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,790
Li Qingfeng,

668
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,350
have you come up with an idea?

669
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,180
[Li's Mansion]

670
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,710
I went to play polo.

671
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,820
It's not easy to find you.

672
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,950
Just say it.

673
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,750
I still have work to do.

674
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,070
You mean the Fengjiang Tower, right?

675
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,590
How did you know?

676
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,150
Of course I knew it.

677
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,590
Your Wood Feather House is responsible for building the Sanjun Tower.

678
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,030
But the terrain at that location is too low,

679
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,630
so you're afraid of waterlogging.

680
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,500
And that's why you couldn't carry forward the project.

681
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,790
Am I right?

682
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,510
Just solve the problem you're met with.

683
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,710
You grew up

684
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,150
never having been so discouraged.

685
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,429
The problem is different this time.

686
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,790
I've checked all the information about the building of towers.

687
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,590
But I still got no solution.

688
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,989
It seems that you've lost your basic judgment

689
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,550
because of your feelings.

690
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,550
What do you mean?

691
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,389
All you read was about building towers.

692
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,870
But why don't you check

693
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,909
how to deal with the terrain?

694
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,870
We have discussed about the terrain.

695
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,550
The only way is to level up the terrain with soil.

696
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,350
But the construction requires too much.

697
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,910
Langyue is going to leave in two months.

698
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,870
We don't have enough time at all.

699
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,350
I understand what you said.

700
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,430
I mean the way to level up the terrain with soil.

701
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,990
Have you ever thought about it?

702
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,830
The way to level up the terrain with soil?

703
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,030
For any problem,

704
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,380
you have to find out the root cause

705
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,110
and the most potential breakthrough.

706
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,070
Only in this way

707
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,070
can you work towards the right direction.

708
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,950
Otherwise,

709
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,870
you will only get stuck

710
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,990
and even run towards the opposite direction like right now.

711
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,990
To find a breakthrough?

712
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,980
That is... the way to level up the terrain...

713
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,620
I was wrong.

714
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,310
I was wrong.

715
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,870
This is the relief map of Lin'an City I drew myself.

716
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,150
It mainly covers the routes from the Sanjun Tower

717
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,510
to every spot where you can get soil

718
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,870
inside and outside the city.

719
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,990
Take it back and study it.

720
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,350
What are you waiting for? Take it.

721
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,830
You...

722
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,350
I'm your father. If you're in trouble,

723
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,180
I'll certainly help you.

724
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,870
If your problem is solved,

725
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,630
then what about my problem?

726
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,620
[Han's Mansion]

727
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,870
There are so many people today.

728
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,780
Sorry for not taking good care of you.

729
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,750
Please forgive me.

730
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,510
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

731
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,030
Take care.

732
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,710

734
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,310
Sir, this is our last guest.

735
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,860
Thank you for your hard work today.

736
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,270
Steward Xu.

737
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,670
don't say that.

738
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,590
This is what I'm supposed to do.

739
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,870
By the way, I want to ask Steward Xu

740
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,150
if I did anything inappropriate today?

741
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,870
please give me some advice.

742
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,380
Don’t say that.

743
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,140
You're too modest.

744
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,790
His Lord has chosen the right son-in-law.

745
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,870
That's a wrap for today.

746
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,110
Please go back

747
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,670
to rest.

748
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,110
OK. I shall go back.

749
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,700
See you tomorrow.

750
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,100
Sir, after the engagement banquet,

751
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,870
there will be lots of trivial matters for the Han Family to prepare.

752
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,790
So it will be inconvenient for you to come these days.

753
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,630
You can just wait to get married.

754
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,510
That's right. Okay.

755
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,830
I’m leaving.

756
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,240
[Nature's Treasures]

757
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,550
Take care.

758
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:29,990
Okay.

759
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,190
Good.

760
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,550
[Angui Restaurant]

761
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,400
[Angui Restaurant]

762
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,390
Okay, you can leave now.

763
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,870
Sir.

764
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,030
Please come in and have a look.

765
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,190
Why are you leaving?

766
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,310
Sir.

767
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,390
No, no, no.

768
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,870
No, no, no.

769
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,270
Come and have a look.

770
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,590
Sir.

771
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,870
That's weird...

772
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,310
He does look like a decent man, huh!

773
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,350
I know, you have born a grudge against me

774
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,540
for what I did to your mother.

775
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,630
You think it was what I did that hurt her

776
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,790
and led to her depression and death.

777
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,630
I admit that

778
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,030
I should be blamed for your mother's suffering.

779
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,390
But...

780
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,710
What?

781
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,300
When you say something like this,

782
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,030
there's always a "but".

783
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,030
There's no "but" this time.

784
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,270
It was indeed my fault.

785
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,430
I let both your mother

786
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,310
and you down.

787
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,220
Back then, if I married your mother as my first wife,

788
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,390
I would offend Vice-Minister of the Department of State Affairs.

789
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,030
Then my future career

790
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,870
would be ruined.

791
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,270
I couldn't accept it.

792
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,550
It cost me ten years to secure an official position.

793
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,990
I worked so hard to run official connections

794
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,630
and build my own career.

795
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,550
Then finally to ask me to give up all of them?

796
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,030
At that time,

797
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,710
I really couldn't accept that.

798
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,390
You never told me

799
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,430
about these things.

800
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,870
Now I really regret it.

801
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,390
If there is a chance to start over,

802
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,110
I would definitely make a different choice.

803
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,270
I will follow my heart

804
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,350
no matter how terrible the price I have to pay.

805
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,270
Do you know

806
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,430
how long I've waited for you to say that?

807
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,390
I know.

808
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,950
These words can't change

809
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,270
the fact that I hurt your mother and you.

810
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,550
But Qingfeng,

811
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,830
can you forgive me?

812
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,740
In my heart,

813
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,470
you are still a coward.

814
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,750
But

815
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,910
I won't hate you anymore.

816
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,910
I did bear a grudge against you for my mother's death

817
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,190
for many years.

818
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,790
I also hated you for many years.

819
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,310
But what I hate more is that for so many years,

820
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,470
you have never apologized for this.

821
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,430
Hearing what you said just now,

822
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,030
I think I won't blame you anymore.

823
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,230
Father.
