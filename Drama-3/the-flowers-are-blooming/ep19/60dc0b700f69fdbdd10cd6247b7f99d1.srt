00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,990
Li Qingfeng.

5
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,470
Meeting you

6
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,910
was the best thing that's ever happened to me.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,100
When I first met you,

8
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,270
I thought you were like a piece of wood,

9
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,700
boring and unromantic.

10
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,950
But later I noticed that during every construction project

11
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,670
you seemed to be so gifted in it.

12
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,060
You can always get the best parts of those constructions

13
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,150
fully presented.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,100
You seem aloof and arrogant in usual,

15
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,150
but actually you're a very warm man.

16
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,670
You are different from

17
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,710
any architect I've ever met.

18
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,710
It's lucky for Lin’an to have you.

19
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,910
Only with you here

can Lin'an become more and more beautiful.

22
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,150
It's luckier for Xiao to have you.

23
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,430
In this way, the buildings of the Xiao Dynasty

24
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,150
will be recorded in history.

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,990
Yet the luckiest thing for me is

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,630
having met you.

27
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,590
In every building project,

28
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,070
I could saw a better you.

29
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,830
And that was also lucky for me.

30
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,670
Although

31
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,630
I may not be qualified to be the prince consort,

32
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,430
and His Majesty may not like me,

33
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,300
but I swear

34
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,940
I’m the one

35
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,390
who loves you most in the world.

36
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,150
I will prove it to everyone.

37
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,550
I, Li Qingfeng,

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,710
definitely will deserve Princess Zhaohe.

39
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,710
Okay. Get on the boat.

40
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,150
Maybe you should just wait here?

41
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,230
Are you worried about the quality of this boat?

42
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,390
Of course not.

43
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,620
You are the princess.

44
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,750
Just leave it to us.

45
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,110
I am the princess.

46
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,310
It's the reason why I should get on the boat.

47
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,790
Let's go.

48
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,390
Be careful.

49
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,830
In order to test whether this method is feasible,

50
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,470
more people are needed on the boat to increase the total weight.

51
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,110
Can it stand up to the weight?

52
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,140
It definitely can.

53
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,390
You coward!

54
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,870
Let me do it.

55
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,030
Come, Chief Xu.

56
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,310
I'm not afraid of it.

57
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,470
-Be careful. -Okay.

58
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:55,870
Okay.

59
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,590
Take care.

60
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,150

I'll return to Lin'an tomorrow along with other members of the Wood Feather House.

103
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,670
Then I'll go back to the palace.

She went out with Wang Sheng

118

and hasn't come back.

119
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,150
That's kinda strange...

120
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,550
I shall thank you.

121

Why didn't she wait for us?

135
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,070
And she will never come back to the Wood Feather House.

136
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,150

and stay with you.

160
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,750
I will be your deputy architect,

Don't hold it alone.

167

How about going out for a walk with Niaoniao and I?

168
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,870
Or just you and me.

169
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,590
We can go to Yi Mu Restaurant

173
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,700
Li Qingfeng, come out!

174
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,830
If you don’t come out, I’ll kick the door!

175
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,750
I mean it!

176
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,510
Step back.

177
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,110
Each of the door costs 20 tael.

178
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,350
Li Qingfeng,

179
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,630
your skill of coming and going silently

180
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,750
is almost as good as Wang Sheng.

181
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,990
I just went out for a walk.

182
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,870
Why are you doing this?

183
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,230
I'm just worried about you.

184
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,230
Miss Zhao,

185
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,510
did Qingfeng go to you?

186
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
I came across him on the street.

187
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,870
He seemed to have lost his soul.

188
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,830
Qingfeng, are you alright?

189
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,430
Now in this yard,

190
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,430
there are only the four of us, right?

191
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,710

00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,750

195

I just don't understand

196
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,310
why she left without saying goodbye.

197
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,750
She has already told me everything.

198
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,950

199
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,580
Everyone can see her affection for you.

200
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,660
So she wouldn't do so without a reason.

201
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,980
Miss Zhao is right.

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,300
How about this?

203
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,550
We can turn to Official Meng for help.

204
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,630
Maybe he can get some information from inside the palace.

Have some food please.

211

It has been three days since you returned to the palace,

212
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,870
but you have not eaten nothing.

213
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,220
If this goes on...

214
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,910
I won't eat it. Take it away.

215
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,190
Your Highness!

216
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,310
We're begging of you.

217
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,110
We dare not take the food

218

back to the imperial kitchen.

219
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,430
Please spare us.

220
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,230
Then go feed the dogs and cats.

221
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,390
This...

222

Enough!

223
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,550
Go tell his Majesty,

224
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,390
it's better for me to stay hungry.

Please spare us.

Please spare us.

227
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,430
Slow down, Your Highness.

228
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,500
Or you're gonna choke on it.

229
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,750
Told you so!

230
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,270
Your Highness,

231
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,630
do you think it is really going to work?

232
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,910
I don't know if it will work or not.

233
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,270
But

234
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,270
I must make His Majesty understand my attitude.

235
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,430
I don't believe

236
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,190
he would watch me starve to death.

237
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,550
But His Majesty hasn’t come yet.

238
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,030
Maybe he saw you when you went out to buy the drumsticks?

239
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,990
Mr. Meng bought it from outside the palace

240
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,630
and asked Lord Wang to bring it back.

241
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,270
I don’t think His Majesty noticed me.

242
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,270
Maybe Wang Sheng betrayed me.

243
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,500
I don’t think so.

244
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,030
How about this time

246
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,270
Your Highness, it's not gonna work I think.

247
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,390
Then what else can I do?

248
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,590
If this continues,

249
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,110
Li Qingfeng will think I have given up on our relationship.

261
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm afraid this time

262
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,100
you may have to stand a loss.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,030
But I can pay it for you.

264

No matter what,

265
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,870
I will find a way to pay you back.

As for Li Qingfeng,

269
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,630
it can really be tough for him.

270
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,230
Maybe only as time goes by

271
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,220
can Architect Li gradually cheer up.

"Yelü" is the royal surname of the Northern Zhou.

380
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,670
So

381
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,510
he did reveal his identity.

382
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,350
But we didn't realize it.

383
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,910
I didn't expect

384
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,030
there was such an episode

385
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,430
on the night of the Zhongyuan Festival.

386
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,910
It was just a coincidence.

387
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,140
Not long after you left,

388
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,310
Li Qingfeng and I

389
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,150
met Miss Chen and him at a lantern shop.

390
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,510
At that time, Li Qingfeng obviously

391
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,310
misunderstood their relationship.

392
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,550
What does the He...

393
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,260
What on earth does this Prince of the Northern Zhou

394
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,750
want to do?

395
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,590
Obviously, he intends to force Langyue to marry him.

396
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,910
This barbarian of the Northern Zhou

397
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,910
claimed to have fallen in love with Master at first sight.

398
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,790
But in fact, he's just greedy for Master's beauty.

399
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,750
He's shamelessly threatening his Majesty to marry my Master to him

400
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,990
with the Northern Zhou's strong military power.

401
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm so pissed off.

402
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,270
If I had known it,

403
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,230
I should have instigated Li Qingfeng

404
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,270
to kill him together with me.

405
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,270
We can't do whatever he asks us to do.

406
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,380
Her Highness hasn't said yes to it, has she?

407
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,140
Master has no choice.

408
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,150
Otherwise, how could she leave without saying goodbye in Jinnan?

409
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,670
It must be that his Majesty personally took her away that day.

410
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,070
But...

411
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,670
Can't we just turn him down?

412
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,830
According to my father,

413
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,870
our country made a lot of efforts

414
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,590
into making this marriage a success.

415
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,660
If the marriage fails,

416
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,110
the Northern Zhou will have the reason to invade us.

417
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,390
You have no idea.

418
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,390
The Northern Zhou has been

419
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,910
challenging us near the border these years,

420
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,430
and repeatedly crossed the border line to provoke us.

421
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,110
Its purpose is to invade us.

422
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,150
So his Majesty chose to make peace with them by marriage

423
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,030
because he didn't want the people in the border

424
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,270
suffer from wars,

425
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,510
nor did he want the Xiao thus to get destroyed.

426
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,910
Is the state power of the Northern Zhou

427
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,070
much stronger than ours?

428
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,790
I'm not sure.

429
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,870
You can ask Wang Sheng about it later.

430
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,630
Anyway, now it seems

431
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,150
Master really has no choice.

432
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,150
Wait.

433
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,350
There are so many princesses in the Xiao Dynasty.

434
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,790
Why must it be Princess Zhaohe?

435
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,270
Speaking of this, I'm even more angry.

436
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,630
The damn King of the Northern Zhou

437
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,550
specifically asked for Princess Zhaohe.

438
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:34,870
Think about it.

439
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,740
It's really an insult for marrying our emperor's younger sister

440
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,590
to his son, isn't it?

441
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,820
I’m so pissed off!

442
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,150
Do you remember the Miss Liu from the Huan Cai House?

443
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,270
You mean Her Highness and Architect Li will also...

444
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,550
No way.

445
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,790
According to Li Qingfeng’s personality, I think he's very likely to...

446
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,430
God, bless us.

447
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,910
It's alright if they elope.

448
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,110
But don't let them die for each other.

449
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,030
[Zhaohe Palace]

450
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,350
Luo, don’t worry.

451
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,230
After I settle down,

452
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,270
I’ll try my best to inform you.

453
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,420
But I still don't want to leave you.

454
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,390
Do you want me to go to the Northern Zhou?

455
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,070
Even if you're married to the Northern Zhou,

456
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,070
I can still stay by your side every day.

457
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,630
But now,

458
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,390
I don’t know when I can see you again.

459
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,990
Silly girl.

460
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,230
In a year or so, if His Majesty still can't find me,

461
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,110
then the marriage will have to be renounced.

462
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,390
Then I'll return back to the palace.

463
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,030
You think he'll really kill me for it?

464
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,660
Of course not.

465
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,230
That's right.

466
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,910
So listen to me.

467
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,670
After I leave the palace,

468
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,870
take the sleeping pill on the table

469
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,230
to sleep for a while,

470
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,270
then I will be free.

471
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,390
By then,

472
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,150
you can just wait for me to come back,

473
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,950
okay?

474
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,870
Luo,

475
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,710
I’m leaving.

476
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,110
Do wait for me.

477
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,630
If you feel bored,

478
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,070
you can go to play Pai Gow [a Chinese gambling game] with Meng Yuanxu.

479
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,470
Anyway,

480
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,510
don't cry.

481
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Don't worry about me.

482
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,070
Okay?

483
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,870
I'm leaving.

484
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,670
Your Highness.

485
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,910
I don't know when I'll return.

486
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,990
But with you by my side,

487
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,910
I can feel at ease.

488
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,910
Do you know where we are now?

489
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,100
No.

490
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,750
Great.

491
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,990
Even you don't know,

492
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,550
then let alone others.

493
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,790
Where are you taking me to?

494
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,950
Somewhere deep in the woods.

495
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,190
Then I'll build a Zhaohe Palace for you there.

496
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,470
I don't want to live in a Zhaohe Palace.

497
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,350
I prefer a Langyue Palace.

498
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,750
Then how about I build you a Qingfeng Lanyue Palace?

499
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,230
Qingfeng Langyue Palace!

500
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,630
Actually, we can keep pressing ahead.

501
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,990
It's cold at night.

502
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,470
Let's rest here.

503
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,950
I don't think they'll catch up so soon.

504
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,350
Please bless us.

505
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,030
Bless Qingfeng and I can be together forever.

506
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,870
Even if having to wander around the world,

507
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,390
I will never regret.

508
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,190
Langyue!

509
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,920

538

Li Qingfeng, do you admit your crime?

539
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,020
Brother,

540
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,510
it’s not his fault.

541
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,350
It was I who instigated Li Qingfeng...

542
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,980
Langyue.

543
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,790
Li Qingfeng.

544
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,670
I’m asking you,

545
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,630
do you admit your crime?

546
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,390
What did I do wrong?

547
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,350
Princess is about to get married,

548
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,110
how dare you make her escape from the palace with you?

549
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,270
Do you respect the court?

550
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,550
Do you know the Law of the Xiao Dynasty?

551
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,550
May I ask you a question?

552
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,710
Today it's Princess Zhaohe to be married for peace.

553
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,540
Then which princess will be the next one?

554
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,110
Does it mean only by marrying princesses to other states

555
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,350
can the Xiao Dynasty get peace?

556
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,430
Guards.

557
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,070
Yes.

558
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,310
Get Li Qingfeng arrested.

559
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,550
Yes.

560
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,430
Brother!

561
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,590
Get him executed at noon tomorrow.

562
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,630
along with his entire family.

563
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,070
-Brother! -Yes.

564
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,790
Brother, don't!

565
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,670
You're the princess of the Xiao Dynasty.

566
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,190
How dare you elope with such a rebellious guy?

567
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,030
How inappropriate!

568
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,510
I just don't want to marry Yelü Zhigu.

569
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,270
I've made up my mind.

570
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,350
Stop messing around!

571
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,310
Brother!

572
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,630
Do I have to die in front of you

573
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,790
so that you'll let me go?

574
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,270
Langyue!

575
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,510
Fine!

576
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,630
Tomorrow at noon,

577
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,470
I shall get you, together with Li Qingfeng,

578
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,110
Li Jie's entire family,

579
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,310
your maid [Luo],

580
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,550
Meng Zhongshan’s son,

581
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,110
and that traitor Wang Sheng

582
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,310
all executed!

583
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,310
Go back to the palace.

584
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,070
Your Majesty.

585
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,630
If I agree to get married to the Northern Zhou,

586
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,750
will you spare them?

587
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,550
Langyue!

588
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,230
After marrying you there, wars between the two states will be stopped.

589
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,270
Then there naturally will be a general amnesty.

590
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,510
Okay.

591
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,390
I accept the marriage.

592
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,830
Li Qingfeng.

593
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,110
From now on,

594
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,820
you and me

595
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,790
are done.

596
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,110
Langyue!

597
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,430
Langyue!

598
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,510
Langyue!

599
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,500
Langyue!

600
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,390
Langyue!

601
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,430
Langyue!

602
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,550
[To my Deceased Mother, Madam Ru of Li Jie's Family]

603
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,950
Mom, was I wrong?

604
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,910
I really don't know what to do.

605
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,950
Please tell me.

606
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,670
Qingfeng!

607
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,840
[Memorial to the throne]

608
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,470
Take a look.

609
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,510
If you were me, what would you do?

610
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,770
[Memorial to the throne]

611
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,070
The Northern Zhou has long coveted the wealth of us.

612
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,630
So they've repeatedly provoked us around the border .

613
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,590
People there have been suffering a lot.

614
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,150
If we fight with them,

615
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,270
we can't ignore the Northern Zhou's military force is much stronger than ours.

616
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,030
If we make peace with them, then marriage is the only choice.

617
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,790
And what the Northern Zhou required

618
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,310
was to marry the eldest princess to them.

619
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,190
It's also a humiliation for me.

620
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,740
But I have no choice.

621
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,950
It's not that I don't want to let you go, Chen Langyue.

622
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,540
It's that I can't let go

623
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,350
of thousands of people in the Xiao.

624
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,110
Brother,

625
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,590
I see.

626
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,670
Li Qingfeng is right.

627
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,270
The peace of the Xiao Dynasty

628
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,710
can't always be won by groveling.

629
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,909
So I have decided

630
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,590
the Fengjiang Tower will be rebuilt to revitalize the Three Armies.

631
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:44,989
Langyue.

632
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,989
I trust you.

633
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,710
So till now,

634
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,270
I have no intention to restrict your freedom.

635
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,790
I even...

636
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,350
hope you can participate in this.

637
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,110
You can just consider it as

638
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,310
my last gift for you.

639
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,850
[To my Deceased Mother, Madam Ru of Li Jie's Family]

640
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,910
When coming to visit my mother before,

641
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,710
I could often find someone had been here.

642
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,190
In this world,

643
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,710
only you and me

644
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,140
still remember to come here.

645
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,830
I'm going back to the Wood Feather House.

646
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,870
So what?

647
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,550
The marriage of Her Highness has been settled.

648
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,350
You...

649
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,830
know everything?

650
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,070
It's spread all over the court.

651
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,670
How can I not know?

652
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,030
Qingfeng,

653
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,670
for the Li family,

654
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,470
don't hold fantasy about Her Highness anymore.

655
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,190
Do you only care about the Li family?

656
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,670
Aren't you a member of the Li family?

657
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,580
I am only myself.

658
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,870
I know

659
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,390
you've always thought

660
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,710
your mother's death was caused by me.

661
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,790
Back then, your mother and I secretly got married.

662
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,230
But in the end, Xu became my wife.

663
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,470
So I could only take your mother as my concubine.

664
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,710
But I had my reasons.

665
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,030
Everything in this world happens for its own reasons.

666
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,710
But I've had enough of your reasons.

667
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,740
[To my Deceased Mother, Madam Ru of Li Jie's Family]

668
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,870
[Ministry of Works]

669
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,630
[Office]

670
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,510
Appointed Emperor, I hold admiration to the former emperor.

671
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,710
Now worrying about the future of the Xiao's military affairs,

672
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,950
and the morale of the Three Armies,

673
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,590
I'm to rebuild the Fengjiang Tower.

674
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,230
Thus this message is sent

675
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,380
to appoint the Minister of Works, Situ Qing as General Architect.

676
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,350
Within seven days since this imperial edict is received,

677
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,680
[Imperial Edict]

678
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,190
the repairing, expanding and building projects

679
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,610
[Office]

680
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,710
shall be completed.

681
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,590
No delay is allowed. That's all!

682
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,070
I, Situ Qing, accept the order and thank His Majesty.

683
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,830
The Fengjiang Tower?

684
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,230
What's it for?

685
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,500
Ask Wang Sheng about this. He knows it.

686
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,910
The soldiers of the Xiao who are going to war

687
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,510
will be examined by the Emperor at the tower.

688
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,390
When they return in triumph,

689
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,710
they will be rewarded at the tower.

690
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,710
So the tower

691
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,670
means a lot to every soldier.

692
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,710
So,

693
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,590
His Majesty is going to fight against the Northern Zhou?

694
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,030
Then Her Highness doesn't have to get married there?

695
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,510
The war will not start for the time being.

696
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,060
Even if the Tower is built,

697
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,910
we still need to train soldiers for a long time,

698
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,150
but Her Highness's marriage can't be delayed for so long.

699
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,540
But since His Majesty has made up his mind,

700
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,110
I believe in the future

701
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,870
we'll have a stronger military force.

702
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,070
Nothing else.

703
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,430
It's just for not being so passive when again meeting this kind of thing.

704
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,710
Wang Sheng, I still don’t understand.

705
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,230
The Xiao has been prosperous under His Majesty's reign.

706
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,030
It's even better than before.

707
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,630
Is the Northern Zhou's military strength

708
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,190
really much better than us?

709
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,230
Since our former emperor passed away,

710
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,460
we've put focus on developing culture and economy.

711
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,710
And military affairs have thus been ignored.

712
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,550
But the Northern Zhou is a country of martial arts,

713
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,620
having built powerful military strength.

714
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,630
Even during the reign of the former emperor, they wouldn't give in.

715
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,550
And our military strength

716
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,750
has indeed been greatly exceeded.

717
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,070
If the Northern Zhou invades us now,

718
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,910
I'm afraid it will be hard for us to defeat them.

719
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,630
It seems that Her Highness

720
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,510
does have no choice this time.

721
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,710
His Majesty ordered the Ministry of Works to rebuild the tower

722
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,190
and get it expanded.

723
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,230
In order to leave no regret,

724
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,030
Her Highness asked to participate in the construction.

725
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,350
This is also her last wish

726
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,710
before she gets married to the Northern Zhou.

727
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,390
Since it's construction work,

728
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,230
can Her Highness do it together with the Wood Feather House?

729
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,350
You still think about making money at this time?

730
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,950
You misunderstood me.

731
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,710
Luo,

732
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,910
can you take me to Her Highness?

733
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,700
But Her Highness said

734
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,710
she didn't want to see Architect Li again.

735
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,630
Luo.

736
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,070
Although she said that,

737
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,550
she didn't really mean that.

738
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,390
There must be some untold words

739
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,710
and unexpressed feelings

740
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,670
between them.

741
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,710
You said Her Highness wanted no regrets.

742
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,870
I think this is the last chance.

743
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,470
I have an idea. Follow me.

744
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,030
I don't know if this is right or wrong.

745
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,230
It's said that the royal family is ruthless.

746
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,350
Now I've witnessed it.

747
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,260
Official!

748
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,460
You have to be careful about what you said.

749
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,270
What am I afraid of?

750
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,390
After Master and Luo left,

751
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,110
my life has been without any hope.

752
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,550
Your affection for Her Highness

753
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,110
is so touching

754
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,670
that heaven and earth can witness it.

755
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,350
Although I have deep affection for Master,

756
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,710
but that's not the kind of affection between lovers.

757
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,710
I couldn't see it clearly before,

758
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,110
but now I can.

759
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,510
Yes.

760
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,910
The person I like is Luo.

761
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,710
I don’t want to lie to myself anymore.

762
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,910
I've lied enough to myself before.

763
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,270
The person I like is Luo.

764
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,910
Not only that,

765
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,350
I’ll also marry Luo in the future.

766
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,230
Good! Official,

767
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,710
I admire you.

768
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,430
Luo is a very good girl.

769
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,830
You must treat Luo well in the future.

770
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,390
Don’t worry.

771
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,550
Even if the ocean goes dry, the rock crumbles, and the whole world falls apart,

772
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,470
I will never let Luo down.

773
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,070
Official!

774
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,750
Love is a matter between two people.

775
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,270
You haven’t asked about Luo's opinion.

776
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,510
Luo,

777
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,750
do you like Official Meng?

778
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,350
I...

779
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,870
-Luo Ye, what do you mean? -Yes.

780
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,750
I like Mr. Meng.

781
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,390
Luo, what did you say?

782
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,470
Say it again.

783
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,350
Official?

784
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,710
You're not deaf.

785
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,350
Why did you ask Luo to say it again?

786
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,380
She will get shy.

787
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,990
Last time...

788
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,230
Stop talking.

789
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,150
Let’s talk about it later.

790
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,270
Okay. I shall listen to you.

791
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,830
Miss Zhao came here

792
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,510
for Li Qingfeng again?

793
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,030
This time, it’s really not for him,

794
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,750
but for all of us.

795
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,230
Miss Chen, think about it.

796
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,670
We've been together for so long.

797
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,230
It's true that your suffering

798
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,190
can't be escaped,

799
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,230
but since we've known each other,

800
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,230
we shouldn't leave any regret.

801
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,910
Just consider it as a perfect ending

802
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,190
for our friendship.

803
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,110
What do you think?

804
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,190
Thanks for your kindness.

805
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,190
On this thing,

806
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,950
you have my words.

807
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,860
Wood Feather House will participate in the construction of the Fengjiang Tower.

808
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,830
Really?

809
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,380
But

810
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,270
there's one condition.

811
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,470
In the future,

812
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,230
please take care of Li Qingfeng.

813
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,270
What do you mean?

814
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,420
You know I like Li Qingfeng.

815
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,950
I also know you like him.

816
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,710
Since I'll soon be married to the Northern Zhou far away from here,

817
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,950
I hope I can help you two get together.
