[Episode 23]

4
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,630
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,580
Rise.

6
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,270
I think you've all heard that.

8
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,430
The princess will set off two days later.

9
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,750
Give me an idea.

10
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,670
The craftsmen who could make the super bow

11
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,669
were all killed on the way to Kaifeng.

12
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,750
What do you think

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,310
we should do?

14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,990
Your Majesty, are you going to

15
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
send the design drawing again?

16
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,990
Otherwise, why did I come to you?

17
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,870
I'm willing to set for Kaifeng immediately

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,150
with all staff in Wood Feather House

19
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,870
to make the super bows and defend the country.

20
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,110
That’s what I’m waiting for.

21
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,070
Luo, go get ready.

22
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,790
But what about the princess?

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,190
If she doesn't leave in two days,

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,150
the Northern Zhou will not give up that easily.

25
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,870
Before we reach Kaifeng,

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,070
the situation may become more tricky.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,390
Since Your Majesty decided to send us to Kaifeng,

28
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,230
Your Majesty must have made a plan in mind.

29
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,430
Li Qingfeng,

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,990
you are indeed exceptionally smart.

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,670
So what's the plan?

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,070
Li Qingfeng, don't keep us guessing.

33
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,829
Tell us.

34
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,750
Sir,

35
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,270
do you remember

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,830
the plan you told me before?

37
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,310
My plan?

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,230
To take the princess away by force.

39
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,270
Now I remember.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,630
So this is what you mean, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,470
Go. Go to take her.

42
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,910
Take the bride away?

43
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,310
Wang Sheng, listen up.

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,910
Yes.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,110
I order you to follow Li Qingfeng

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,750
to leave the city together,

47
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,350
and secretly prepare an ambush in the Northern Zhou's escorting procession,

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,110
to save the princess.

49
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,190
Then you must escort the princess

50
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,150
and people of Wood Feather House

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
to Kaifeng city.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,829
Without fail.

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,110
This plan is feasible.

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,260
It seems good.

56
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,670
We should have decided it earlier.

57
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,390
I didn't expect His Majesty and I have the same idea.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,670
This trip is dangerous.

59
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,590
Miss Zhao, you have business and family concerns.

60
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,030
You'd better stay in Lin'an

61
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,910
and wait for our successful return.

62
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,750
No way.

63
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,350
I must go.

64
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,910
It is different from last time.

65
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,470
This time,

66
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,990
we have cut off all means of retreat.

67
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,390
It concerns Miss Chen's fate,

68
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,390
Wood Feather's fate,

69
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,779
and even your fate.

70
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,070
As a member of Wood Feather House

71
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,510
and your friend,

72
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,500
I must go.

73
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,110
But Mr. Zhao...

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,020
I will explain it to my father.

75
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,340
Don't worry.

76
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,300
Niaoniao, don't worry.

77
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,750
I will protect you.

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,310
With you by my side,

79
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,310
I'm not afraid to go

80
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,630
anywhere dangerous.

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,590
Luo, you…

82
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,950
I’ll leave you alone.

83
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,150
I’m leaving.

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,030
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,190
Pretty good.

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,030
Sir.

87
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,190
You really came at the right time.

88
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm sorry this time.

89
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,070
I owe you a favor.

90
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,270
I don't need your favor.

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,990
Come on.

92
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,070
I'm talking about

93
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,270
your romantic opportunity to be alone with Miss Han.

94
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,710
Sir, what brings you here?

95
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,870
I have to go home.

96
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,670
If I don't come back in two hours,

97
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,910
come to my aid at the back door of my mansion.

98
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,550
Understand?

99
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,350
Got it.

100
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,470
Sir,

101
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,070
you should talk to your parents

102
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
in a serious way.

103
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,630
How can I not understand this?

104
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,030
Don't worry.

105
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,870
Just do as I say.

106
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,550
I know what to do with the rest.

107
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,470
Yining, do you have to go?

108
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,950
Yes.

109
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,870
Yining,

110
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,670
you are my only,

111
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,030
my only precious daughter.

112
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,909
What you are going to do

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,150
is like killing me.

114
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,150
Dad, you know that.

115
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,590
Fine.

116
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,830
I can't say that I allow you to go.

117
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,310
I only hope you to come back safely.

118
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,310
Don't say anything.

119
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,030
My dear daughter,

120
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,750
I don't care about anything in my life.

121
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,750
However,

122
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,470
the only one I can't let go

123
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,990
is you, my daughter.

124
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,990
Dad.

125
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,590
I promise you

126
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,270
I will come back safely.

127
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,950
Get up, my dear.

128
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,190
You must come back safely.

129
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,260
Come back safely.

130
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,350
Yuanxu,

131
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,310
you fetched us here all of a sudden.

132
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,030
I think you may have something important to tell me.

133
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,550
Mon and Dad,

134
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,060
have some tea.

135
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,110
There's no reason for you to show us excessive attention.

136
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,310
Tell me. What's the matter?

137
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,620
Have you and Luo decided

138
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,550
to get married?

139
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,990
No, no.

140
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,020
Luo.

141
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,390
Luo is going to the Northern Zhou.

142
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,270
Don't mention it.

143
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,630
I'm sad enough as it is.

144
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,110
Right.

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,990
According to the plan,

146
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,950
Princess Zhaohe will set off two days later.

147
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,230
That’s right.

148
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,670
Poor kid.

149
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,390
But Yuanxu,

150
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,780
don't be sad.

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,350
I will find a better girl

152
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,790
for you.

153
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,150
What are you talking about, Mom?

154
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,670
Don't you like Luo very much?

155
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,030
No other girl in the world

156
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,580
is better than Luo.

157
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,710
I know you are infatuated with her.

158
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,870
But you have to

159
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,430
move on, right?

160
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,789
Mom, don't worry about this.

161
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,030
He's right.

162
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,710
Tell us.

163
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,750
Why did you call us here?

164
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,549
Right. Why?

165
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,630
I have to inform you that

166
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,350
I am going to Kaifeng.

167
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,750
OK. Kaifeng.

168
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,750
Where did you say?

169
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,750
Dad, calm down.

170
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,980
Are you kidding?

171
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,870
This time, we just followed...

172
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,110
Follow? Follow who?

173
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,110
I think you're crazy.

174
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,270
Anyway, we're not trying to provoke the Northern Zhou.

175
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,230
Everything will be fine.

176
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,510
What do you mean by it?

177
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,510
You think I don't know that?

178
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,030
A few days ago,

179
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,670
the arrow-making craftsmen of the Ministry of War

180
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,070
were killed by secret agents from the Northern Zhou

181
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,670
just on their way to Kaifeng.

182
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,510
Aren't you now going to Kaifeng

183
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,070
for the same thing?

184
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,830
People of the Arrow-making House were officials,

185
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,060
so the secret agents from Northern Zhou would come.

186
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,990
But we are just a few craftsmen.

187
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,870
Besides, apart from the Arrow-making House,

188
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,230
Wood Feather House is the only one

189
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,710
that is able to make super bows.

190
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,590
Who else can go if we don't go?

191
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,390
But you

192
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,270
can't risk your life.

193
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,470
What will risk your life?

194
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,950
What are you two talking about?

195
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,590
What's going on?

196
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,830
Mom, Dad will tell you the details.

197
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,030
Today I came home to inform you that

198
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,510
I will come back from Kaifeng

199
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,990
in two months at best.

200
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,910
At worst,

201
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,830
I don't know how long it will take.

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,620
Anyway, don't worry about me.

203
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,470
No way.

204
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,390
I said I came to inform you,

205
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,350
not asking for permission.

206
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,030
What if you happen to meet the secret agents

207
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,910
of the Northern Zhou?

208
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,630
If we meet them,

209
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,990
we will be sure to die.

210
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,910
No way. I won't allow it either.

211
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,470
Dad, Mom, why can't you expect something good?

212
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,350
I've been blessed since I was young.

213
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,670
I will be fine.

214
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,110
My kid, don't scare me.

215
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,470
Just stay in Lin'an.

216
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,990
And leave alone Wood Feather House.

217
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,990
Mom. Dad.

218
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,950
I'm really not a good son.

219
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,870
In the past,

220
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,670
I was the most merry-making idler in Lin'an.

221
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,270
Until I entered Wood Feather,

222
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,750
and followed the princess, my master,

223
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,510
I gradually became serious about life.

224
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,230
Now I want to do something good

225
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,380
to the country and the people.

226
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,870
Please allow me.

227
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,110
It's also a good thing to build houses.

228
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,230
You don't have to risk your life.

229
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,830
Your dad is right.

230
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,940
But if Lin'an is no longer Lin'an,

231
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,350
Xiao Dynasty no longer exists,

232
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,990
and people become homeless,

233
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,110
whom can we build houses for?

234
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,070
But it's not up to us

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,060
whether Xiao Dynasty continues to exist.

236
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,870
Dad,

237
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,750
you always wanted me to get admission

238
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,830
and become an official.

239
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,670
I always dreamed of being a hero

240
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,750
to uphold the justice.

241
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,190
Actually, I'm not that capable.

242
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,710
I can't be

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,750
either an official or a hero.

244
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,550
I have let you down.

245
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,750
It may be that Mom often burns incense

246
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,750
to pray for me before gods.

247
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,390
Even if I didn't become an official,

248
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,230
I've understood the meaning of being loyal to the country and the people.

249
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,550
Dad, I promise you

250
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,340
that I will be back safe and sound after two months.

251
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,510
In the future,

252
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,430
I’ll be the son who makes you proud.

253
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,750
Mom, take it as my trip to Kaifeng

254
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,510
to bring back

255
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,700
your daughter-in-law Luo.

256
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,190
This is my only chance.

257
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,630
I won't let it go.

258
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,990
Please forgive your unfilial son.

Sir, why are you in such a good mood?

261

He is certainly very happy

262
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,270
to have his family's approval.

263
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,910
This will be my first time to take someone else's bride,

264
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,110
and the bride is my master.

265
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,510
I can not only bring back my master

but also defeat that bastard, He Zhigu.

267

How can I not be in a good mood?

268
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,110
Right.

269
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,750
Taking the bride on imperial orders,

270
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,310
I'm afraid, is the only chance in the world.

Miss Zhao is here.

272
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,310
Of course I should be here.

I was told you’re going to Kaifeng.

a troop of our soldiers was killed outside the city.

299
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,790
You must be careful this time.

The ministers who advocate peace were against His Majesty,

kneeling down in front of the palace

and unwilling to get up.

And then?

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,870

he asked me

378
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,230
to take good care of you

379
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,950
to protect your childish heart all your life.

380
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,550
I

381
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,350
feel guilty for Father.

382
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,670
I know very well

383
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,750
your love for me.

384
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,990
But in the end,

385
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,310
I had to grow up.

386
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,950
Langyue.

387
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,150
Do you think

388
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,350
I am a good emperor?

389
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,630
I've known two good emperors.

390
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,790
One is my father,

391
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,780
and the other is my brother.

392
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,220
But I have to send my own sister

393
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,110
to the barbarian Northern Zhou,

394
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,190
making her not only suffer from homesickness,

395
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,070
but also

396
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,030
become the meat on the enemy's chopping block.

397
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,230
But Brother,

398
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,470
it's for the prosperity of Xiao Dynasty.

399
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,790
That's what a good emperor should do.

400
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,230
But Li Qingfeng

401
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,870
would certainly not think so.

402
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,790
Why did you mention him?

403
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,790
Because he is the one you care about.

404
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,870
I know

405
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,910
what happened between you two.

406
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,110
When he came to me with the drawing of super bow,

407
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,670
I saw in his eyes

408
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,230
the same thing as that in your eyes.

409
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,110
He also begged me

410
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,660
to keep you here.

411
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,990
Are you sure

412
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,430
not to see him again?

413
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,150
Rest early.

414
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,990
If I see him again,

415
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,910
I’m afraid, even if I die,

416
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,550
I won’t leave him any more.

417
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,870
Mom, we are back.

418
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,310
Greetings, Mrs. Meng.

419
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,910
Don't stand on ceremony, Luo.

420
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,670
Sir,

421
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,150
can I talk to Mrs. Meng alone?

422
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,030
Why do you have to avoid me?

423
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,150
It's nothing to worry about.

424
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,790
But there's something

425
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,990
I can't speak in front of you.

426
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,910
Please wait for me at the door.

427
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,710
OK?

428
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,710
Just leave as she says.

429
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,390
OK.

430
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,310
Luo, if you have anything to say,

431
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,630
come and sit down.

432
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,950
Mrs. Meng,

433
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,270
he must have told you.

434
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,710
Tomorrow I will

435
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,110
accompany the princess to the Northern Zhou.

436
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,110
I know.

437
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,390
But what do you mean?

438
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,380
I have been wearing it for so long.

439
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,550
It’s God’s gift

440
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,710
and my blessing.

441
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,710
Now

442
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,670
it's time to return it to its owner.

443
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,910
Since Yuanxu gave it to you,

444
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,310
he's sure to want you to his wife.

445
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm also sure that you should be my daughter-in-law.

446
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,190
But why are you leaving?

447
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,310
Are you

448
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,630
not willing to accept us?

449
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,910
I am willing to.

450
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,790
Nothing can make me more willing than that.

451
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,550
But I clearly know

452
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,510
I can't be your daughter-in-law.

453
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,550
Please

454
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,910
find a good match for him.

455
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,470
There must be someone

456
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,030
who is more suitable to wear the bracelet than me.

457
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,150
Luo.

458
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,910
Do you know how much Yuanxu loves you?

459
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,030
I know.

460
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,030
He treats me very well.

461
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,790
But I owe the princess a debt of gratitude.

462
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,630
How can I let the princess

463
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,550
face the ferocity of foreign country alone?

464
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,510
Therefore,

465
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,510
I can only repay

466
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,630
his love in the next life.

467
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,310
I understand your feelings as master and maid.

468
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,470
But I know Yuanxu well.

469
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,910
He may look careless,

470
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,270
but once he is determined,

471
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,030
he will devote everything to that person.

472
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,150
If you leave,

473
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,990
he will be overwhelmed with sorrow.

474
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,990
Please help him forget me.

475
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,550
Take a look.

476
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,300
How is it?

477
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,310
It's utterly natural,

478
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,670
poetic imagery beauty.

479
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,990
I don't know if you're praising me

480
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,190
or yourself.

481
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,780
Most importantly,

482
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,950
this painting

483
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,670
was drawn by us together.

484
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,960

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,950

Your Highness, I deserve to die.

What happened?

554
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,150
I failed to keep an eye on Luo.

555
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,190
Luo is missing.

556
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,230
Luo is missing?

557
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,590
Have you searched everywhere?

558
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,670
I've searched every place

559
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,950
but still can't find her.

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,590
Silly Luo.

561
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,700
Where did you hide?

562
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,100
Your Highness.

563
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,270

But even if I die here today,

I'll go north with you.

I'm silly.

Even if the sun were to rise in the west,

I'll go to the Northern Zhou with you.

I granted a marriage between the two states of Xiao and Zhou.

The couple are destined to be together.

598
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,710
Since Xiao and Zhou unite by marriage,

599
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,150
I confer a title of Princess Nanping on Princess Zhaohe,

The number doesn't matter.

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,390
I think I need to make it clear to you.

669
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,670

But affection

673
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,590
is the only requirement for me to choose a husband.

I know you like me.

675
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,790
Just like I liked Li Qingfeng before.

But he never liked me.

677
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,430
And I

678
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,430
have never liked you.

Mr. Zhang,

680
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,030
we can't force our feelings.

681
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,380
I'm a straightforward person.

682
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,910
I hope you can forgive me.

683
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,340
So go back.

689
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,590
If

690
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,180
one of your seven brothers dares to say that,

691
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,790
I will scold him severely.

692
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,030
But Yining, you said it.

693
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,990
It's quite another matter.

694
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:16,070
But you must tell me the truth.

695
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,190
You want to borrow so much money from me.

696
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,590
What for?

697
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,910
Invest Wood Feather House.

698
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,710
What a joke!

699
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,910
Such a small team of craftsmen.

700
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,390
If you just invest it,

701
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,830
how can you spend so much money?

702
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,150
Go to Kaifeng to make super bows

703
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,350
and rebuild the city defense.

704
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,390
What did I say?

705
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,380
What did I say?

706
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,870
I knew it.

707
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,070
Last time,

708
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,030
you risked your own safety

709
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,220
and went to Kaifeng.

710
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,870
Are you going to bet

711
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,550
the whole Zhao family's life this time?

712
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,550
Yining, if you were me,

713
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,510
what will you do?

714
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,790
Alright.

715
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,750
Listen to me.

716
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,350
Don't mention it again.

717
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,750
I've heard about it.

718
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,910
Mr. Sun, the Minister of Revenue,

719
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,870
openly opposed the imperial edict in the court.

720
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,510
His purpose was not to appropriate the funds.

721
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,340
Think about it.

722
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,070
Even the emperor couldn't do this.

723
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,940
Why should our Zhao family do it?

724
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,590
Zhao family won't be involved.

725
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,230
Zhao family won't be involved?

726
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,270
If we do this,

727
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,550
our family is involved.

728
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,710
Think about it.

729
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,430
How important it is to rebuild the city defense.

730
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,510
If people with evil intentions investigate it,

731
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,430
they will know

732
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,750
Wood Feather House is invested by our Zhao family.

733
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,430
Can you say

734
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,390
it has nothing to do with our family?

735
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,150
Isn't it a kind of involvement?

736
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,590
Even if we're involved,

737
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,910
is this something to be ashamed of?

738
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,590
It's not something to be ashamed of.

739
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,830
It's something to get beheaded.
