00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,280
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,430
Xu Qian is from Northern Zhou.

5
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,750
Northern Zhou?

6
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,470
This is what I ignored.

7
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,710
The characters on the bamboo table

8
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,110
looked like they were written with great force

9
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,310
and carelessly.

10
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,340
It was definitely not carved by Miss Zhang.

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,660
If it was a Han person who wrote it,

12
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,590
the strokes wouldn't have been like that.

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,750
The angle of the knife shows that it was not written with the right hand,

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,940
but the left hand.

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,630
And the knife found in Xu Qian's mansion

16
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,230
is a typical Northern Zhou short knife.

17
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,070
The Northern Zhou people hold a long knife with the right hand,

18
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,230
and a short knife with the left hand.

19
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:05,990
So,

20
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,620
for effortless things like writing,

21
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,150
they usually use their left hand.

22
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,790
So that's what you were thinking last night?

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,470
I thought it was an urgent matter.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,710
Is it really worth it

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,670
to wake us up so early in the morning for this?

26
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,190
I see.

27
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,950
The most beautiful house according to Miss Zhang

28
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,390
is the style of Northern Zhou architecture.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,110
She and Xu Qian were deeply in love.

30
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,670
During this period,

31
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,350
Xu Qianji might have taken her to Northern Zhou.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,870
Why didn't Mr. Zhang mention it before?

33
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,870
Because the Zhang family really cares about its reputation.

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,870
They didn't want to tell outsiders

35
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,110
about Miss Zhang's eloping.

36
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,950
Besides, the person she loves

37
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,670
is from Northern Zhou.

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,110
Even if we asked them,

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,670
they wouldn't admit it anyway.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,220
Is she really

41
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,270
so obsessed with Northern Zhou architecture?

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,590
Northern Zhou architecture?

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,070
Who has ever seen it before?

44
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,870
Although I'm a martial artist,

45
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,670
I've never been to Northern Zhou.

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,910
I've only heard that those from Northern Zhou are good at riding horses.

47
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,580
They're nomadic people

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,670
and live on grasslands.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,630
They usually stay in yurts.

50
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,350
As for what exactly yurts look like,

51
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,670
I have no idea.

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,990
We can’t just sit here and do nothing.

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,430
Since you have found an important clue, Qingfeng,

54
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,470
I'll go to the street

55
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,350
to see if anyone knows people from Northern Zhou.

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,110
As long as we find Northern Zhou people to help us,

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,390
we can build the yurt.

58
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,630
Now the two states are at odds

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,670
and spies are everywhere.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,430
It's not easy

61
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,230
to find Northern Zhou people on the street.

62
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,910
We have to find a way.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,110
If you know friends from Northern Zhou,

64
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,750
bring them to Wood Feather House

65
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
so that Mr. Luo doesn't have to look for them.

66
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,670
Miss Chen,

67
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,630
tell me

68
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,190
about what you know of the Northern Zhou yurt.

69
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,590
The nomadic people don't have a fixed place to live.

70
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,110
They move on horses all the time.

71
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,230
That's why they prefer yurts.

72
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,790
The style of yurts is very different from the residence in Jiangnan and Central Plain.

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,019
Look.

74
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,220
No stone wall and no wood celing.

75
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,269
Only yurts are used to provide protection from wind and rain

76
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,750
so that they're ready to move at any time.

77
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,990
Inside a yurt,

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,310
how big is the space?

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,270
How many pillars are there?

80
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,070
What's its floor made of?

81
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,740
How do I know that?

82
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,590
I just heard it from my brother.

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,950
Does your brother know how to build a yurt?

84
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,350
Why?

85
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,470
If he knows the details,

86
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,870
I'd like to visit your family

87
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,950
and talk to your brother.

88
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,750
Well...

89
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,470
I don't think you can.

90
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Why?

91
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,470
My brother doesn't live in the family mansion.

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,310
Is it because he's not in the house

93
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,550
or you don't want me to go there again?

94
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,870
What do you mean?

95
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,980
Li Qingfeng, just say it.

96
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,270
I don’t want to talk about it.

97
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,470
All I want now is to know how to build a Northern Zhou yurt.

98
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,630
What do you mean?

99
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,270
Are you suspecting me?

100
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,030
You suspect that I’m engaged with Mr. He,

101
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,350
so you want to confirm it with my brother.

102
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,110
You'd rather believe him

103
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,270
than me.

104
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,390
Do you trust me then?

105
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,950
If you trust me,

106
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,190
you won't fend off my questions.

107
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,950
If you trust me,

108
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,670
you wouldn't have

109
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,350
kept anything about your family from me.

110
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,990
Li Qingfeng.

111
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,630
Master, Li Qingfeng.

112
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,110
Somebody from Northern Zhou is here.

113
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,710
We're so lucky.

114
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,710
As soon as we went out to look for the Northern Zhou people,

115
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,150
we met Mr. He who came to visit us.

116
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,260
He brought milk wine

117
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,670
and dried beef.

118
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,150
He is actually from Northern Zhou.

119
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,310
Is Mr. He your friend?

120
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,950
To put it more precisely,

121
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,350
he's a friend of Miss Chen.

122
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,350
Yes, he's my friend.

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,430
I'm here to bring some specialties

124
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,150
from my hometown to Miss Chen.

125
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,550
Miss Chen, since you need my help,

126
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,590
why didn't you tell me earlier?

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,430
I will do my best to help.

128
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,470
It's very kind of you.

129
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,100
But we don't want to bother you

130
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,590
about the building of the yurt.

131
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,430
Please do bother me.

132
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,590
Mr. He, we need your help.

133
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,870
Will you help me?

134
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,870
It's my honor

135
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,150
to be at your service, Miss Chen.

136
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,790
He!

137
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,740
Do all Northern Zhou people

138
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,790
stare at girls like you do?

139
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,830
Please forgive me.

140
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,830
Miss Chen is so beautiful

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,270
that I couldn't take my eyes off her.

142
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,430
My apologies.

143
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,870
You think I'm beautiful?

144
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,550
Of course you are.

145
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,100
Your stunning beauty

146
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,670
amazed me when we first met.

147
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,350
Mr. He,

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,830
since you promise to help,

149
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,150
let's get to the point.

150
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,830
Please tell us how to build a yurt.

151
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,310
Okay.

152
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,470
But I have a request.

153
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,670
I hope Miss Chen

154
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,070
will be in charge of the draft.

155
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,940
You don't have to worry about

156
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,190
the division of work in Wood Feather House.

157
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,510
I think you didn't hear me clearly.

158
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,590
I said

159
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,550
I'll only help

160
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,180
if Miss Chen is in charge of the draft.

161
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,790
Understand?

162
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Don't worry, Mr. He.

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,030
I'll do the draft.

164
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,230
OK.

165
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,470
Are you free now?

166
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,030
I still have things to attend to today.

167
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,190
I'll come back tomorrow, OK?

168
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,830
OK, deal.

169
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,110
See you tomorrow.

170
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,780
[Wood Feather Pavilion]

171
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,350
Mr. Li.

172
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,070
Luo.

173
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,070
My lady said she couldn’t finish the food alone,

174
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,670
so she asked me to share it with you.

175
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,270
Thank you.

176
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,630
Thank you.

177
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,670
I thought you would refuse.

178
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,710
Why would I?

179
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,510
My lady is not interested in Mr. He at all.

180
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,030
I can tell that

181
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,030
she’s just mad at you.

182
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,510
Thank you, Luo.

183
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,590
Well,

184
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,390
another thing.

185
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,350
Go ahead.

186
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,430
My lady is very upset.

187
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,470
As a man,

188
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,300
maybe you should try to

189
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,990
have a better understanding of women.

190
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,870
Did your lady tell you to say that?

191
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:02,950
No, no, no.

192
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,100
I said it

193
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,030
because I hate to see

194
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,110
my lady be so depressed.

195
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,190
I feel sorry for her.

196
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,830
Sorry for making you worry, Luo.

197
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,550
Sorry.

198
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,510
Mr. Li, don't say sorry.

199
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,870
I’m off.

200
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,950
Luo.

201
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,590
Master.

202
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,490
[Thorough survey of curves and lines]

203
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,590
What are you doing?

204
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,110
My lady asked me

205
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,670
to share with everyone the food from Northern Zhou.

206
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,310
I'm going to take yours.

207
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,310
What's so good about food in Northern Zhou?

208
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,150
I need to ask you something very serious.

209
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,270
Please go ahead.

210
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:37,870
Do you think

211
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,910
He Zhigu has a crush on Master?

212
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,870
I'm afraid

213
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,110
everybody can clearly see that.

214
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,110
How dare that Northern Zhou barbarian

215
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,950
try to hit on our Princess?

216
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,550
Should I send some people to warn him

217
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,830
and tell him to behave?

218
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,230
It's all in your head, sir.

219
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,750
There must be plenty of men out there

220
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,460
who find my lady

221
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,590
attractive.

222
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,670
How can we blame them?

223
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,310
What matters is who she likes.

224
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,710
That makes sense.

225
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,070
But look at Li Qingfeng.

226
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,750
He's an idiot.

227
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,510
He should have made it clear that he's the one that Master likes.

228
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,270
Are you taking his side now?

229
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,990
No, I'm not.

230
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,070
I just think

231
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,460
Li Qingfeng

232
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,990
is better than He Zhigu.

233
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,990
Don't worry.

234
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,510
My lady will never like somebody like Mr. He.

235
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,940
That’s true.

236
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,590
But I’m afraid that idiot Li Qingfeng

237
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,580
would make himself look bad compared with He Zhigu.

238
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,990
Stop.

239
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,870
Who hasn’t got it?

240
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,990
I’ll help you deliver the food.

241
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,750
Don’t bother.

242
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,630
Be good.

243
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,230
What the hell is this? It's so hard.

244
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,830
It's gonna break my teeth!

245
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,750
What? Are you going to close the door?

246
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,070
We are men.

247
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,870
Why do you have to close the door?

248
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,870
Forget it.

249
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:10,860
What's wrong?

250
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,550
What's wrong?

251
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,310
Can't you tell that He Zhigu

252
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,380
fancies Master?

253
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,350
So what?

254
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,310
I'll give you a chance.

255
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,710
When you finish work here,

256
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,750
I'll bring my kung fu coach

257
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,110
to teach that guy a lesson.

258
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,430
And you'll be very lucky

259
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,550
to be the first one to do it.

260
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,310
What do you think?

261
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,510
How will you teach Mr. He a lesson?

262
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,510
I'll beat him up.

263
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,990
Why don't you just kill him?

264
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,990
Li Qingfeng,

265
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,430
I underestimated you.

266
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,670
But,

267
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,230
that's a terrible idea.

268
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,700
Li Qingfeng, are you kidding me?

269
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,540
I just don’t know

270
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,990
why you have to teach Mr. He a lesson.

271
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,750
Don't play dumb with me.

272
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,030
You know exactly what I'm talking about!

273
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,710
I don't have time for that.

274
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,950
Just ask

275
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,510
someone else.

276
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,430
You are not honest to yourself.

277
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,990
No wonder you always make Master angry.

278
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,470
I see

279
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,580
what happened today.

280
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,630
Although you upset Master,

281
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm happy.

282
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,190
Because now,

283
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,950
Master won't be

284
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,190
fooled by your hypocrisy.

285
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,670
That's good.

286
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,750
When you see me and Miss Chen

287
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,940
work together,

288
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,700
how do you feel?

289
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,030
Why didn't you just ask

290
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,710
how it makes me feel

291
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,470
to see you two

292
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,070
being lovey-dovey together?

293
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,950
To be honest,

294
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,790
I used to think

295
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,630
Master was way out of your league.

296
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,590
So I was furious whenever I saw you and her together.

297
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,470
But then...

298
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,150
Anyway, I'm fine now.

299
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,470
As the saying goes,

300
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,830
distance tests the strength of a horse,

301
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,790
and time reveals the true character of a person.

302
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,230
Let's wait and see.

303
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,590
We're different.

304
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,310
Is Miss Chen the love of your life?

305
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,070
I...

306
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,750
Luo.

307
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,630
Luo!

308
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,830
Luo!

309
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,110
Luo! Luo!

310
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,310
What’s going on?

311
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,870
Mr. He, please.

312
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,150
So this is where you work.

313
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,830
It's where I work with Architect Li.

314
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,500
Do you two work together?

315
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,820
Yes.

316
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,350
In that case,

317
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,310
Mr. Li,

318
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,030
I really envy you.

319
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,310
Don't move.

320
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,990
Mr. Li doesn't like other people to touch his stuff.

321
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,590
But he makes an exception for you, right?

322
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,190
Yes.

323
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,620
That's right.

324
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,670
Mr. He, shall we start now?

325
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,150
Of course.

326
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:06,870
Please.

327
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,180
I'm good at swordsmanship,

328
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,310
but I don't know anything about painting.

329
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,510
Miss Chen, please.

330
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,510
You'll do the draft and I'll describe it.

331
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,550
OK?

332
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,830
Alright. Thank you, Mr. He.

333
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,750
Do you have to observe here?

334
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,790
I'm an architect.

335
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,270
Even though I'm not in charge of the draft,

336
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,150
it's my job to supervise here.

337
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,470
It doesn't matter.

338
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,870
Let's get started.

339
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,550
The Northern Zhou yurt is composed of four parts,

340
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,790
including a door, Hana, Oni and a round skylight.

341
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,650
[The Northern Zhou yurt is composed of]

342
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,470
Besides, there are willow rafters,

343
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,550
leather ropes and mane ropes.

344
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,620
A big yurt is round.

345
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,990
A small one is one and a half zhang in its diameter.

346
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,390
Miss Chen.

347
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,070
This is not right.

348
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,910
Let me help you.

349
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,350
Like this. Look.

350
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,070
It should be like this.

351
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,870
Mr. He.

352
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,470
Li Qingfeng, what are you doing?

353
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,230
Look, now I have to redraw it.

354
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,870
Let me do it.

355
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,150
It doesn't look round now.

356
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,910
Miss Chen, please make another draft.

357
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,550
I'll do it.

358
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,390
It doesn't really matter.

359
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,150
Let me do it.

360
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,350
Mr. Li, it looks like you don't really care about

361
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,790
the accuracy of the draft.

362
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,070
I don’t think it’s necessary for me to stay. Goodbye.

363
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,270
Mr. He.

364
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,830
Wait for me.

365
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,350
Mr. He.

366
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,910
Mr. He, wait for me.

367
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,870
Wait.

368
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,910
Wait.

369
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,550
Miss Chen, I'm willing to help you.

370
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,550
But Architect Li seems to hold grudges against me.

371
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,790
With him here,

372
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,069
I'm afraid the draft can't be completed today.

373
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,030
I know.

374
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,510
That's the way he is.

375
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,349
Just ignore him.

376
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,790
How about we get the paper and ink brush

377
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,790
and go to the meeting hall to finish the draft?

378
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,430
Miss Chen.

379
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,750
To be honest,

380
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,270
I really don't feel comfortable in Wood Feather House.

381
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,430
So you mean...

382
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,790
How about this?

383
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,470
Let's find a quiet place

384
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,230
so that no one will disturb us

385
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,550
and I'll be able to explain the details of the yurt.

386
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,550
What do you think?

387
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,150
Well...

388
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,510
You don't want to?

389
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,910
No, no, no.

390
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,510
I would love to.

391
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,830
Then let's go to Yi Mu Restaurant.

392
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,500
I'll get the tools. Wait for me.

393
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,030
OK.

394
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,630
What are you going to do?

395
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,590
To do the draft at Yi Mu Restaurant.

396
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,430
Why do you have to go there?

397
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,110
It's all your fault!

398
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,670
If you hadn't irritated He Zhigu,

399
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,470
I wouldn't have had to go there.

400
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,620
Don't go.

401
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,750
How can I make the draft if I don't?

402
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,140
How can we build the yurt without a draft?

403
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,950
I don’t think

404
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,310
we can't find another person from Northern Zhou to help us

405
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,270
in Lin'an.

406
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,230
Li Qingfeng,

407
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,830
are you worried about me?

408
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,710
I...

409
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,030
Not at all!

410
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,910
OK. If you don't want me to go,

411
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,710
apologize to me.

412
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,270
Then I'll refuse Mr. He.

413
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,110
Apologize?

414
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,750
Why should I apologize?

415
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,270
What do you think?

416
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,070
I think you should give me an explanation.

417
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,870
OK. Wait for it then.

418
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Mr. He, let’s go.

419
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,510
Here.

420
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,300
Thank you.

421
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,910
Miss Chen, why do you look so upset

422
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,550
all of a sudden?

423
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,990
That's Li Qingfeng’s special talent I guess.

424
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,430
Forget it.

425
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,270
He's ridiculous.

426
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,150
I'll leave him alone.

427
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,550
Let's go.

428
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,640
[Yi Mu Restaurant]

429
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,420
Miss Chen.

430
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
Speaking of Xiao,

431
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,870
there are only two things that attract me the most.

432
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,390
The first thing is the delicious food.

433
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,390
Food here

434
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,630
is so delicious wherever I go.

435
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,110
What's the second one?

436
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,550
The second one is

437
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,790
the beautiful and elegant Jiangnan girls like you, Miss Chen.

438
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,710
Mr. He, you're wrong.

439
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,310
Jiangnan girls are indeed beautiful and elegant.

440
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,550
But

441
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,950
I'm not one of those girls.

442
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,220
My personality

443
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,390
is more like men.

444
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,950
Miss Chen, your personality

445
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,790
is a combination of the gentleness of Jiangnan

446
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,390
and the roughness of Northern Zhou.

447
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,460
So I think

448
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,190
you're supposed to live in Northern Zhou.

449
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,030
I don't think so.

450
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,710
This place is called Yi Mu Restaurant.

451
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,270
It's quiet and elegant.

452
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,870
I will remember this place.

453
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,110
This is where our first date takes place.

454
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,030
It means a lot to me.

455
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,780
It means nothing...

456
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,870
Miss Chen...

457
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,430
Don't get me wrong.

458
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,230
I was talking about Li Qingfeng.

459
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,430
You mean...

460
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,630
Well,

461
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,710
Li Qingfeng brought me here before.

462
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,510
Interesting.

463
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,910
I thought Mr. Li was talented,

464
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,470
but didn't know how to enjoy life.

465
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,310
I didn't expect him to come here at leisure.

466
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,030
At leisure...

467
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,740
When he

468
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,710
is alone,

469
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,110
he enjoys himself by playing instruments, chess, doing calligraphy, painting, reciting poetry, and drinking wine and tea.

470
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,990
But when he's with other people,

471
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,150
he's always a boring guy.

472
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,470
Selfish.

473
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,790
-Do you think I... -Besides,

474
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,710
he's arrogant.

475
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,790
and infuriating.

476
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,910
When he upset people,

477
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,310
he blames others first.

478
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,030
That's ridiculous, right?

479
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,630
Yes.

480
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,100
By the way,

481
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,190
I drew a painting with him.

482
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,030
Please tell me who draws better.

483
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,870
You...Miss Chen.

484
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,630
Sit down.

485
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,430
Let's make the draft.

486
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,470
I almost forgot.

487
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,950
OK. Let's do it.

488
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,430
Don't worry.

489
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,390
I don't know Miss Chen as well as you do,

490
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,620
but I'm sure

491
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,430
she just wants to do the job well.

492
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,910
I know.

493
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,190
But you don't look like you know.

494
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,510
Sometimes you

495
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,670
don't mince your words and upset other people.

496
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,870
But sometimes,

497
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,790
you prefer to keep to yourself.

498
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,870
Miss Zhao,

499
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,950
can I ask you a somewhat offensive question?

500
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,990
This is not your style.

501
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,790
Go ahead.

502
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,630
On the day I first visited your family‘s mansion,

503
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,550
you didn't even know me.

504
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,940
Why did you like me?

505
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,790
There's a difference between liking someone

506
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,990
and understanding someone.

507
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,510
It takes time to understand another person.

508
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,710
But I like you

509
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,030
because I just knew you were the one the moment I saw you.

510
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,670
That feeling

511
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,190
is very precious.

512
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,670
What if

513
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,670
two people are in love,

514
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,390
but one of them is hiding something from the other?

515
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,990
What should be done in that case?

516
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,220
If it's for the sake of their relationship,

517
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,950
I don't think that's an inappropriate thing to do.

518
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,030
Besides,

519
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,750
truth will come to light sooner or later.

520
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,550
Nothing

521
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,260
can be hidden forever.

522
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,270
You'll know the truth eventually.

523
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,670
Is Miss Chen hiding something from you?

524
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,430
No.

525
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,110
I don't think so, either.

526
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,270
Miss Chen is also very straightforward.

527
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,190
On the contrary, you tend to keep to yourself

528
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,910
and it's more likely that you hide things from her.

529
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,380
Miss Zhao.

530
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,270
Miss Chen, we were talking about you.

531
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,540
It must be something bad.

532
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,630
You two

533
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,670
are exactly the same.

534
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,470
OK, I won't bother you.

535
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,110
I’m off.

536
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,550
By the way,

537
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,750
I've never seen a Northern Zhou yurt.

538
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,300
If you don't mind,

539
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,230
take me with you when you're at work.

540
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,790
No problem, Miss Zhao.

541
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,790
OK.

542
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,310
Goodbye.

543
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,390
What?

544
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,790
Are you waiting for me?

545
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,390
I'm waiting for the draft.

546
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,540
Come and have a look.

547
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,710
My draft is very detailed.

548
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:44,790
Leave it here.

549
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,230
What?

550
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,780
You demanded supervision during the day.

551
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,710
Now

552
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,230
I've finished the draft,

553
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,670
but you don't even want to have a look!

554
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,070
This is a draft that you and Mr. He

555
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,070
spent a whole day on.

556
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,870
It must be very detailed.

557
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,470
I don't need to see it.

558
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,070
Somebody's jealous here, huh?

559
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,020
I can feel it in the air.

560
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,110
Why are you staring at me?

561
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,750
You keep staring at me.

562
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,950
Are you trying to eat me?

563
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,470
What are you doing?

564
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,630
Did you do anything else

565
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,710
besides making the draft with He Zhigu?

566
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,020
Do you care?

567
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,470
Yes.

568
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,620
Then apologize to me.

569
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,500
Or I won't tell you.

570
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,190
I didn't do anything wrong.

571
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,710
Then go away.

572
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,340
No.

573
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,590
Go away!

574
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,230
How dare you!

575
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,460
You deserve it.

576
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,190
-It's raining. -Right.

577
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,750
Mr. Li.

578
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,070
I'm not sure

579
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,830
whether you can

580
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,070
build the most beautiful house in the world or not.

581
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,430
But

582
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,550
we can have a try.

583
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,230
Fu had a seizure several times after she came back.

584
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,710
We can’t get her worked up again.

585
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,590
If you are not completely sure about it,

586
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,710
forget it.

587
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,350
Mr. Zhang,

588
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,110
I think we should give it a try.

589
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,310
We can’t see Fu

590
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,750
live in hysteria for the rest of her life.

591
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,630
But she can't afford to get worked up again.

592
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,150
Mr. Zhang,

593
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,390
we'll cover the house with curtains.

594
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,270
If the new house

595
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,030
is not the most beautiful one according to her,

596
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,510
then we'll just demolish it.

597
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,310
OK.

598
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,390
But Mr. Li,

599
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,070
I'm curious.

600
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,060
What kind of house are you going to build?

601
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,590
Why there are only pillars without stone bricks?

602
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,990
You'll see.

603
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,350
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

604
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,150
OK. Thank you.

605
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,790
Mr. Zhang.

606
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,620
Miss Zhao.

607
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,070
What are you doing here?

608
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,870
Just for fun.

609
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,190
Since I can't help much with your work,

610
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,070
I’m here to take a look.

611
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,950
I have nothing better to do now.

612
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,870
Are you free to go to my archery room

613
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,990
to see my new bows and arrows?

614
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,190
OK.

615
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,070
Please.

616
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,670
How is it, Miss Zhao?

617
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,590
Is my archery room good?

618
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,070
Did you make this yourself?

619
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,310
Yes.

620
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,590
You let me win on purpose in the hunting field before.

621
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,310
My eyes were following you

622
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,030
and I was distracted.

623
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,910
Follow me?

624
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,670
Yes.

625
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,910
You're very straightforward.

626
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,510
One shouldn’t hesitate

627
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,030
in face of love.

628
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,270
I like you the way you like Architect Li.

629
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,550
Your sincerity

630
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,430
has impressed me a lot.

631
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,070
You know I like Architect Li,

632
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,270
so why did you still say that?

633
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,510
Because I'm in love.

634
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,030
And I want to be honest with you.

635
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,550
In that case,

636
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,470
we're very much alike.

637
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,790
We can be friends.

638
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,340
I’m happy

639
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,790
to be your friend.

640
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,550
Isn't it painful

641
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,990
to only be friends with the one you like?

642
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,150
If I can't even be friends with the girl I like,

643
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,510
it would be even more painful.

644
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,070
I can't believe it's more difficult to build pillars than stacking up stones.

645
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,030
Thank you, guys.

646
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,510
Go to bed early tonight.

647
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,230
Tomorrow's work will be more difficult.

648
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,790
You are exploiting us.

649
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,430
I thought you were going to

650
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,790
find more craftsmen tomorrow.

651
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,070
None of the workers in Lin'an

652
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,950
has done this before.

653
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,910
We need to help them one by one if we hire them.

654
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,630
The more craftsmen, the more tiring the work will be.

655
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,830
Exactly.

656
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,670
I went to the Ministry of Works to register for this work.

657
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,030
Even the Minister

658
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,110
had never seen a yurt draft before.

659
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,590
Well,

660
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
we should thank Miss Chen and Mr. He.

661
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,430
If they hadn't

662
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,060
made the draft so carefully,

663
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,670
we couldn't have worked in such a smooth way.

664
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,310
Actually,

665
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,750
the architecture plan was adjusted

666
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,950
by Architect Li.

667
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,710
Lin'an is different from Northern Zhou.

668
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,230
The weather here is wetter and less windy.

669
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,110
If we do it

670
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,950
strictly according to the hurt in Northern Zhou,

671
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,230
it would be too stuffy inside.

672
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,310
But

673
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,710
based on his adjustment,

674
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,950
we put air holes in the yurt

675
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,590
and also change the sewing method of the blanket.

676
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,150
It's more comfortable to live in the yurt.

677
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,470
You're really a genius, Architect Li.

678
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,430
Even though you've never seen the yurt before,

679
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,070
you can adjust it according to the local conditions.

680
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,750
When will they come back?

681
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,270
You're back from work!

I'm waiting for you to have some midnight snacks.

685
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,670
Miss Zhao, are you going to

686
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,870
treat us?

687

It's Mr. Zhang who wants to treat you.

688
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,390
You've worked so hard on your first day of work.

689

702
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,670
Miss Chen, I have something to tell you.

703
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,270
Are you available now?

Here is the thing.

706
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,190
It suddenly occurred to me last night that

707
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,190
although the draft

708
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,870
of the yurt was finished,

709
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,390
I haven't told you

710
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,110
the details of the interior of the yurt,

711
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,110
which is very different

712
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,820
from what you have here.

713
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,470
I'm afraid if I don't tell you about it,

714
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,310
you may make an awkwardly-decorated yurt.

715
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,710
Thank you, Mr. He.

716
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,710
How about this?

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,860
Please come back here tomorrow

It's late at night and they're together.

752
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,670
What if that barbarian is up to something?

753
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,670
Master will be in danger.

754
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,790
Don’t worry.

755
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,190
She'll be fine.

756
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,590
Mr. He, please don't drink.

757
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,140
Tell me

758
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,390
about the interior of the yurt.

759
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,830
It's already very late now.

760
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,310
And you still have work to do tomorrow.

761
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,910
I'm going to the palace to see His Majesty.

762
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,630
Miss Chen,

763
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,790
will you go back with me?

764
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,430
Brother will go with you.

765
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,300
You two can talk about national affairs.

766
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,470
I won't go back.

767
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,500
OK.

768
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,950
In a few days,

769
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,030
after I finish this,

770
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,510
I'm going back to Northern Zhou.

771
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,510
I really don't want to leave

772
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,830
this beautiful and bustling Lin'an city.

773
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,270
Our two states have been doing business for years.

774
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,950
You can come back anytime you want to.

775
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,470
Will you be happy to see me again?

776
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,070
Of course I will.

777
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,630
Here.

778
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,710
Miss Chen.

779
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,350
Thank you for everything.

780
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,350
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

781
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,170
[Yi Mu Restaurant]

782
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,440
[Yi Mu Restaurant]

783
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,810
[Yi Mu Restaurant]

784
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,750
Have a drink with me.

785
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,500
[Yi Mu Restaurant]

786
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,469
Like this?

787
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,670
Miss Chen, you're really good.

788
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,070
You described it very well.

789
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,830
Drink the wine and air your grievances.

790
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,190
Come on.

791
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,070
Miss Chen is in the opposite private room.

792
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,910
You can see her anytime.

793
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,190
Li Qingfeng,

794
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,190
I don’t know if it’s the best time,

795
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,190
but I want to tell you that,

796
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,110
actually,

797
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,390
I haven't really gotten over you.

798
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,710
Maybe

799
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,350
it's really inappropriate

800
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,190
and indecent for me to say it at this moment.

801
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,790
But I swear this is the last time I say it.

802
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,830
Since you showed up in my family's mansion

803
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,350
and got my embroidered ball,

804
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,030
I couldn't help falling in love.

805
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,590
I like you.

806
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,390
I don't care about your background.

807
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,030
I like you for what you are.

808
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,870
Even if my father

809
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,230
and my brothers object,

810
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,230
I don't care.

811
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,390
I only care about you.

812
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,550
I don't know architecture.

813
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,270
I can't work with you like Miss Chen.

814
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,870
Maybe

815
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,310
I don't really know how to love someone.

816
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,070
and did many things that you hate.

817
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,310
But from the very beginning,

818
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,630
I've been in love with you.

819
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,150
After you rejected me

820
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,990
and decided to be with Miss Chen,

821
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,750
I felt so painful.

822
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,270
But I still can't get over you.

823
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,110
Can you understand that?

824
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,310
If you love Miss Chen,

825
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,790
I hope you're the one who's loved.

826
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,110
If you two break up,

827
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,310
I hope

828
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,750
you'll let me be the one who loves you.

829
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,870
Li Qingfeng.

830
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,150
I will never like anybody else so much

831
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,870
in my life.

832
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,630
I want to ask you one last question.

833
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,390
Do I

834
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,630
still have a chance?

835
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,580
Cheers.

836
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,350
Miss Chen, you're really good at drinking.

837
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,390
I'm not.

838
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,030
Not as good as Li Qingfeng.

839
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,990
We're talking here,

840
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,750
but you keep mentioning Li Qingfeng.

841
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,590
Aren’t you afraid that I'll be upset by that?

842
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,550
Do I?

843
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,030
Then forget about him.

844
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,390
I’m still mad at him.

845
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,390
Come on.

846
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,710
Cheers.

847
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,150
You...

848
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,310
What are you doing?

849
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,190
I...

850
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,190
Li Qingfeng.

851
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,390
What are you doing here? Don't disturb me.

852
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,750
Miss Chen and I were just drinking and chatting.

853
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,990
Why did you come here without invitation?

854
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:15,870
Cheers.

855
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,270
OK.

856
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,230
Let's drink.

857
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,110
Cheers!

858
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,710
What are you doing?

859
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Don't use my cup.

860
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,510
Very good.

861
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,830
I've said what I should say.

862
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,150
I'm taking her back to Wood Feather House.

863
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:40,910
Miss Chen,

864
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,580
I'll take my leave.

865
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,870
See you.

866
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,430
Take care.

867
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,870
You came to pick me up?

868
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,590
Why did you bring him here?

869
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,870
For the draft.

870
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,550
What else can we do here?

871
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,670
Draft?

872
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,990
Then why did you drink?

873
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,590
You're so boring.

874
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,310
Why couldn't we drink?

875
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,390
You always come here to drink.

876
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,630
Why can't I?

877
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,350
Do you know what he's up to?

878
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,790
Aren’t you afraid?

879
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,910
Mr. He is not a bad guy.

880
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,070
How do you know he is not?

881
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,510
I...

882
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,430
I just know.

883
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,190
You

884
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,750
must be jealous

885
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,630
because I'm close to him.

886
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,230
You know I’m jealous.

887
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,430
