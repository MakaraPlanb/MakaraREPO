[Episode 17]

4
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,670
Mr. Zhou, thank you for arranging meals and accommodation for us.

5
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,070
You all came from afar

6
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,350
to help me solve this problem of repairing the bridge.

7
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,270
Of course the county government should arrange for you.

8
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,670
Mr. Zhou, then I'll be frank with you.

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,229
This was the Xu's stockade's fault.

10
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,150
They are supposed to pay

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,340
half of the money.

12
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,150
Didn't Mr. Zhou

13
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,710
talk to Chief Xu in private?

14
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,390
Of course I know who's right and who's wrong.

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,270
But

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,030
I have paid my visit to the Xu's stockade for not less than ten times.

17
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,270
I just couldn't communicate with them.

18
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,510
But you are the county magistrate.

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,829
How could a chief dare not listen to you?

20
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,750
Miss, what does that mean?

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
Although I'm the county magistrate,

22
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,990
I also have to think for the people.

23
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,430
I can't take the officials

24
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,510
to force the people to pay the money, right?

25
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,790
If so, I'll become a so-called robber.

26
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,140
It's quite a tough job for you, Mr. Zhou.

27
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,230
I've been an official for more than ten years.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,829
I've never met

29
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,470
such a difficult matter.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,110
How about this?

31
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,350
I think Mr. Zhou

32
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
was quite annoyed by them today.

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,710
Since we came here from Lin'an,

34
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,510
we will get this problem solved.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,829
Just leave it to us.

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,470
As soon as we figure out a way,

37
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,430
we will inform you right away.

38
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,070
If you think it's OK,

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,460
we’ll discuss it with the people in two stockades.

[The Xu's Stockade]

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,550
Boss Luo,

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,910
What do you think... You!

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,830
Me?

44
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,830
Follow me.

45
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,950
She must think Boss Luo is here to ask for the money.

46
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,350
That is the reason why we came.

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,910
Let's go and have a look.

48
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,430
Here.

49
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,829
Whether it's the distance from the bridge downstream

50
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,990
or the width of the river,

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,390
it's the most suitable of all.

52
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,950
Look.

53
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,630
What is that?

54
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,070
I think someone had set up a Sand Filtration Floodgate here.

55
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,310
Come here.

56
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,470
Come.

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,910
It seems like someone had pulled it out of the water.

58
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,140
So weird. Who would do such a thing?

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,070
If we don't pull it out,

60
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,870
are we just going to let the fish die?

61
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,350
Sir, what do you mean?

62
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,070
The Sand Filtration Floodgate...

63
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,470
I don't care about what a Sand Filtration Floodgate is.

64
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,070
The people of the Zhang's stockade

65
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,430
are always gonna pull it out every time we see it.

66
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,430
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,269
Are you also going to make

68
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,350
such things that could do harm to people's life?

69
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,470
We...

70
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,310
It's fine.

71
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,670
Sir, we want to see Chief Zhang

72
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,630
to get some information about the situation.

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,670
Could you please you show us a way?

74
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,590
We want to see him.

75
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,790
All of you, get up!

76
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,390
So it’s a trap.

77
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,310
Wang Sheng,

78
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,030
you must protect everyone later.

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,310
Miss Han.

80
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,070
You need to run first if we start a fight.

81
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,670
I won't be a burden.

82
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,470
Come, have a seat.

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,550
OK. Come.

84
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,430
I know why you are here.

85
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,030
It’s just that if you want to see Chief Xu,

86
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
it’s not that easy.

87
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,470
You should have a drink with our fellows first.

88
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,910
Come on. Drink up.

89
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,150
Niaoniao, don't force yourself to drink.

90
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,990
If I can't drink any more,

91
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,390
Boss Luo, you can drink it for me then.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,670
If we can't get the fish out,

93
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,230
they will stink in the pond.

94
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,270
You have to think of a way.

95
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,510
Yes, you should.

96
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,630
The fish really are going to stink.

97
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,909
Enough.

98
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,110
Didn't the new craftsmen team say

99
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,670
they would come up with a solution in three days?

100
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,510
I don't trust any craftsmen team.

101
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,550
You know how many fish were killed

102
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,790
by the last craftsmen team.

103
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,950
You go find the chief yourself.

104
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,110
I'm going home to be with my wife.

105
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,110
Look, here she is.

106
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,190
Let's go.

107
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,350
Chief Zhang.

108
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,190
Guys.

109
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,470
Chief Zhang.

110
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,110
What's going on?

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,910
Don't mention it. Tell me.

112
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,110
How are you going to repair the bridge?

113
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,990
Of course we will repair the bridge.

114
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,670
But we came to Chief Zhang today

115
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,630
only to ask

116
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,350
if we can build a Sand Filtration Floodgate

117
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,830
in the river outside the village.

118
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,100
What?

119
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,510
Another Sand Filtration Floodgate?

120
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,110
No! Absolutely no!

121
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,910
No way!

122
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,230
You can't build the Sand Filtration Floodgate.

123
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,110
Five years ago, when the bridge was built,

124
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,670
we also set one up then.

125
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,659
But the silt was too thick.

126
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,750
The fish could not live in the water then at all.

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,230
For a whole year,

128
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,750
the Zhang's stockade made a bare living by borrowing money.

129
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,230
We suffered a great loss.

130
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,780
So you mean

131
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,110
you removed the original Sand Filtration Floodgate?

132
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,870
That’s not a Sand Filtration Floodgate.

133
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,230
It's a Man Killing Floodgate.

134
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,550
It was ruining the lives of the people in the Zhang's stockade.

135
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,790
But just because

136
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,190
you removed the Sand Filtration Floodgate,

137
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,790
the wooden bridge collapsed, right?

138
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,470
You can't blame it on us.

139
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,870
Frankly speaking,

140
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,470
we'll pay for the bridge construction,

141
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,830
only if the Xu's stockade pays half of it.

142
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,750
Otherwise, you can leave as soon as possible.

143
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,550
Let's go.

144
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,350
Let's go.

145
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,230
Leave Jinnan as soon as possible.

146
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:12,990
OK.

147
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,030
We’ll leave now.

148
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,350
Let's go.

149
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,510
Come on.

150
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,830
Brothers, come on.

151
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,910
Drink up.

152
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,390
Fill it up.

153
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,830
Drink.

154
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,030
Drink up!

155
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,750
Mine's empty.

156
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,190
Here, fill it up.

157
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,150
Cheers.

158
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,550
Alright, stop drinking.

159
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,020
Boss Luo,

160
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,230
you have a high tolerance.

161
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,150
It seems like your wife also has a high tolerance.

162
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,350
How could you tell?

163
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,150
Besides,

164
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,510
inside the stockade besides Chief Xu,

165
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,950
I’m afraid only I know her best.

167
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,990
That’s it for today.

168
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,430
If you have any questions,

169
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,910
just ask me.

170
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,350
Oh no.

171
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,830
I really can’t remember the way.

172
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,310
Li Qingfeng, you need to think of a way!

173
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,870
We are really lost.

174
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,510
Didn't you say you would take me to look for the way?

175
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,950
What did you take me here for?

176
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,150
What are you planning to do?

177
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,710
You're being sarcastic to me.

178
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,429
It seems that the two of us

179
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,750
are going to spend the night in the forest.

180
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,860
I don't want to.

181
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,750
It's so dark that I can see nothing.

182
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,590
What are you looking at?

183
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,350
Wait for me. I’ll get some light for you.

184
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,390
Boss Luo. Come here.

185
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,750
What are you doing? Carry her.

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,990

199

We went to the upper reaches together.

204
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,990
Then we met a fisherman

205
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,910
saying he would take them to the Zhang's stockade.

206
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,110
Then they let me come back by myself.

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,230

208
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,870

how did it go with the Xu's stockade today?

250
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,190
I’ve asked Luo and Wang Sheng

251
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,310
to buy medicine for you.

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,190
where are the files Luo organized?

259
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,070
I want to look at them.

260
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,550
You've taken the medicine.

261
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,190
You should rest early today.

262
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,070
But I still want to find a solution as soon as possible.

266
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,310
OK, I’ll listen to you.

267
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll rest early.

268
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,990
OK. Sleep early.

269
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,190
I’ll go back to my room.

270
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,910
My light.

271
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,510
Can you warm me up?

272
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,150
They depend on the river to change the water in the fish pond.

273
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,550
And the best part to set up the Sand Filtration Floodgate

274
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,510
is just near the fish pond of the Zhang's stockade.

275
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,310
If we set up a Sand Filtration Floodgate,

276
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,190
there must be a lot of mud and sand silting in the river.

277
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,190
In that case,

278
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,590
the fish pond of the Zhang's stockade will be ruined.

279
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,030
I see.

280
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,070
So the Zhang's stockade should be responsible

281
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,950
for the collapse of the bridge?

282
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,030
But the law works for human relations.

283
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,510
Besides, the fish pond is the bloodline of the Zhang's stockade.

284
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,830
They had no other ways.

285
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,470
How can we blame them?

286
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,870
Is there any other way?

287
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,790
There's only one way.

288
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,750
Make the bridge more stable.

289
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,710
In this way, even if there isn't a Sand Filtration Floodgate,

290
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,310
the bridge can stand still.

291
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,870
But if we do so,

292
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,350
the project will become much more difficult

293
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,310
and we'll be needing more money.

294
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,830
It’s a lot of trouble.

295
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,350
It is always a lot of trouble when it comes to money.

296
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,310
The Xu's stockade still refuses to pay?

297
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,830
Actually, Chief Xu

298
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,590
is not unreasonable.

299
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,780
It's just that these years

300
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,190
they have earned little money from the harvests.

301
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,230
It's gonna cost thousands of taels to repair the bridge.

302
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,110
They really can't afford it.

303
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,910
I also inquired about it.

304
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,910
They could only afford 500 taels at most.

305
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,710
That's why they insisted

306
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,870
to pay half the money the Zhang's stockade pays.

307
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,870
What should we do?

308
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,950
In this case,

309
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,390
the Xu's stockade should offer 500 taels

310
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,190
and the Zhang's stockade should offer 1,000 taels.

311
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,830
It's 1,500 taels in total.

312
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,830
Miss, is it enough?

313
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,630
It is enough for a wooden bridge.

314
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,710
But if the Xu's stockade offers 500 taels,

315
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,150
why would the Zhang's stockade be willing to offer 1,000 taels?

316
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,550
You're right.

317
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,870
I remember yesterday Chief Xu said that

318
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,310
no matter how much money was needed,

319
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,350
they would only pay 33 percent of it

320
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,310
and the Zhang's stockade should pay the rest 66 percent.

321
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,830
It seems to be an impasse.

322
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,470
Qingfeng.

323
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,030
if we want to build a firm stone bridge,

324
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,660
how much would it cost?

325
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,830
At least

326
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,230
5,000 taels.

327
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,910
That...That is too much.

328
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,580
Even if I'm so merciful,

329
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,790
I don't have that much money.

330
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,470
So that's the problem of the Ministry of Works.

331
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,590
In my opinion,

332
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,870

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,070
Not yet.

Why just leave it here?

In this situation,

00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,780
it's useless to go through these.

as architects,

361
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,829
we can't stop doing what we are supposed to do.

362
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,150
If we can find a way to save money to build the bridge,

363
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,579
everything will be solved.

364
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,390
That's right.

365
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,910

other factors that are not included in the project

367
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,790
affect our judgment.

368
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,500
We should calm down and pay more attention.

369
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,390
That's how we can find inspiration.

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,670
I was right about you.

371
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,830
Do you know that

372
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,590
I didn't come to the Wood Feather House

373
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,030
to be an architect?

374
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,030
Can you guess my original intention?

375
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,870
I don't know.

376
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,870
I came to learn from you.

377
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,150
You must be so happy to hear that, right?

378
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,990
Actually, I don't want to be your master.

379
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,550
Don't be ungrateful!

380
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,590
You misunderstood me. That's not what I mean.

381
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,710
Then what...

382
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,310
You are so annoying.

383
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,990
Sir, are you asleep?

384
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,220
Not yet.

385
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,100
Come in.

386
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,590
Are you still not feeling well?

387
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,150
I want to die.

388
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,830
Don’t take it seriously.

389
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,590
What’s the matter?

390
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,630
Your clothes are dirty.

391
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,510
Since Mr. Wang took them off for you last night,

392
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,150
they've been placed here.

393
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,830
I'll go have them washed.

394
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,950
I don't want you to do this.

395
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,830
You can just throw away the dirty clothes. You don't have to be so busy.

396
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,350
Why throw them away if you can still wear them?

397
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,670
You are not a maid when you're with me.

398
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,780
Put them down.

399
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,110
In this case,

400
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,110
won't we be needing a lot of stones for the construction?

401
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,750
Even so,

402
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm still worried that the bridge is not strong enough.

403
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,350
Are we really doing a losing business?

404
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,630
Five thousand taels is too much.

405
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,870
And construction isn't doing charity.

406
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,230
Let alone Luo,

407
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,470
I’m afraid Miss Zhao would lose too much for this.

408
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,710
Maybe can you make it 1000 taels?

409
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,830
I'm also thinking

410
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,830
if there is a way to save costs.

411
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,510
What's wrong?

412
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,190
This medicine works like sleeping drugs.

413
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,550
You have caught a cold.

414
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,870
You ought to have a good rest.

415
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,550
Maybe this is the sleeping drug

416
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,710
for you to get some sleep.

417
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,550
It’s late.

418
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,630
You should go back to your room and rest.

419
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,270
Otherwise are you going to make a bunch of stones out of thin air?

420
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,870
Fine.

421
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,310
Why are you staring at me?

422
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,070
Maybe we can really make a bunch of stones.

423
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,550
Did the fever really make you dizzy?

424
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,270
Think about

425
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,270
what the place where we're staying has.

426
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,390
You mean...

427
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,180
Yes, let's go.

428
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,030
Look.

429
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,630
Li Qingfeng,

430
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,890

Aren't you gonna say something?

481
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,220
I don't know why I slept in her room last night.

482
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,310
But nothing happened between us.

483
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,510
You forgot how you got out?

484
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,870
How can I believe you?

485
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,750
I passed out after taking the medicine last night

486
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,630
and remembered nothing.

487
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,110
It's not like what you imagined.

488
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,630
What medicine could make you take off your clothes?

489
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm afraid it was aphrodisiac you took!

490
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,860
You are slandering Langyue.

491
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,270
So you mean I woke up and ate a bun

492
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,590
just to slander master?

493
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,310
And you slept in her room for a whole night

494
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,550
but you're innocent?

495
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,070
If you don't believe me, go ask her.

496
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,230
If there's nothing else, I'll go back.

497
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,950
I'm not done yet.

498
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,390
Li Qingfeng,

499
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,990
since the first day I came to the Wood Feather House,

500
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,950
I have disliked you.

501
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,510
But I said nothing for master's sake.

502
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,310
Later, she got blind.

503
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,590
That's a bit inappropriate.

504
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,390
Anyway, she then started to have feelings for you.

505
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,430
My...My heart hurts.

506
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,710
But for the sake of master's happiness, I endured it.

507
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,590
Now,

508
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,430
how dare you do that to master?

509
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,070
You're so dead.

510
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,990
Official Meng, let me say it again.

511
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,190
Nothing really happened between us.

512
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,830
Even if anything did happen,

513
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,790
I will take my responsibility for it.

514
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,790
Take your responsibility? How?

515
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,030
Can you afford to take the responsibility?

516
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,150
In my mind, I've decided to marry Langyue.

517
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,590
Why can't I afford to take the responsibility?

518
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,750
You idiot.

519
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,190
Do you know who she is?

520
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,670
Good luck to you!

521
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,350
Who is it?

522
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,470
Master, it's me.

523
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,110
Come in.

524
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,790
Master, how dare Li Qingfeng did that to you?

525
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,510
What are you thinking?

526
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,750
It's just that he caught a cold last night

527
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,390
and slept in my room after taking the medicine.

528
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,870
Last night,

529
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,550
I slept in Luo’s room.

530
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,670
I came back this morning.

531
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,230
You can ask Luo if you don’t believe me.

532
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,180
You're just worrying for nothing.

533
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,940
Did you misunderstand Li Qingfeng again

534
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,750
and say something bad to him?

535
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,310
I didn't say anything I think.

536
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,110
Just two men talked to each other.

537
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,030
It's nothing.

538
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,150
You just can't get rid of that precipitance of yours.

539
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,990
Master, it really is not because of my precipitance.

540
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,030
I saw him come out of your room myself.

541
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,870
He doesn't know who you really are.

542
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,670
I'm just afraid he'll get beheaded.

543
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,390
Who dares to do so?

544
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,390
Master, you can't keep pretending to be ignorant.

545
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,340
He harassed the princess before he became the princess consort.

546
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,750
Can...Can you call that a trivial matter?

547
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,420
Since you said so,

548
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,550
I'll just let him be the princess consort.

549
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,430
I'm not stupid.

550
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,830
It's not up to you

551
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,630
whether he can be the princess consort or not.

552
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,550
You... You don't need to worry about that.

553
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,870
By the way,

554
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,350
since you're here,

555
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,150
I have something to talk to you.

556
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,590
Talk?

557
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,390
About what?

558
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,350
About you and Luo.

559
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,350
Luo and I?

560
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,710
I heard you were drunk yesterday.

561
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,990
Luo took care of you all day, right?

562
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,870
But nothing happened between us.

563
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,910
I believe you.

564
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,180
I just think that

565
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,470
Luo likes you.

566
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,190
Are you looking down on her

567
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,470
because she's just my maid?

568
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,190
How is that possible?

569
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,550
Luo is so cute and well-behaved,

570
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,830
even my mom likes her.

571
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,310
Why would I ever look down on her?

572
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,350
If so,

573
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,510
tell me, do you like Luo?

574
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,270
Master, stop making fun of me.

575
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,470
You're just making a casual match.

576
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,870
You're the one I like.

577
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,830
For so many years...

578
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,750
Then why haven't you

579
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,150
done anything to get in the way of us?

580
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,230
I thought

581
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,110
you have realized

582
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,870
that the person you love is not me any more.

583
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,470
Of course not.

584
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,350
Then what is it?

585
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,510
I know he can't be the princess consort.

586
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,230
Let me tell you the real reason.

587
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,750
I’m not the one you love any more.

588
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,190
But Luo is.

589
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,790
Master, are you...

590
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,670
Are you infected by Li Qingfeng?

591
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,990
Why are you talking nonsense?

592
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,390
Think about it.

593
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,750
Are you happy with me

594
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,070
or are you happy with Luo?

595
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,750
After all, you are the...

596
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,310
It has nothing to do with my identity.

597
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,510
I know you are good to me.

598
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,630
But

599
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,030
I always think

600
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,350
it is just an obsessiveness in your heart.

601
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,710
We grew up together.

602
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,190
In your heart, I'm just your playmate.

603
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,100
The happiness we share together

604
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,870
exists in memories more than in the present, doesn't it?

605
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,380
I often think of

606
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,430
the days we used to play together in the Ministry of Works.

607
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,790
So,

608
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,150
in your heart,

609
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,990
I'm just a playmate when we were young.

610
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,710
And now,

611
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,830
you need to find the one who will accompany you all your life.

612
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,110
That person is Luo.

613
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,630
Luo?

614
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,270
I've always seen Luo as my sister.

615
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,110
Think about it.

616
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,190
During the time in the Wood Feather House,

617
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,670
who is the one you feel happiest,

618
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,590
most relaxed and most carefree with?

619
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,070
Of course it's...

620
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,310
[A Bright Mirror Hung High]

621
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,910
But Chief Xu said

622
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,230
they could afford at most 500 taels.

623
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,030
I asked a lot of craftsmen teams in private.

624
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,670
Without six thousand taels,

625
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,990
I'm afraid the project can't be done.

626
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,420
Of course we know that.

627
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,030
So we came here today

628
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,390
to ask Mr. Zhou

629
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,630
if the government has the money to deal with the fund shortage.

630
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm a noble official.

631
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,590
I...I don't...

632
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,150
Sir, don't get all worked up.

633
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,350
Qingfeng, you talk to Mr. Zhou.

634
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,550
Mr. Zhou.

635
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,990
Yesterday Architect Chen and I

636
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,430
figured out a solution together,

637
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,150
which will only cost 1000 taels.

638
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,420
Maybe we could give it a try.

639
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,290
[A Bright Mirror Hung High]

640
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,950
I'm all ears.

641
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,700
There are two aspects that's gonna cost us the most money on the construction.

642
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,790
One is work force and the other is material.

643
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,310
Therefore, I need the two stockades

644
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,350
to offer me some work force for me to dispatch.

645
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,510
Besides,

646
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,230
there is also a solution to the problem of material.

647
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,510
Don't worry. As long as it is for repairing the bridge,

648
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,190
I can get people to come and help.

649
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,790
But how are you going to save the materials?

650
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,550
I want to bomb the mountain to get the stones.

651
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,230
No, you can't do that.

652
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,790
Why?

653
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,190
To be honest,

654
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,710
Jinnan County

655
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,620
has relied on the mountains and waters since ancient times.

656
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,190
We respect and admire the God of Mountain

657
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,430
and the God of River greatly.

658
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,190
If you really bomb the mountain,

659
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,100
I'm afraid before the bridge is built,

660
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,920
[A Bright Mirror Hung High]

661
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,860
Jinnan County will be in chaos.

662
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,350
It's just inappropriate.

663
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,470
But this is the only way

664
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,990
to save money.

665
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,110
Guys, I still find it inappropriate.

666
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,910
Tomorrow is the deadline.

667
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,190
How about

668
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,550
giving it a second thought?

669
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,390
Please.

670
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,990
Let's eat first.

671
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,510
Actually, it's nothing.

672
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,870
We can just take it as a three-day tour in Jinnan County.

673
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,150
Jinnan County has the best natural resources.

674
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,550
There must be a lot of beautiful scenery and delicious food.

675
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,510
Don't be in such low spirits, you all.

676
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,630
Why don't we take a break

677
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,860
and go out for a walk?

678
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,350
I'll discuss it with the chiefs tomorrow.

679
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,030
Maybe they are not as stubborn as the county magistrate said.

680
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,100
Things will work out themselves.

681
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,750
There are always good ideas.

682
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,590
I think Boss Luo is right.

683
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,070
The day before yesterday

684
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,270
when we visited the Xu's stockade, they were not that rude.

685
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,350
You were so drunk that day.

686
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,190
How could you have remembered even if they were rude?

687
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,070
Meng Yuanxu. How are you not embarrassed to say that about Niaoniao?

688
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,830
Luo, thank you anyway.

689
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,310
Alright.

690
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,790
Let's eat first.

691
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,390
Let's talk after dinner.

692
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,670
Right.

693
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,910
Let's eat first.

694
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,830
Is there anything more important than eating?

695
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,350
Anyway,

696
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,870
I have to get the project done.

697
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,150
I can see that. I also want to.

698
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,310
Some time ago, Langyue was full of worries.

699
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,270
She was not happy until we came to Jinnan.

700
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,310
She promised me

701
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,630
she would come home with me after finishing the work in Jinnan.

702
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,030
So I want to do it well.

703
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,110
What about her true identity...

704
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,990
I don't care about that any more.

705
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,790
I will find out about it sooner or later.

706
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,470
Right.

707
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,150
When two people are together,

708
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,630
happiness is the most important.

709
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,830
I'll take Langyue to see Master Yu today

710
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,950
and ask him if there is a good way to save costs.

711
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,590
We might not come back tonight.

712
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,550
Don't worry about us.

713
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,110
OK. You can just go.

714
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,470
As long as you can come back

715
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,820
before the meeting with the two chiefs

716
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,310

You are here too.

to send me the wedding invitation, right?

Master Yu.

732
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,350
I really have a difficulty this time.

733
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,909
You brat.

734
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,630
I don't care about your problem.

735
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,469
I only care about when you two

736
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,710
are going to send me the invitation.

737
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,909
After this problem is solved.

738
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,750
You...

739
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,830
You are so cunning.

740
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,550
Don't beat around the bush with me.

741
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,710
OK. Go ahead.

742
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,350
What's the problem?

743
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,949
We are going to build a bridge in Jinnan County.

744
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,550
Why are you the one to deal with such a difficult problem?

745
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,670
Master Yu, you know about it?

746
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,989
Yes.

747
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,310
OK. Let's sit down and talk.

748
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,710
What do you think, Master Yu?

749
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,070
Can this work?

750
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,710
Wait.

751
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,830
No, it can't work.

752
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,710
Why not?

753
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,390
I know.

754
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,310
Bombing the mountain to get the stones

755
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,950
is a very clever way to save costs.

756
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,390
But you just said you couldn't set up the Sand Filtration Floodgate.

757
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,380
Then you must make the bridge

758
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,390
bigger and firmer,

759
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,710
which means more stone materials will be needed.

760
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,950
There's one thing you might not take into consideration.

761
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,750
The stones you get from the explosion

762
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,470
must be polished before using.

763
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,110
If you want to polish them,

764
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,470
you'll need stonemasons

765
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,950
to do the job.

766
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,310
Even if you call on all the stonemasons in Jinnan County,

767
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,470
they are still not enough for you.

768
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,940
And then you'll have to call on more stonemasons to come from Lin'an.

769
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,390
In this way, the cost will be increased.

770
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,950
Not to mention 1,000 taels,

771
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,670
it's still impossible to add 1,000 more.

772
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,470
But

773
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,950
traveling around these years,

774
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,270
I've seen a lot of

775
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,070
uncanny but fine water conservancy projects.

776
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,790
Let me try to recollect

777
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,830
if there's anything I can take example by.

778
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,470
Thank you so much.

779
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,030
In Ningbo, Zhejiang,

780
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,230
there is a Tashan Weir.

781
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,870
It was built by a county magistrate in the Tang Dynasty.

782
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,660
Nope.

783
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,470
It's a project that resists the intrusion of sea tides

784
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,670
and diverts fresh water from inland rivers for irrigation,

785
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,870
which is very different from your bridge.

786
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,710
What else?

787
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,310
Shanxi!

788
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,270
There's a Zhengguo Canal in Jingyang, Shanxi.

789
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,230
Still nope.

790
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,430
It's also used for diversion irrigation.

791
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,670
And Guangxi!

792
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,310
there's a Qinzao Canal in Xing'an County, Guangxi.

793
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,470
Can we take example by it?

794
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,380
Still no.

795
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,350
Sichuan! Sichuan has a Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

796
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,470
Let me tell you.

797
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,230
The scenery there is so beautiful.

798
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,310
It's everywhere.

799
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,470
Very beautiful.

800
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,910
I... Master Yu.

801
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,910
Stop showing off

802
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,460
your experiences of traveling around the world.

803
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,950
Tell us

804
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,910
if there is anything we can learn from.

805
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,710
Don't get all worked up.

806
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,940
Calm down. Give me a moment.

807
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,340
I got it.

808
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,270
There is a Lancang River in Yunnan.

809
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,910
I once saw

810
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,310
a unique way to cross the river there.

811
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,510
I called it the River Crossing Cable Bridge.

812
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,430
What is that?

813
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,710
It's actually very simple.

814
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,950
Look.

815
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,500
This is a river.

816
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,670
All you need to do on either side of the river,

817
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,580
which is here,

818
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,470
here, here and here,

819
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,150
is to set up four giant stelae that are at least three feet tall.

820
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,070
And then

821
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,390
use a lot of stones

822
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,870
to fix the bottoms of the stelae.

823
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,670
And then

824
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,870
connect the two stelae with a chain.

825
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,150
A chain.

826
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,940
And put an iron ring on this chain.

827
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,150
These iron rings are used for fixing ships.

828
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,710
In this case,

829
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,870
no matter how fast the river runs,

830
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,110
people can cross the river safely.

831
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,070
But if the rain is too heavy

832
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,190
and the water level exceeds the water line,

833
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,270
then don't take the chance to cross the river.

834
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,750
Nice. It can definitely work.

835
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,190
Now 1,000 taels is gonna be enough.

836
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,910
As long as it can solve the problem,

837
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,070
this River Crossing Cable Bridge is also a bridge.

838
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,710
This is the only solution for now.

839
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,990
If not,

840
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,630
that 1000 taels

841
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,950
is never going to be enough to repair the bridge.

842
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,950
But I have to remind you.

843
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,790
Jinnan County is different from Lin'an City.

844
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,510
Everyone in Jinnan County

845
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,110
believes in the God of Mountain.

846
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,390
If you want to explode the mountain and take the stones,

847
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,390
you should be mentally prepared

848
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,470
that they might not agree with this.

849
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,910
Don't worry.

850
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,870
We have Boss Luo

851
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,310
who is very eloquent.

852
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:11,950
By then,

853
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,670
he will convince those two chiefs.

854
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,630
Really?

855
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,510
That’s awesome.

856
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,470
You young people are all talented.

857
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,470
Here.

858
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,430
Today I'm gonna make a toast with tea instead of wine

859
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,390
to wish you success.

860
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,790
Cheers.

861
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,910
Cheers.

862
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,220
Boy, you should know that

863
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,510
that bridge in Jinnan

864
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,950
has been a pain in the ass for many years?

865
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,430
Unexpectedly,

866
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,790
you are going to be the one to solve the problem.

867
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,340
One day,

868
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,870
you will be like Liu Tong from the previous dynasty

869
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,310
to leave a good reputation in the history of construction of the Xiao Dynasty.

870
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,310
I don't care about reputation.

871
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,630
I just want to leave behind a few architectures.

872
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,510
Great.

873
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,870
As long as you have the heart,

874
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,510
you're worthy of being a good architect.

875
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,430
Your father is not as good as you in this aspect.

876
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,390
There's no need to mention him.

877
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,230
How long have you not visited him?

878
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,950
When you go back next time,

879
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,470
take her with you.

880
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,430
I'll take Langyue back with me next time.

881
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,670
You two are in love and a good match for each other.

882
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,110
You should take marriage into consideration.

883
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,780
Right?

884
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,070
By the way,

885
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,950
I haven't asked you yet. Are you from Lin'an?

886
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,070
What does your father do?

887
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,190
Master Yu, thank you so much for today.

888
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,790
When I'm here next time,

889
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,230
I'll bring you a large pot of plum blossom wine.

890
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,990
It's late.

891
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,950
Langyue and I should go back to Jinnan.

892
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,830
It's late.

893
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,150
There's no need for you to go back in such a hurry.

894
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,270
I happen to have an empty room here.

895
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,710
I'll clean it up for you.

896
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,310
You can stay here.

897
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,270
Mr. Yu.

898
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,580
In the same room?

899
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,350
Yes.

900
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,750
Girl, you are thinking too much.

901
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,990
I won't tell others

902
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,110
and tarnish your reputation.

903
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,070
This is a remote mountain and few people are around here.

904
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,990
You two are clearly in complete harmony.

905
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,550
Don't care too much about these etiquettes.

906
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,860
Last time in Jinnan,

907
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,190
I slept in your room once.

908
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,350
One more time is really nothing.

909
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,150
I think you did it on purpose.

910
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,110
Maybe.
