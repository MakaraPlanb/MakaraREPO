[Episode 18]

4
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,509
Are we going to

5
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,750
sit here all night?

6
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,789
If not so, how are we going to sleep?

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,670
I’m afraid

8
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
we should lie down and sleep.

9
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,030
Last time in Jinnan,

10
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,430
I slept while you sat.

11
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,550
Today it's your turn to sleep and my turn to sit.

12
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,950
Only by doing so is it fair.

13
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,590
You should just ask Master Yu

14
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,390
if he has some sleeping pills for me.

15
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,790
Only that's fair.

16
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,220
How can I sleep

17
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,540
with you staring at me?

18
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,070
Right.

19
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,350
I can't sleep either like this.

20
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,870
Let's go to sleep.

21
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,030
Can I fall asleep with you being like this?

22
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,990
I can sleep like this.

23
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,430
Langyue.

24
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,710
What?

25
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,710
I want to...

26
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,150
No, you don't want to.

27
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,700
Don't even think about it.

28
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,909
I want to marry you.

29
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,430
Lord Wang.

30
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,670
Why are you here?

31
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,380
Didn't I ask you to stay in Jinnan with Liu?

32
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,510
Lord Wang.

33
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,390
Her Highness's living with Mr. Li

34
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,710
is a very serious issue.

35
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,190
Should we report to His Majesty immediately?

36
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,510
I can make my own final decision.

37
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,590
In my opinion,

38
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,630
we should report it as soon as possible.

39
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,430
Let me say it again.

40
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,630
I can make my own final decision.

41
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,590
His Majesty ordered that

42
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,790
everything about Her Highness

43
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,300
must be reported honestly.

44
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,350
So His Majesty sent you to spy on me.

45
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,190
No, no.

46
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,830
Lord Situ.

47
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,590
Lord Situ, why are you here?

48
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,630
Since the Wood Feather House took over Jinnan's work,

49
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,030
as the minister of the Ministry of Works,

50
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,990
I have arrived in Jinnan way ahead of you.

51
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,950
His Majesty never intended to spy on anyone.

52
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,100
He's just worried about Her Highness's safety.

53
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,150
Mr. Wang, don't think too much.

54
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,750
You can

55
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,820
report this for Lord Wang right now.

56
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,790
Tomorrow morning,

57
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,190
we'll be waiting for His Majesty's order.

58
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,990
Go.

59
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,909
Yes.

60
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,940
Lord Wang is such a hero in the army.

61
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,909
You cherish affection and personal loyalty,

62
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,430
which is why I've admired you for so long.

63
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,470
But you and I are both subordinates.

64
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,470
We must remember the grace of His Majesty.

65
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,510
You don't need to worry about

66
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,510
the safety of Her Highness here.

67
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,270
I think

68
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,070
we should go back to Jinnan and wait for the imperial order.

69
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,630
I like Master.

70
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,990
I like Luo.

71
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,590
I like Master.

72
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,630
I like Luo.

73
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,710
I like Luo.

74
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,790
I like Master.

75
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,470
I like Luo.

76
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,350
I like Master.

77
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,790
I like Luo.

78
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,990
Sir, what are you doing?

79
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,590
No...Nothing.

80
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,590
Where are you going?

81
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,150
I...

82
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,390
My lady asked me to go shopping

83
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,630
and buy some Jinnan's specialties

84
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,460
that are delicious or fun

85
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,470
and bring them back to Miss Zhao.

86
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,510
You are not familiar with this place.

87
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,430
Let me go with you.

88
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,380
OK. Let's go.

89
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,470
I like Master.

90
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,390
I like Luo.

91
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,670
I like Master.

92
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,630
I like Luo.

93
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,230
Sir,

94
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,190
what did you just say?

95
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,910
What did I say?

96
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,110
I said nothing.

97
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,150
Let's go.

[County Government of Jinnan]

99
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,150
Here.

100
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,830
When I was little,

101
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,230
my dad fed my mother like this.

102
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,030
They thought I never saw them.

103
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,510
Here.

104
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,300
How is it?

105
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,310
Is the shrimp I peeled delicious?

106
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,909
What's wrong?

107
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,230
Is it not good?

108
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,070
This salted shrimp tastes the same as Yangzhou's.

109
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,750
Jinnan

110
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,550
is located between Yangzhou and Lin'an.

111
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,870
It’s normal that the food tastes like Yangzhou's dishes.

112
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,350
Niaoniao,

113
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,020
are you missing your home?

114
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,910
Hot! Hot! Hot!

115
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,470
Drink some water, sir.

116
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,270
Have some water.

117
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,470
I've blown on it. Eat.

118
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,630
Hot! Hot! Hot!

119
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,390
Sorry, sir.

120
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,870
I thought it was cool enough.

121
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,150
Is there a blister?

122
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,670
I don't see one.

123
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,110
Just kidding.

124
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,950
It's not hot because you've blown on it.

125
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,870
Really?

126
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,030
Yes.

127
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,950
The tofu is roasted so well.

128
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,510
It's crispy outside,

129
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,390
while it’s smooth inside.

130
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,470
Let me blow on it for you.

131
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,470
Is it good?

132
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:29,990
Luo,

133
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,030
tell me,

134
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,830
why are you so good to me?

135
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,950
Because you are good to me.

136
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,310
How am I good to you?

137
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,190
Every time you gave her Lady something,

138
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,940
you gave me the same thing.

139
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,870
Also,

140
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,270
you are always willing to talk to me.

141
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,270
You also like to hang out with me

142
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,790
and you taught me how to play Pai Gow.

143
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,350
Anyway,

144
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,710
I think except her Lady,

145
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,380
you treated me the best.

146
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,100
Wasn't there any time when I treated you badly?

147
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,350
There was.

148
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,550
Right? I also think so.

149
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,990
When?

150
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,030
The time when you made Madam misunderstand

151
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,630
that I was your...

152
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,230
That I was your...

153
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,390
What's wrong with that?

154
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,980
But I am not!

155
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,670
I can’t pretend to be like I am...

156
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,790
Every time I see your mother,

157
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,630
I get super nervous.

158
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,270
My mother likes to find out the truth.

159
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,310
I'll tell her the truth

160
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,630
when I get back to Lin'an.

161
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,150
OK...

162
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,350
Sir.

163
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,910
I want to go back first.

164
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,900
OK.

165
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,230
Be careful with your words later.

166
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,590
Don't worry.

167
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,500
We're only bombing the mountain.

168
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,310
It's not like we're going to start a fight.

169
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,310
Sirs,

170
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,350
sorry to keep you waiting.

171
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,270
We're here.

172
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,910
Bro.

173
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,910
The deadline we've agreed on is up.

174
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,670
Have you come up with a good idea?

175
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,030
Yes, of course.

176
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,580
Don’t pretend that you're very close to him.

177
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,750
Boss Luo,

178
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,990
we are all waiting for

179
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,980
your fair opinion.

180
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,910
Don't worry.

181
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,310
I am here.

182
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,630
That means I'm here with a solution.

183
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,030
Tell us, please.

184
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,590
Listen.

185
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,420
I have been to Xu's stockaded village before

186
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,630
and talked to Chief Xu.

187
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,910
Chief Xu said that

188
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,310
they could only afford at most 500 taels.

189
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,870
Yes, I did.

190
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,590
We would never pay 1000 taels.

191
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,030
It's not like that.

192
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,670
The Zhang's stockaded village only needs to offer 500 taels as well.

193
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,790
A total of 1,000 taels is enough for repairing the bridge?

194
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,670
What if after three or five years,

195
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,270
the bridge collapses?

196
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,910
Are you trying to fool us?

197
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,540
Right!

198
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,860
We've asked around.

199
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,710
There's no way to repair the bridge without six or seven thousand taels.

200
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,510
That's right.

201
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,350
That's right.

202
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,630
Others can't repair it.

203
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,900
But I can.

204
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,630
But what I want to build is a river crossing cable bridge.

205
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,150
A river crossing cable bridge? What kind of a bridge is that?

206
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,110
This river crossing cable bridge

207
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,790
can help you cross the river on a boat

208
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,990
and not be threatened by the water.

209
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,190
The river crossing cable bridge can also be called a bridge?

210
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,030
Boss Luo,

211
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,630
are you fooling us around?

212
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,470
Isn't your purpose to cross the river?

213
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,550
You couldn’t cross the river

214
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
because the river ran too fast.

215
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,150
As long as there is this bridge,

216
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,870
you'll be able to cross the river safely.

217
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,190
Besides, you only need to offer 500 taels each.

218
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,550
Isn't that a happy thing for everyone?

219
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,030
As long as we can cross the river safely,

220
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,670
I am on board.

221
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,590
We have no objection.

222
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,710
OK.

223
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,470
Great.

224
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,230
We have come to an agreement

225
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,270
on the most critical problem.

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,070
Next,

227
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,310
I hope after we start work,

228
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,110
the two chiefs can offer some labor to help us.

229
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,390
It's not a big deal.

230
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,710
We will do our best.

231
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,470
We will as well.

232
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,910
OK.

233
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,740
Let's talk about the materials.

234
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,940
I want to bomb the mountain and get the stones.

235
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,140
Bomb the mountain? Bomb the mountain?

236
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,990
How can this work?

237
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,430
Right.

238
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,750
How can this work?

239
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,590
You can't do this.

240
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,350
How can you bomb the mountain?

241
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,030
Yeah.

242
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,030
Boss Luo,

243
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,390
this isn't quite appropriate, is it?

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,790
If you irritate the God of Mountain,

245
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,750
it's the people of the two stockades who are going to suffer.

246
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,110
Isn't that a rip-off?

247
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,660
Yes, it must be a rip-off.

248
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,980
You must be kidding us.

249
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,030
Whoever dares to bomb the mountain,

250
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,350
I will bash him up.

251
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,390
Yes.

252
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,550
Even if the Heavenly King comes,

253
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,470
we can never bomb the mountain.

254
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,910
You're only outlanders.

255
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,990
Get the hell out of Jinnan.

256
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,430
But how can do we get stones if we don't explode the mountain?

257
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,110
Originally this project should cost 6000 taels.

258
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,870
But you refused to pay the price.

259
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,870
That's why we came up with the brilliant plan to bomb the mountain.

260
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,110
But you're still not satisfied?

261
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,460
We didn't want to pay

262
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,430
because the Xu's stockade didn't either.

263
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,110
Yes.

264
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,550
You were the one who didn't want to pay.

265
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,390
You were!

266
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,750
Stop arguing. Stop!

267
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,230
Stop! Stop arguing.

268
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,230
Stop arguing!

269
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,230
OK. OK. OK.

270
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,630
Don't push.

271
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,630
Stop arguing.

272
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:04,990
Are you alright?

273
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,510
Sir.

274
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:11,950
Official?

275
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,750
Stop!

276
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,310
Take one step forward if you want to die.

277
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,910
Are you okay?

278
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,390
God of Mountain, please show us some blessings.

279
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,910
What happened?

280
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,230
Please bless the official to be safe.

281
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,190
What should we do, Boss Luo?

282
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,910
What happened?

283
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,230
I'll tell you later.

284
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,990
How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

285
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,710
I...I'm fine. Let's go inside.

286
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,230
OK.

287
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,710
Those people

288
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,310
are really a bunch of lunatics.

289
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,190
Is he okay?

290
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,110
I'm not sure yet.

291
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,110
But I've asked a doctor to come.

292
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,110
Lord Zhou,

293
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,870
don't blame yourself for this.

294
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,590
I didn't expect

295
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,750
he is the son of Mr. Meng.

296
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,430
If anything happens

297
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,830
to him,

298
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,630
I won't be able to keep my job.

299
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,030
In my opinion,

300
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,230
you'd better all go back to Lin'an.

301
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,260
We will not

302
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,670
repair the bridge any more.

303
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,270
We don't know if he is alright or not yet.

304
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,420
We can't leave now.

305
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,790
Lord Zhou,

306
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,870
you should take care of those injured people in both stockades.

307
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,110
I'll take care of things here.

308
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,950
Whether we go or stay,

309
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,230
I will give you an answer.

310
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,150
OK.

311
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,270
I'll go now.

312
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,590
My greetings, your Lord.

313
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,830
When did you arrive here?

314
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,950
Sorry for not welcoming you.

315
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,430
Your Exellency,

316
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,230
may I ask what you're here for this time?

317
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,630
I'm Situ Qing, Minister of the Ministry of Works.

318
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,110
Greetings to your Highness.

319
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,070
Greetings to your Highness.

320
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,510
Your Highness.

321
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,510
Excuse me for not recognizing you.

322
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,030
Those who don't know are innocent.

323
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,940
I should thank Magistrate Zhou

324
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,110
for taking care of me recently.

325
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,910
Please.

326
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,020
Rise.

327
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,590
Yes.

328
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,540
Your Highness,

329
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,870
I know that Lord Meng's son is injured.

330
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,590
Jinnan is now not a good place to stay.

331
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,190
I'll take care of the rest.

332
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,660
You'd better go back to Lin'an.

333
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,550
Is it my brother's idea?

334
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,470
Yes.

335
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,870
Go back and tell my brother

336
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,230
that I am definitely going to

337
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,270
repair the bridge in Jinnan.

338
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,230
When everything is done,

339
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,390
I will go back to Lin'an with the people of the Wood Feather House.

340
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,830
Don't worry about me.

341
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,950
Yes.

342
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,350
Li Qingfeng. Luo Ye.

343
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,430
Greetings, your Minister.

344
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,310
No need.

345
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,510
In the records of the Ministry of Works,

346
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,710
the Wood Feather House has impressed me the most.

347
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,150
Today I finally met you.

348
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,710
You are indeed young and promising.

349
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,870
Li Qingfeng, you are good.

350
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,349
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

351
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,470
I was going to tell you

352
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
after this project.

353
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,030
Well. Your Highness.

354
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,670
After which project are you planning

355
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,589
to leave the Wood Feather House?

356
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,270
I never thought about leaving.

357
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,110
Why did you hide it from me?

358
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,510
Have you ever thought about

359
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,990
how I should face a princess now?

360
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
Do you also really

361
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,910
lay so much stress on the identity of princess?

362
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,590
Do you also

363
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,870
care so much about the identity the society gave me just like others?

364
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,630
But with you,

365
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,150
I am still Chen Langyue

366
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,590
and your deputy architect.

367
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,110
Because you are the princess,

368
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,390
you think the identity of the princess is not important.

369
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,270
Even if I really think it doesn't matter,

370
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,750
what about protocols and traditions?

371
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,150
What about the differences between superiors and inferiors?

372
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,750
How can I ignore them?

373
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,790
So do you mean that

374
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,910
you want me to leave the Wood Feather House?

375
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,590
Li Qingfeng,

376
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,910
I never meant to hide it from you.

377
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,270
If I said I was a princess at the very beginning,

378
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,270
would you let me enter the Wood Feather House?

379
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,230
I also want to live freely.

380
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,270
I also want to live as I wish.

381
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,190
But the identity of princess

382
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,750
is not something I can keep or throw away

383
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,150
as I wish.

384
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,630
At this moment,

385
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,590
I want to be part of the Wood Feather House.

386
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,670
Can't I?

387
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,150
Is the Wood Feather House

388
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,150
important to you?

389
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,910
Of course.

390
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,030
Why?

391
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,910
Because

392
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,790
there's a fool here

393
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,670
who cares and worries about me

394
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,110
but never learns how to speak appropriately.

395
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,670
He is such a track-minded fool

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,550
but a fool who makes me laugh

397
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,990
while also makes me angry all the time.

398
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,750
A fool

399
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,100
♫How many times I miss you at night♫

400
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,510

♫How many times I travel back in time♫

406
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,670
I was being too harsh.

407

♫Just want to meet you again♫

408
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,510

♫I am so lucky♫

410
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,790
I hid it from you first.

♫You did not give up♫

412
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,000

♫You'll show me the world♫

414
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,150
Think about it.

415
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,350
When we were renovating Tongtong and grandma's house,

416
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,900
♫But I can't guess our ending♫

417
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,110
was I a princess or an architect?

418
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,410
♫I want to be a butterfly♫

419
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,390
When in Huan Cai House, in Earthly Inn,

I am a princess in the palace.

But now I'm out,

428
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,570
♫Even if only a drop♫

429
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,110
I'm just an architect.

♫A drop, a drop♫

431
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,790
But everyone

432
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,190
thinks that a princess shouldn't be doing this kind of things.

433
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,660
♫A drop of love is left♫

434
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,870

♫I would love to♫

436

It's not that I don't understand.

437

It’s just that in such a short time

438
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,830
I can't accept it.

439
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,190
I knew you were hiding something from me.

440
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,150
I was anxious and angry.

441
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,500
♫How many times I miss you at night♫

442
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,510

♫All I say in my sleep is your name♫

444
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,350
But the advent of He Zhigu

445

made me realize that I shouldn't be like this.

00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,570
♫I feel so safe♫

447
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,310

♫My dreams are all about you♫

449

Does your head still hurt?

496
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,180
You shouldn't have gotten stoned for me.

497
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,110
I practiced Iron Head when I was young.

498
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,150
My head is harder than the stone.

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,830
But you bled a lot.

500
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,350
I only practiced for three days.

501

I'm still not that good.

502
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,310
You are so silly.

503
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,990
I only practiced for three days not because I was silly.

504
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,790
I'm very smart.

505
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,430
I was just too lazy to practice.

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,110
I just mean...

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,790
Stop sighing.

509
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,310
It sounds like I'm dying.

510
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,830
Don’t talk like that.

511
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,230
OK, I won't.

512
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,910
You need to rest.

513
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,790
Close your eyes and rest.

514
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,310

Come in.

520
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,310
Listen to me.

521
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,230
I have an idea.

522
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,230
Really?

523
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,550
Don't forget that I'm a princess.

524
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,070
You've already told me that.

525
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,710
No matter who you are...

526
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,270
You silly.

527
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,110
You don't care about the identity of the princess,

528
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,150
but others do.

529
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,230
What do you mean?

530
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,870
Sir.

531
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,270
Wake up. It’s time to take medicine.

532
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,910
I don't want to.

533
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,750
What's wrong?

534
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,990
Do you feel uncomfortable after taking this medicine?

535
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,390
This medicine is too bitter.

536
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,830
Effective medicine's always bitter.

537
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,870
You have to drink it.

538
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,310
You don’t have strength?

539
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,350
My mission today

540
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,550
is to watch you drink this medicine.

541
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,750
They all went to the government office.

542
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,070
The task Architect Li left to me is to take care of you.

543
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,630
So it's just a mission.

544
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,030
Not entirely.

545
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,910
They went to the government office?

546
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,900
They've figured out a solution?

547
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,030
Her Lady has figured out a way to persuade the chiefs

548
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,030
to bomb the mountain and get the stones.

549
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,510
Give me the medicine.

550
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,470
I need to get better soon.

551
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,910
Without me as the general director,

552
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,190
how do they start work?

553
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,590
You...

554
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,500
Why do you suddenly have strength?

555
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,430
I just took a sip.

556
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,030
Then I suddenly got strength.

557
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,320
[Honest and Justice]

558
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,870

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,510
You look down on me.

748
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,190
Guys, follow me.

749
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,710
OK! OK! OK!

750
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,270
Let's get started.

751
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,110
OK. Get to work.

752
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,270
What about me?

753
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,630
Since I'm here,

754
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,430
I can't stay in the government office without doing anything.

755
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,580
After the wooden bridge is torn down,

756
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,150
the only way left

757
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,030
is a narrow meandering footpath that is a dozen miles away.

758
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,750
So I plan to set up two single cableways downstream.

759
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,740
And one is needed to supervise this project.

760
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,390
If you are willing,

761
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,750
you can do this job.

762
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,670
I am willing to do it.

763
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,630
That's great. We can start the project.

764
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,470
OK.

765
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,500
Be careful.

766
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,710
Hold it tight.

767
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,270
Come on. Up.

768
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,270
After finishing this part,

769
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,230
you can go over there.

770
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,590
Get it a bit tighter here.

771
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,150
Here.

772
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,430
The distance of these two pits is 6 feet.

773
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,590
If we shoot the arrow to the opposite side while standing in the middle,

774
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,430
we can know the exact location on the opposite side to dig the hole.

775
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,750
Come on, Wang Sheng.

776
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,750
It’s time to show your archery.

777
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,390
Bravo!

778
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,260
Bravo! Bravo!

779
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,750
Qingfeng, the bamboo raft is ready.

780
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,790
It can go into the water anytime.

781
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,750
OK, do it.

782
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,150
Get the bamboo raft into the water.

783
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,270
Get the bamboo raft into the water!

784
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,940
Into the water!

785
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,710
One, two.

786
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,550
One, two.

787
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,220
One, two.

788
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,870
One, two.

789
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,870
Great!

790
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,030
Tell me if the food is not enough.

791
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,270
Come on.

792
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,150
Have some more.

793
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,110
Your Highness. Your Highness.

794
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,540
I'm late.

795
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,310
Lord Zhou.

796
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,670
This is the food specially prepared for you.

797
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,790
Have a taste and see if you like them.

798
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,550
Don't eat this.

799
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,430
Thank you, Lord Zhou.

800
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,100
I'll just eat this.

801
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,510
You can share these dishes with the villagers.

802
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,230
Well...

803
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,910
For they are working so hard.

804
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,550
Besides,

805
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,670
since I'm here to work,

806
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,750
just like everyone else,

807
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,310
you don't have to take special care of me in the future.

808
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,030
You are a noble princess.

809
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,670
I dare not do so.

810
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,230
Are you going to listen to me or not?

811
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,470
Of course I will.

812
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,630
Yes, your Highness.

813
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,420
I shall take my leave.

814
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,990
This is the extra meal arranged by Her Highness.

815
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,390
Thank you, your Highness.

816
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,990
You're welcome. Eat more.

817
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,910
Master, this...

818
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,870
Maybe you can leave some shrimps for us next time.

819
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,430
You're so greedy.

820
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,630
Miss Zhao.

821
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,510
How is it? Are you used to it?

822
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,150
I think it's better than

823
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,750
the dishes my cook makes.

824
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,870
What are you doing?

825
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,270
You are someone else's princess,

826
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,110
but you are my Langyue.

827
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,270
Li Qingfeng, you're so disgusting.

828
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,310
It’s just a few pieces of meat.

829
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,430
Master, I'll give you mine too.

830
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,710
You should eat more yourself.

831
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,110
You've been working hard lately.

832
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,270
Thank you, Master.

833
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,470
Be careful.

834
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,550
Come on. Push over there.

835
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,950
Come on.

836
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,670
Push harder. Harder.

837
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,430
Hold it tight.

838
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,270
Are you tired?

839
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,270
No.

840
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,740
Greetings, your Highness.

841
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,270
Lord Situ.

842
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,670
Your Highness, His Majesty ordered you

843
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,550
to go back to the palace immediately.

844
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,020
The bridge is not finished yet.

845
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,750
I won't go back.

846
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,990
But the Northern Zhou has pressed us for many times.

847
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,550
It has nothing to do with me.

848
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,510
Tie me up and take me back if you dare.

849
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,030
I dare not.

850
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,310
But

851
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,950
Li Qing Feng's father, Li Jie,

852
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,660
Luo Ye's father, Luo Shengqing,

853
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,310
Han Niaoniao's father, Han Zhongzheng,

854
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,030
Mr. Meng and Zhao Xian

855
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,190
will all try their best

856
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,430
to persuade your Highness in a few days.

857
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,670
How dare you put one finger on them?

858
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,510
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

859
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,590
They are all alright.

860
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,750
All done.

861
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,790
Hurry up over there!

862
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,670
Come, come, come. Over here.

863
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,990
Come over here.

864
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,750
OK.

865
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,710
When things here in Jinnan are over, I'll go back to the palace.

866
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,590
We should go right now.

867
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,670
I have told you.

868
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,390
I will go back to the palace after things here in Jinnan are done.

869
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,310
I will report to His Majesty now.

870
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,590
Be careful.

871
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,310
Be careful.

872
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,310
Put it here. Slowly.

873
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,030
Here, here. Put it here.

874
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,630
Put it here. Here.

875
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,390
Your Highness.

876
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,830
Although I work for His Majesty,

877
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,030
from the beginning to the end,

878
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,350
I never wanted you to get married for political connection.

879
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,630
If I hide my identity

880
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,510
and never return to the palace,

881
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,950
will you stop me?

882
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,750
No.

883
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,790
However

884
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,180
the whole country belongs to His Majesty.

885
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,070
Because

886
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,790
hope is just hope.

887
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,070
Don't worry.

888
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,990
I know people are staring at me.

889
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,590
I won't do stupid things.

890
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,990
Slowly. Here, here.

891
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,230
Put it here. You can just put it here.

892
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,750
Here.

893
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,240
# [Impartiality and Integrity]

894
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,390
What are you thinking about?

895
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,870
Nothing.

896
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,380
I just need some fresh air.

897
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,030
Do you have something on your mind?

898
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,470
I just think that

899
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,710
time flies so fast.

900
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,830
It's been more than half a year since I came to the Wood Feather House.

901
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,030
Now as I think about it,

902
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,470
everything

903
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,070
and everyone are still vivid in my mind.

904
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,350
Li Qingfeng,

905
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,700
meeting you

906
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,430
was the best thing that ever happened to me.
