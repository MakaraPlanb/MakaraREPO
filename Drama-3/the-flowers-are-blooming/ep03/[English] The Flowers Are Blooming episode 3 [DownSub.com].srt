4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,539
Grandma, don't worry.

5
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,310
The meat shop robbed by the butcher has been returned to Master Liu.

6
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,190
You will never be bullied by him again.

7
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,630
Have a taste.

8
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,390
Thank you for

9
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,509
getting my money back.

10
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,750
Grandma, you're welcome.

11
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,670
Sit down.

12
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,229
Grandma, eat it.

13
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,820
It's delicious. Eat up.

14
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,259
Tongtong, you eat first.

15
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,470
Grandma, you eat first.

16
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,990
It's sweet. Eat it.

17
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,270
Grandma. Eat it.

18
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,310
Tongtong, here you are.

19
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,590
Tongtong, you are so nice.

20
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,310
Li Qingfeng.

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,750
Have a taste.

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,750
Thank you for saving me just now.

23
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,670
You are poor at martial arts,

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,620
so don't act like a hero in the future.

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,829
Let's start measuring.

26
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,950
Is it good?

27
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,550
You...

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,540
Poor at martial arts?

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,110
If I don't get outrageous, you would think I am weak.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,070
My Lady.

31
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,030
Come on.

32
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,670
I think you're thirsty. Come here.

33
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,110
Thank you. Thank you, grandma.

34
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,100
Come on.

35
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,590
Thank you.

36
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,590
Grandma.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,390
The house has been measured.

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,390
We can start to work tomorrow.

39
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,190
I have nothing to serve you here.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,790
Thank you so much.

41
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,940
Grandma.

42
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,950
This is what we should do.

43
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,470
Maybe I made some merits in my previous life,

44
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,310
so I met you.

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,590
By the way, grandma,

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,470
there's one more thing.

47
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,070
After the renovation starts,

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,270
You and Tongtong can stay in the Wood Feather House for a few days.

49
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,550
Pack your bags tonight.

50
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,470
OK.

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,150
I'll listen to you.

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm coming.

53
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,390
What are you doing?

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,420
Draw a draft.

55
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,670
This is where I work.

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,910
This is where architects work.

57
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,350
I'm also an architect.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,190
Where else can I go?

59
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,350
The roof?

60
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,350
You just need to summarize the data to me.

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,910
I can draw the draft myself.

62
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,910
I'm the deputy architect.

63
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,750
We need to finish the draft together.

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,630
Come on.

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,230
Architect Li, do you have any idea of renovation?

66
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,590
No.

67
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,990
Your draft is too simple.

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,230
The structure is similar to the original one.

69
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,470
This is a repair at best.

70
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,710
It's not a renovation.

71
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,470
We didn't get a penny from this job.

72
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,070
Therefore, the renovation should be simple.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,660
Just renovate the house with materials on hand

74
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,420
and add a little furniture.

75
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,870
No way.

76
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,830
Isn't that what

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,750
any team of craftsmen could do?

78
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,350
I think

79
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,340
We should try to be different

80
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,750
to create a unique style of Wood Feather House.

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,630
Didn’t Mr. Luo also say that?

82
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,070
Use this work

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,790
to give Wood Feather House a good sign.

84
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,150
In this case,

85
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,950
Tongtong and Grandma

86
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,710
can have a new experience.

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,190
Grandma has lived here for years,

88
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,190
and she is more accustomed to living here than experiencing life.

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,110
It is because they have lived here for years

90
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,020
that it is necessary to change their habits.

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,190
and create a new experience for them.

92
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,510
Otherwise, what's the meaning of the renovation?

93
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,870
You have nothing to say, right?

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,790
Am I right?

95
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,909
Guys,

96
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,909
are you busy?

97
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,670
Wang Sheng and I

98
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,070
ordered wine and food at Drunken Immortal Restaurant

99
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,659
to celebrate our successful start.

100
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,510
Let's eat at the restaurant.

101
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,550
That's great. I'm starving.

102
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,550
Don't you think there's something strange?

103
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,550
What's strange?

104
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,870
You never allowed people to

105
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,510
get into Wood Feather Pavilion easily before.

106
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,190
Look at you.

107
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,630
Can you at least respect me?

108
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,390
Cheers! Cheers!

109
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,870
I'll drink all of it.

110
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,670
Let me tell you.

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,150
Try this.

112
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,470
I'm really good at carving.

113
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,670
What I carved was a piece of art.

114
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,980
I'll show you next time.

115
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,670
Okay. Okay.

116
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,350
Come on. Drink more. Drink more.

117
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,630
Come on. Cheers.

118
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,350
Architect Li, you ran out to avoid drinking?

119
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,740
It's so noisy inside.

120
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,670
I'm not used to it.

121
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,550
You don't like Meng Yuanxu?

122
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,110
I didn't mean that.

123
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,510
He is quite forthright and sincere.

124
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,950
I just can't get along well with noisy people.

125
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,630

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,980
If Boss Luo hadn't persuade you,

191
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,180
you certainly wouldn't want to take it over, would you?

192
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,460
OK, OK.

193
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,980
I want to see how capable the deputy architect is.

194
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,630
How about this?

195
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,830
We will draw the draft separately tomorrow.

196
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,750
Then let everyone vote for us tomorrow.

197
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,350
What do you think?

198
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,190
Why are you laughing?

199
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,390
You throw in the towel?

200
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Flashy.

201
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,470
You must be jealous of my exquisite drawing.

202
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,190
Stop peeking.

203
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,470
Watch your steps.

204
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,030
Come on.

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
-We'll drink it all. -OK.

206
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,710
Drink it! Drink it!

207
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,700
-Drink it. -Be careful.

208
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,350
Let's go.

209
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,430
Li Qingfeng.

210
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,020
It's too cold in your room.

211
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,590
I'm gonna go back to my room.

212
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,190
It's really cold.

213
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,670
I think

214
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,190
you'd better cherish Miss Zhao.

215
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,070
What do you mean?

216
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,590
I'm afraid you won't have a good relationship anymore.

217
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,190
Can you tell fortune?

218
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,190
Yes.

219
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,070
I can tell you that you will lose to me tomorrow.

220
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,190
Goodbye.

221
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,600
[Wood Feather House]

222
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,550
Master, this is for you.

223
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,950
What are you doing? You scared me.

224
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,830
I spent the whole afternoon

225
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,470
buying you a wooden box yesterday.

226
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,550
It's for your tools.

227
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,300
Really?

228
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,630
Look.

229
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,180
Let me see.

230
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,910
Interesting.

231
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,590
Of course.

232
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,630
This is the most special one

233
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,830
in Lin'an City.

234
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,660
I asked a lot of people to buy it for you.

235
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,190
Look.

236
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,790
The mechanism inside is exquisite.

237
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,910
Good design.

238
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,620
This wood is great,

239
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,590
right?

240
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,070
Yes, yes.

241
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,430
Do you like it?

242
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,310
You're really my good apprentice.

243
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,070
I like it.

244
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,180
I'm glad you like it.

245
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,550
Not bad.

246
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,030
Li Qingfeng.

247
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,030
No way.

248
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,750
I'm here.

249
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,590
What is this?

250
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,070
That's right.

251
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,190
You made it. So what?

252
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,190
I got it,

253
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,230
so it's my box.

254
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,670
Of course.

255
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,790
This chair is so interesting.

256
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,790
It seems that you

257
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,910
have a leisurely and carefree mood.

258
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,470
It was made especially for you.

259
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,510
Why?

260
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,590
I'm afraid you'll fall again and say I don't pull you up.

261
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,150
It seems that I can never

262
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,110
hear anything nice from you.

263
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,030
I really don't know what Miss Zhao

264
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,000
likes about you.

265
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,310
Boss, you're here.

266
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,510
You may leave now.

267
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,750
Okay.

268
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,350
Boss, I've brought the ledger.

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,230
Take a look.

270
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,940
I've put the budget

271
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,710
to the lowest.

272
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,990
Have a look.

273
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,790
Later,

274
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,830
I'll tell you the details.

275
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,190
I don't care about this.

276
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,150
Tell me clearly.

277
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,430
What did Miss Chen do?

278
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,710
Why did she offend Li Qingfeng like this?

279
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,510
To be honest,

280
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,830
I don't know either.

281
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,710
But Qingfeng once said that

282
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,590
he will let her leave as soon as all positions are filled.

283
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,510
I don't think it'll take long.

284
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,350
No.

285
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,190
I'm going to vote at noon.

286
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,150
I'd like to see

287
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,110
what this deputy architect is up to.

288
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,030
Next, everyone can

289
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,110
vote according to your wish.

290
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,310
I'll count to three.

291
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,750
Think about it.

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,870
One.

293
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,990
Two.

294
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,110
Three.

295
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,270
You can vote now.

296
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,990
A tie.

297
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,790
Come here.

298
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,710
Wang Sheng, I…

299
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,270
You...

300
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,030
You...

301
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,310
Did I win?

302
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,310
Forget it.

303
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,940
This voting is not fair at all.

304
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,790
Li Qingfeng is an architect of Wood Feather House.

305
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,550
I invested because of him.

306
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,510
We can't just take sides

307
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,750
and then dismiss him.

308
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,110
I saw your draft.

309
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,070
The appearance is not practical,

310
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,790
and it's also against the whole environment.

311
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,390
The life of Grandma and Tongtong

312
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,870
will be very inconvenient.

313
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,150
Who says that the restoration of the house

314
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,740
can't pursue the exquisite appearance?

315
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,630
Grandma has lived a hard life.

316
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,310
-Why can't she live in a better place? -Right.

317
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,780
If you go back on your word as the boss,

318
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,100
if you don't admit that I win,

319
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,190
then I have nothing to say.

320
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,310
Boss Luo.

321
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,150
We can see the voting result.

322
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,110
It's up to you.

323
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,550
Forget it.

324
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,710
You'll be the architect this time.

325
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,590
Really?

326
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,670
But if any accident happens,

327
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,710
you have to take full responsibility.

328
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,340
You are so narrow-minded.

329
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,390
You pretended to ask my master to be the architect,

330
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,590
but you added such a condition.

331
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,470
Are you threatening us?

332
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,870
OK.

333
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,950
Architect Li, it's a deal.

334
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,630
You can assign the work.

335
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,430
OK.

336
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,830
All the details of the construction

337
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,550
should be based on my draft.

338
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,550
Li Qingfeng, I'm the biggest boss of Wood Feather House.

339
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,590
As long as you want,

340
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,310
I can get Miss Chen

341
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,310
out of the Wood Feather House.

342
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,300
No need.

343
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,030
But you are the architect!

344
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,030
I have explained in the meeting hall.

345
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,630
Let me see

346
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,590
what Deputy Architect Chen can do.

347
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,470
OK.

348
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,270
Anyway,

349
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,750
I will be on your side.

350
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,670
I'm here to get my box.

351
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,190
Miss Zhao,

352
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,819
we'll get to work soon.

353
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,910
If you have nothing to say, please leave.

354
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,869
OK. I’ll leave you to work.

355
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,270
I'll go to Tongtong's home to find you later.

356
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,869
Miss Zhao didn't know that the chair had a round bottom,

357
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,710
so she didn't sit still.

358
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,860
Why would you explain that to me?

359
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,230
Let's go to work.

360
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,510
My lady, be careful.

361
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,550
Okay.

362
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,310
Li Qingfeng, did you do it on purpose?

363
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,550
If I lay the grass like you did,

364
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,550
when will we be able to finish it?

365
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,150
I think you just refuse to accept the truth.

366
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,590
How can I accept it?

367
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,870
So straightforward.

368
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,470
Why are you helping me if you don't accept it?

369
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,590
I'm from the Wood Feather House.

370
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm not trying to help you.

371
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,270
By the way,

372
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,300
I noticed a lot of details missing

373
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,670
in your draft.

374
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,230
You drew the roof,

375
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,990
but you ignored the beams in the roof.

376
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,310
This house hasn't been repaired for years.

377
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,670
We need to add some wooden wedges.

378
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,910
Nonsense.

379
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,830
Isn't it stable?

380
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,550
Be careful.

381
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,550
I don't think the wooden structure is stable.

382
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,870
Come closer.

383
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,110
My Lady.

384
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,990
Do you still think it's stable?

385
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,630
Let me down.

386
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,620
Where are you going?

387
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,710
I'm going to make wooden wedges.

388
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,070
Be careful.

389
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,310
My Lady. Are you all right?

390
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,230
You scared me. My lady.

391
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,030
I'm back.

392
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,630
Master, are you thirsty?

393
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,310
Come and eat watermelon.

394
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,630
Li Qingfeng, come down and eat watermelon.

395
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Whatever.

396
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,350
Master, Luo.

397
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,390
I'll cut watermelon for you.

398
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm busy.

399
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,390
Get me some wood sticks.

400
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,470
I want to make some wooden wedges.

401
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,340
Master, don't be so serious.

402
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,100
It won't take much time to eat watermelon.

403
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,790
What do you mean by "won't take much time"?

404
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,110
This is my job.

405
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,230
You eat watermelon now

406
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,030
and you go to the toilet...

407
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,270
When will the work be finished?

408
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,230
Painting walls is boring.

409
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,870
Besides, the two painters I hired

410
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,870
are good at painting.

411
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,230
I don't need to do it.

412
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,390
You've never done such rough work before.

413
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,470
My heart aches when you do it.

414
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,750
Just take a rest and leave the work to me.

415
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,550
If you are free,

416
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,710
help Architect Li.

417
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,100
That's the rough work.

418
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,510
I don't like him.

419
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,590
What do you mean?

420
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,870
I always feel that he is my love rival.

421
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,390
Nonsense!

422
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,950
Master, didn't you notice?

423
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,950
He doesn't do his job well

424
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,070
and looks at you all the time.

425
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,790
You are the one who doesn't do your job wll

426
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,990
and looks at him all the time.

427
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,590
All right.

428
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,630
Get me some wood sticks.

429
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,700
OK.

430
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,390
Architect Chen.

431
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,510
We're back.

432
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,830
The materials are ready. Go and have a look.

433
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,270
OK.

434
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,860
Architect Li, come down.

435
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,630
Here are the materials.

436
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,270
Miss Chen.

437
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,190
Boss Luo told me everything.

438
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,020
Thank you for the thing about butcher Zhang.

439
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,310
It's nothing.

440
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,590
I promised you.

441
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,750
I've said it many times,

442
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,230
but seeing everyone

443
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,030
busy for grandma and Tongtong,

444
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,990
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you.

445
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,710
You should thank architect Chen.

446
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,950
All the drafts

447
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,070
are all painted by Architect Chen.

448
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,790
If she hadn't persuaded Qingfeng,

449
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,110
we wouldn't have started to work.

450
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,060
Boss Luo, aren't you the one who persuaded him?

451
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,350
You persuaded him.

452
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,110
Me?

453
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,590
The materials are all here and everyone is back.

454
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,510
Miss Han.

455
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,230
Luo has a record of our work today.

456
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,510
She also has the drafts of architect Chen.

457
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,140
Check it with Luo

458
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,510
and report to the Ministry of Works as soon as possible.

459
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,230
Okay.

460
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,030
I persuaded him?

461
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,830
-And that one. -Li Qingfeng,

462
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,630
Come down.

463
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,430
Miss Zhao, what's the matter?

464
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,190
Emergency! Come down!

465
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,670
If there's nothing urgent,

466
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,350
I'll build the roof first.

467
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,070
How long do you want me to wait?

468
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,020
Architect Li, come down.

469
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,590
During work,

470
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,150
it's my principle not to do anything irrelevant.

471
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,590
You have your principles,

472
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,910
but this is a matter of etiquette.

473
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,060
Do you want Miss Zhao

474
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,350
to wait for you over there?

475
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,870
I heard from Boss Luo that

476
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,630
when you worked, you'd forget to sleep and eat.

477
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,390
I know you're stubborn and it's useless to persuade you.

478
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,630
So I looked for a dim sum chef of the Zhang's

479
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,230
to learn this Spring Duck Cake from him.

480
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,390
Your favorite dessert.

481
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,550
I brought it specially for you.

482
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,710
Mr. Luo will arrange the meal.

483
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,350
You don't have to bring it here.

484
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,510
This dessert is different.

485
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,590
It tastes the same even when it's cold.

486
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,110
If you are busy with your work

487
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,550
and forget to eat it, it won't affect the taste.

488
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,270
The ingredients are also good for your health.

489
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,190
Have a taste.

490
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,590
Miss Zhao, did you prepare anything for us?

491
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,390
I'm really hungry now.

492
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,390
If you are hungry,

493
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,990
I can lend you some copper cash

494
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,030
to buy some steamed buns. They can also fill your stomach.

495
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,350
Miss Zhao,

496
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,590
are you calling me a beggar?

497
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,070
Miss Zhao, you made all these yourself?

498
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,030
I'm just a beginner.

499
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,100
Aren't these Spring Duck Cakes?

500
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,710
I like...

501
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,470
Have a taste.

502
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,790
If you like it, I'll make it for you again in the future.

503
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,110
Is it good?

504
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,350
Do you want another one?

505
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,550
No need.

506
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,870
One piece is enough for me.

507
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,990
Share the rest

508
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,110
with everyone.

509
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,110
Great! Great! I knew it!

510
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,870
Come on.

511
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,110
Official, official.

512
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,750
Let's share. Let's share.

513
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,350
Wang Sheng, this is yours.

514
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,630
Here you are.

515
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,540
It looks delicious.

516
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,390
It looks good.

517
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,230
Delicious.

518
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,910
Why is it so bad?

519
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,340
Li Qingfeng, you are so scheming.

520
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,350
Qingfeng. You weren't like this before. You've changed.

521
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,990
Are you exaggerating?

522
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,470
Qingfeng said it was delicious.

523
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,150
Since you've tried so hard,

524
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,430
I could have one.

525
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,070
But... don't do such things again.

526
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,420
Hurry up. Water.

527
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,270
Let's go.

528
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,590
Let's go.

529
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,870
I'm exhausted.

530
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,590
At today's rate,

531
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,470
we can finish the work

532
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,950
in less than 3 days.

533
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,430
At today's rate,

534
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,510
I will die of overwork in less than 3 days.

535
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,270
Thank you.

536
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,750
Thank you for your hard work today.

537
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,430
Luo has gone to the kitchen to cook.

538
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,830
I'll go help her now.

539
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,550
We'll make more dishes today

540
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,830
to reward all of you.

541
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,310
Boss Luo, the ingredients are missing.

542
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,510
What?

543
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,830
What do you mean by "the ingredients are missing"?

544
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,070
I just went to the kitchen.

545
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,590
The ingredients we left are missing,

546
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,110
but the kitchen is clean.

547
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,910
Never mind.

548
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,550
I will buy everyone a meal at Drunken Immortal Restaurant.

549
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,870
You're back.

550
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,270
Grandma! Grandma!

551
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,070
I didn't know what I can do for you.

552
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,500
I saw some ingredients in the kitchen,

553
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,110
so I cooked some dishes.

554
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,430
If you don't mind,

555
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,750
go and have a taste.

556
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,070
Of course we don't mind.

557
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,510
We should be grateful.

558
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,310
I know why I smelled something good when I entered the door.

559
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,270
I think I smelled shrimps.

560
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,630
As long as you don't mind,

561
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,430
go and eat.

562
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,750
-Let's go. -Let's go.

563
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,190
Wang Sheng, let’s go.

564
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,670
Come on.

565
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,780
This is my bowl.

566
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,510
Weird.

567
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,790
Personal privilege.

568
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,620
Grandma, it's

569
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,500
so delicious.

570
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,700
It's just a simple meal.

571
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,590
I'm afraid that you'd not be used to it.

572
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,470
Of course not.

573
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,630
I'm starving to death.

574
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,470
It's good.

575
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,430
Master, eat more.

576
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,500
Come on.

577
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,670
Tongtong, eat more.

578
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,310
Thank you, sis.

579
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,390
Grandma, why don't you eat?

580
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,230
I'm eating.

581
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,900
Girl, eat more.

582
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,390
Here.

583
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,980
-Eat more. -Thank you, grandma.

584
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,310
Have some snacks.

585
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,550
OK.

586
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,510
Sis.

587
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,750
Tongtong, come here.

588
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,030
Li Qingfeng.

589
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,630
Miss Chen.

590
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,590
Grandma, you didn't eat much just now.

591
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,790
So I brought some snacks.

592
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,390
Look, I made you worry about me again.

593
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,630
Are these from you?

594
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,550
Miss Chen.

595
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,630
You and Architect Li

596
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,950
are thoughtful and kind.

597
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,910
I'm unable to repay your kindness.

598
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,350
Grandma.

599
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,670
You are a guest.

600
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,630
You live here, so we should take care of you.

601
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,110
Don't think too much.

602
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,230
Have a good rest.

603
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,630
You can go home in 7 days.

604
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,590
Okay. Okay.

605
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,510
Yes, grandma.

606
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,590
Don't say thanks anymore.

607
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,590
Tongtong,

608
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,510
if grandma doesn't eat again,

609
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,980
come and tell me, okay?

610
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,630
I know.

611
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,870
Good girl.

612
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,310
Li Qingfeng.

613
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,230
Sometimes,

614
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,110
I really don't know what you're thinking.

615
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,100
What?

616
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,950
Nothing.

617
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,990
Why do you need to know what I'm thinking?

618
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,750
You...

619
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,510
You heard it. Why are you asking me?

620
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,710
What do you mean by "oh"?

621
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,390
Nothing.

622
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,740
Nothing? Just say it.

623
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,190
So you know,

624
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,310
When I asked you something

625
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,350
and you said it was nothing,

626
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,990
I was feeling exactly what you're feeling right now.

627
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,950
You're so stingy.

628
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,620
I suddenly remembered something.

629
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,550
In your draft,

630
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,830
I don't think there's a method of heating in winter.

631
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,750
A method of heating in winter?

632
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,300
Although it's not written in Rules of Architecture,

633
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,110
rules are formed among the folk craftsmen team.

634
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,950
Most houses are built in summer,

635
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,430
but we can't ignore the heating in winter.

636
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,070
There are 3 ways to keep warm.

637
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,110
First, use a stove.

638
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,150
However, this room is too small

639
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,550
to build a stove.

640
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,390
Second, use a brazier.

641
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,190
However, grandma is old,

642
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,030
and Tongtong is too young.

643
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,070
If they light the brazier every day,

644
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,790
it will be very dangerous.

645
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,390
Third, build a hot wall.

646
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,790
But this project is huge.

647
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,460
It will almost need to rebuild the house.

648
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,310
So we can't do it.

649
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,590
Then what should we do?

650
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,710
You're the architect.

651
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,390
You should think about it yourself.

652
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,070
You...

653
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,710
You are so hot-hearted,

654
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,870
but why do you always pretend to be cold?

655
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,390
I was born to be like this.

656
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,270
Then tell me,

657
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,470
why did you agree to take this job?

658
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,470
Mr. Luo.

659
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,310
Boss Luo?

660
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,950
I have to behave well to be an architect.

661
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,780
I also hope

662
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,710
you can be a good architect in terms of this work.

663
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,310
I won't let you laugh at me.

664
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,460
Master, I bought the bricks.

665
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,910
Look. Are these what you want?

666
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,300
Not bad.

667
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,830
Unload them.

668
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,230
OK.

669
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,910
Wait.

670
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,750
Are you sure you want to use narrow bricks?

671
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,780
Big narrow bricks of 1.3 chi.

672
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,870
The quality and color are all good. What's wrong?

673
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,990
Return it.

674
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,150
What?

675
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,750
Li Qingfeng. What did you say?

676
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,350
I carefully selected

677
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,670
and brought them back.

678
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,190
Grandma's yard is not suitable for narrow bricks.

679
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,510
Why?

680
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,070
This brick is flashy.

681
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,950
Flashy?

682
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,070
Why is it flashy?

683
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,670
You've seen my draft.

684
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,190
If there was any problem, why didn't you tell me?

685
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,710
It was not clear in the draft what kind of bricks you would use.

686
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,510
I thought you were going to use Huangdao brick.

687
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,990
What is Huangdao brick? I've never heard of it.

688
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,350
It's also called Zhenzi brick.

689
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,340
Never heard of it.

690
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,790
I think it would be great

691
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,830
to pave the ground with large narrow bricks.

692
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,270
I don't think it's flashy.

693
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,870
I am the architect.

694
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,550
This work reflects my style.

695
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,470
It won't be my style if I change it.

696
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,110
Why didn't you tell me sooner or later?

697
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,470
Why are you against me now?

698
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,070
You are making people laugh at me.

699
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,390
My Lady.

700
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,470
Don't follow me.

701
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,270
Li Qingfeng.

702
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,910
Does the type of brick matter so much?

703
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,190
Change it.

704
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,670
Change it to Huangdao brick.

705
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,910
You can change it yourself.

706
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,710
I'm busy.

707
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,310
Qingfeng.

708
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,990
Do you have anything to say?

709
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,270
Of course I know you.

710
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm just worried about Miss Chen.

711
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,590
This place is remote.

712
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,350
If there are gangsters here...

713
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,990
If something happens...

714
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,110
Architect Li,

715
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,430
I know you don't trust my lady.

716
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,030
But she really values this job.

717
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,950
She really wants to do well.

718
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,630
Mr. Luo, change the bricks.

719
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,950
I'll find her.

720
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,140
Don't worry. I'm here.

721
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,190
What are you doing here?

722
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,590
Narrow bricks are used for the attics and pavilions.

723
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,390
The sewer system of attic and pavilion

724
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,590
is generally perfect.

725
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,630
But Tongtong's house is different.

726
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,830
The terrain is low.

727
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,910
When it rains, the rainwater will be piled up.

728
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,630
Second,

729
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,230
As time goes by, there will be many holes.

730
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,630
Huangdao bricks are different.

731
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,580
This type of brick fits well and has a high density.

732
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,710
It can effectively avoid these problems.

733
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,430
Are you teaching me a lesson or showing off how much you know?

734
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm apologizing.

735
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,870
I've never seen anyone apologize like this.

736
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,590
But this is the only way I can apologize.

737
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,830
Do you know?

738
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,310
I hate people saying I'm flashy.

739
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,230
I thought the construction

740
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,670
could be unconventional

741
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,270
and creative,

742
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,390
but I didn't expect

743
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,430
to be said flashy.

744
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,270
People started to say I was flashy,

745
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,110
and in the end even you said the same thing about me.

746
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,310
Narrow bricks have elegant appearance,

747
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:09,910
but...

748
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,110
I know. You said it just now.

749
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,630
Compared with the appearance of the building,

750
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,630
the feeling of people living in it

751
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,470
is more important than anything else.

752
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,190
That's what grandma taught us.

753
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,270
Safety is more

754
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,340
important than beauty.

755
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,100
Am I right?

756
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,270
Now you've learned that well.

757
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,750
So,

758
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,510
you're not angry anymore?

759
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,150
It's not that easy.

760
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,550
Actually, I recognize your talent.

761
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,430
Didn't you always say that my draft

762
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,550
was flashy?

763
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,870
If that's the case,

764
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,700
I wouldn't agree with

765
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,430
your draft anyway.

766
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,630
In fact,

767
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,790
you've done a good job.

768
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,190
Now you know how to praise people.

769
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm also learning things that I don't know how to do.

770
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,310
What do you mean?

771
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,670
I didn't know how to apologize.

772
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,830
I didn't know how to explain.

773
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,670
I didn't know how to praise others.

774
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,470
I think you did a good job today.

775
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,310
Really?

776
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,750
Thank you.

777
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,710
Wait.

778
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,350
Are you serious?

779
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,150
Are you practicing it on me?

780
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,510
Of course not.

781
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,340
For you.

782
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,230
Meng Yuanxu.

783
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,750
You're quite relaxed. Have you finished your work?

784
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,990
Master, do we still have to work?

785
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,350
What do you think?

786
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,910
Yes. Yes.

787
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,630
I'll do it now.

788
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,310
I'm glad you're smart. Next time...

789
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,860
Painting walls! I love painting walls.

790
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,830
Keep working.

♫Your smile is like a ripple on the corners of your mouth.♫

792

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,070
Here. Eat some fruit. I just washed it.

794
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,590
Give them some fruit.

808
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,630
I don't want to paint the walls anymore.

809
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,950
How is it?

810
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,310
My design of underground heating

811
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,670
is extraordinary, right?

812
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,190
Is it the perfect solution

813
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,310
to winter heating?

814
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,470
Underground heating is indeed brilliant.

815
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,910
And it's more practical than traditional heating methods.

816
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,470
Of course.

817
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,110
I had a revelation in my sleep

818
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,470
after thinking about it.

819
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,790
Then my mind suddenly burst into inspiration.

820
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,390
That's how I came up with such a perfect plan.

821
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,150
Actually, I also thought about underground heating before.

822
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,470
You are a Monday morning quarterback.

823
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,590
You...

824
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,470
You just don't want to admit that you are inferior to me.

825
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,710
In Wood Feather Pavilion,

826
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,710
there are many drawings of underground heating.

827
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,830
If you don't believe me, you can have a look.

828
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,950
What do you mean?

829
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,230
I just want to say that

830
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,070
the way of underground heating is indeed brilliant,

831
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,190
but it's difficult to lay the fire path.

832
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,950
Look at your draft.

833
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,470
If the fire path goes this way, although it can save time and cost,

834
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,590
it will leave a security problem.

835
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,830
What security problem?

836
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,150
Did you look at it carefully?

837
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,470
Even if I didn't look at the draft carefully,

838
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,630
I could know that there was something wrong with your draft.

839
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,180
There may be a fire in the future.

840
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,670
You are deliberately mystifying.

841
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,390
I think it's fine.

Chen Langyue.

844
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,950
You're not even afraid of your brother. Don't worry.

Li Qingfeng.

846
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,310
Li Qingfeng.

847
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,150
I see.

848
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,270
In this way,

849
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,830
the fire won't gather together.

850
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,390
It not only eliminates the security problem,

851
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,230
but also expands the scope of the underground heating.

852
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,580
Dumb.

853
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,950
Why didn't he tell me directly?

854
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,230
You took my shop away,

855
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,790
and I'll burn your house down.

856
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,950
Brother.

857
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,670
Didn't you say there's no one in this room?

858
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,670
It can't be.

859
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,470
I already know when

860
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,470
these guys get off work.

861
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,790
There must be no one inside.

862
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,070
No one?

863
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,310
That...

864
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,750
Don't be silly. Let's go.

865
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,630
Brother, if there is really someone in this room,

866
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,870
we can't set the fire.

867
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,070
Look at you.

868
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,350
Brother.

869
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,150
Someone's here. Let's go. Let's go.

870
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,270
Brother, what should we do?

871
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,910
How about we go back and come tomorrow?

872
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,590
Tomorrow comes again and again. Tomorrows are like rivers that endlessly flow.

873
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,590
Do you understand?

874
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,830
But my wife is waiting for me at home.

875
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,710
Stop it.

876
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,870
Your wife is like a starving wolf at night.

877
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,950
With your physical condition,

878
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,950
can you satisfy her?

879
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,790
My wife is...

880
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,390
How do you know...

881
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,790
You want to kill me?

882
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,950
Zhang Ganglie, what did you do?

883
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,900
Don't be silly.

884
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,710
Let me tell you.

885
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,910
If we can't take revenge tonight,

886
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,630
I won't let you go.

887
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,790
I won't kill people or set fire.

888
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,790
You seem to have learned new tricks, huh?

889
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,670
Zhang Ganglie, it's you who started it.

890
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,950
If you mess with me,

891
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,390
I'll tell everyone about tonight.

892
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,950
Dong Ergou!

893
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,460
Hit me.

894
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,670
I dare to scream if you dare to hit me.

895
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,790
Let go!

896
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,230
Coward!

897
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,470
It's good that you know your problems.

898
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,310
Don't be too proud.

899
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,230
There's something wrong with your draft.

900
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,470
You mean the height of the fire path?

901
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,790
How do you know?

902
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,310
Otherwise, why do you think I came here late at night?

903
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,430
Well.

904
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,950
You could have come in broad daylight.

905
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,950
Why do you have to come here at night?

906
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,190
Nobody disturbs me at night.

907
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,270
Save time. Save energy. Save saliva.

908
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,950
You're helping me.

909
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,710
Why do you have to make it sound so annoying?

910
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,100
Who is it?

911
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,670
Anybody here?

912
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,860
What's this?

913
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,150
Is anyone here?

914
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,390
It's fire.

915
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,710
Why is there a fire here?

916
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,510
Come with me.

917
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,950
Grandma's house is full of hay and hardwood.

918
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,910
The fire will only get bigger and bigger.

919
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,590
Wait.

920
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,430
What are you doing?

921
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,390
What are you doing?

922
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,190
Put it on.

923
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,300
We'll break down the door and go out together.

924
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,150
No, you'll get burned.

925
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,630
Let's go.
