Dad, have some tea.

Stop.

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,670
This...

7
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,630
You did it on purpose, didn’t you?

8
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,310
By the way, Ning,

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,030
why haven’t you

10
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,950
mentioned Li Qingfeng for quite some time?

11
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,229
How is he now?

12
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,230
Didn't father ask me not to mention him?

13
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,070
When did I say that?

14
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,060
I told you not to mention him so much.

15
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,669
OK. Calm down.

16
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,230
Your shoulders always get tight when you're excited.

I heard

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,510
your charity chamber

22
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,230

Li Qingfeng

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,350
must be very impressed by you.

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,390
Mr. Luo is.

28
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,950
Li Qingfeng just said something good about it.

29
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,710
In this matter,

30
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,430
I am also very impressed by you.

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,910
Li Qingfeng only said something good about it?

32
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,630
What's so great about him?

33
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,230
Li Qingfeng just doesn't ingratiate himself with other people.

34
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,070
So you mean

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,670
I ingratiate myself with others?

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,430
Father.

37
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,510
Why do you dislike Li Qingfeng so much?

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,030
Well.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,230
Because he had the nerve to refuse you.

40
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,030
That's why I hold a grudge against him.

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,910
How did you know that?

42
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,780
It wasn't your seventh brother who told me.

43
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,030
How would I know

44
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,830
something so important like this?

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,550
Right, father?

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,990
Father, have some tea.

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,430
As the saying goes, no one knows a man better than his own father.

48
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,350
Ning,

49
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,750
I know your temper

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,910
and your personality.

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,020
As long as you are determined,

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,150
no matter what others say,

53
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,390
you would never change your mind.

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,470
But I still have to tell you

55
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,350
what is needed to be told.

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,190
Since Li Qingfeng has rejected you,

57
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,510
I think you should stop getting involved with him

58
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,910
so that you won't tarnish our family's reputation

59
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,829
and your own, understand?

60
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,829
Yes.

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,670
Speaking from the bottom of my heart,

62
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,110
as long as you're sure he's the one,

63
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,390
even if I have no other choice,

64
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,350
or even if I don't want you to be with him,

65
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,350
I will

66
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,470
never stop you.

67
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,110
But it doesn't mean

see my precious daughter suffer.

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,630
So I suggest that

71
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,150
you talk it through with Li Qingfeng

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,750
as soon as possible,

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,700
and ask him to tell you what he really thinks

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,110
so that he won’t get in the way of your happiness for the rest of you life.

75
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,110
I have been looking for a chance to talk to him.

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,790
If he refuses me again,

77
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,470
then I’ll give up.

78
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,030
But if he doesn't,

79
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,980
then I’ll seize the chance

80
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,830
and that'll reassure you

81
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,150
to show you what a good daughter I am to you.

do you have any renovation plan for their dorm?

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,110
to solve the shortage of their beds.

193
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,950
Mr. Xu,

194
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,190
let's move the beds

195
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,910
into the dorm to see if they fit.

196
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,310
OK.

197
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,510
Thank you all.

198
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,470
Thank you all.

199
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,590
Architect Li. Architect Li. Architect Li.

200
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,550
Thank you, everyone.

201
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,100
Good job.

202
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,590
Mr. Xu.

203
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,110
Take a look.

204
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,590
Okay.

205
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,110
I'll have a look.

206
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,830
I'll have a look.

207
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,910
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

208
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,550
I was there for the whole working process myself.

209
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,470
I was the supervisor. They are absolutely safe.

210
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm not worried.

211
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,790
We trust you.

212
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,870
Father.

213
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,590
There are two drawers here.

214
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,470
Are they for the kids' clothes?

215
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,510
Yes.

216
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,630
You're very thoughtful.

217
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,910
There are still twelve beds like before.

218
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,550
But they only take up the space of six.

219
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,110
If we have more children,

220
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,420
we can put the beds together.

221
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,110
In this way,

222
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,550
we can save more space.

223
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,380
But if you have more children,

224
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,390
which means more beds,

225
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,350
it won't be well-ventilated enough.

226
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,990
So if it is not necessary,

227
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,670
I suggest you don't put more beds.

228
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,670
No more. They'll be enough.

229
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,550
Architect Li, you're brilliant.

230
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,870
The design really surprised me.

231
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,390
I'm so impressed.

232
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,470
I’m flattered, Mr. Xu.

233
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,510
I only came up with the idea

234
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
based on practical problems.

235
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,550
As long as I help you fix the problems,

236
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm happy.

237
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,830
Also,

238
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,710
the drawers are Miss Chen's idea.

239
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,590
Both of you are brilliant.

240
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,470
How easily you just

241
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,870
solved our problems!

242
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Thank you so much.

243
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,550
That's great.

244
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,630
On behalf of all the kids here,

245
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,220
I want to express my gratitude to Miss Zhao and the two architects.

246
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,710
Thank you so much.

247
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,430
Mr. Xu! Mr. Xu!

248
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,550
Mr. Xu. You don't have to do this.

249
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,510
You're our senior.

250
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,870
Yes.

251
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,830
You don't have to bow so often!

252
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:14,860
Mr. Xu.

253
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,180
From now on, you can see us as your family.

254
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,350
We will often come here to visit you

255
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,550
and the kids.

256
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,390
If you keep treating us as guests,

257
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,830
we wouldn't dare to come again.

258
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,950
THat's right.

259
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,060
You don't have to thank us so much, Mr. Xu.

260
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,510
We just did what we could do.

261
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,470
Right?

262
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,110
He's right.

263
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,270
You've been helping the kids for all these years

264
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,980
without asking for anything in return.

265
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,230
Everyone can see what a great and kind man you are.

266
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,350
Our contribution is nothing

267
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,590
compared with yours.

268
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,100
I'm so flattered.

269
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,190
What I've been doing means a lot to me.

270
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,870
I ask for no credits.

271
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,990
Sorry, everyone.

272
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Sorry.

273
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,990
I will bear in mind

274
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,070
your kindness.

275
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,110
Actually,

276
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,550
my father spends all his savings,

277
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,750
goes to great lengths

278
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,310
and dedicates the latter half of his life

279
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,830
to this orphanage,

280
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,510
only because he's...

281
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,550
atoning for his sin.

282
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,870
Sin?

283
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,630
Twelve years ago,

284
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
my parents

285
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,790
took my sister and me away from our hometown, Hongzhou,

286
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,150
and moved to Lin'an.

287
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,830
My father, along with my mother, sister and me,

288
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,910
traveled for more than half a month.

289
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,740
He then had no choice

290
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,270
but to abandon my sister

291
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,820
without my mother knowing

292
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,430
at the door of a family in a small town we passed by on the way.

293
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,510
My mother got sick from missing my sister.

294
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,350
She passed away in less than half a year

295
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,430
after arriving in Lin'an.

296
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,430
It was a turbulent time,

297
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,630
and my father knew

298
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,710
once he abandoned my sister,

299
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,790
we would never see her again.

300
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,940
If this is fate,

301
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,590
you can never escape.

302
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,830
But after my mother passed away,

303
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,230
he could not get over it

304
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,710
and was down for years

305
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,550
until a few years ago

306
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,310
when the imperial court set up the governmental orphanage department.

307
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,190
That's when my father seemed to have found

308
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,790
his calling.

309
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,070
Then he founded this orphanage

310
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,950
to adopt the abandoned babies and raise them.

311
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,030
My father said

312
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,990
this is his way to redeem him from sin.

313
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,980
But I know this is his way to heal himself.

314
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,510
Because during all these years,

315
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,790
I have witnessed how he has changed

316
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,230
by raising the kids.

317
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,580
I know that

318
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,430
he's getting rid of misery.

319
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,790
So no matter what,

320
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
I will stay by his side

321
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,350
and keep going together with him.

322
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,270
I didn't know that

323
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,870
there would be such a story behind you and your father.

324
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,430
Don't worry, Qi Cai.

325
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,270
I've established the Charity Chamber of Commerce.

326
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,230
From now on, I will donate to

327
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,830
civilian orphanages like yours on a regular basis.

328
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,870
You'll be our key recipient.

329
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,550
Just ask me if you need anything.

330
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,710
I will help you.

331
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,350
Yes. And also Wood Feather House.

332
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,950
All of us will come to your aid.

333
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,230
That's right.

334
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,590
Just take us as your friends and family.

335
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,270
Mr. Xu is atoning for his sin,

336
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,060
but what he does is actually a good deed.

337
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,910
From now on, we will stand by your side.

338
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,390
I will, too. At any time,

339
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm the coach of the orphanage.

340
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,950
I will protect the kids.

341
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,710
Thank you.

342
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,870
Thank you all.

343
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,990
We're really lucky to meet you.

344
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,420
Thank you.

345
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,510
Thank you so much.

346
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,230
Mr. Xu.

347
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,110
Please don't do this.

348
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,070
[Sanfu Orphanage]

349
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,510
We will visit you again.

350
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,980
Take care.

351
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,350
OK.

352
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,270
We're off.

353
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,990
OK.

354
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,430
Let's go.

355
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,740
[Sanfu Orphanage]

356
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,870
Let's go.

357
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,070
I really don't understand.

358
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,220
Why do you always like to discuss things

359
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,310
while I'm asleep?

360
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,550
What's there to discuss?

361
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,150
We just finished the work at the orphanage.

362
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,870
I wanted everyone to rest for a few more days.

363
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,630
But the reputation of Wood Feather House is still poor

364
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,750
and we can't afford to rest.

365
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,750
I ask you all here

366
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,870
to announce our next work

367
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,030
in Wood Feather House.

368
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,230
So soon?

369
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,590
What work?

370
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:35,910
Everyone,

371
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,550
this is the house we're going to renovate.

372
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,870
My lady.

373
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,150
This house is so beautiful. Does it really need renovation?

374
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,870
I don't know.

375
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,710
Councillor Zhang, this house is exquisite enough.

376
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,910
Even the fascia boards and the thresholds

377
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,260
are elaborately carved.

378
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,580
There's no point of renovation.

379
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,150
Are you sure you want to renovate it?

380
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,470
Councillor Zhang, what exactly do you want?

381
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:00,950
That's right.

382
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,950
I want to renovate this house.

383
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,589
Excuse me. I have to go.

384
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,630
Architect Li. Architect Li.

385
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,349
Please wait.

386
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,829
If you leave like this,

387
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,790
Boss Luo will be embarrassed.

388
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,980
Councillor Zhang, with all due respect,

389
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,270
first, this house is already well-decorated enough.

390
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,510
The last architect must have worked so hard on it.

391
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,910
Second, this is a new house.

392
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,340
It must have been built recently.

393
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,070
As an architect,

394
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,150
I don't have the heart to tear down

395
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,270
what another architect

396
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
put his heart in.

397
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,230
Father.

398
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,020
Fu.

399
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,030
You've got so many people here again?

400
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,630
You finished playing the zither?

401
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,110
You want to renew my house again?

402
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,430
Fu, it’s none of your business.

403
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,470
Come with me.

404
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,670
I'm so sorry to trouble you guys.

405
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,790
You can leave now. This house doesn't need renovation.

406
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,630
This is my daughter.

407
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,950
Her name is Fu.

408
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,390
Shaoqing,

409
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,150
take her to the lobby and wait for me.

410
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,310
Come, Fu.

411
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,150
Let’s go to the lobby.

412
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,710
No.

413
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,350
Father.

414
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,390
You've tried to renovate my house again and again.

415
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,030
You spent so much money and energy on it.

416
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,700
Why would you do so?

417
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,150
Fu,

418
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,150
He knows what he's doing.

419
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,630
It's just a renovation.

420
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,990
It's no big deal.

421
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,430
Maybe it's for feng shui,

422
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,750
or for it to look even better.

423
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,990
Just don’t think about it.

424
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,670
Brother!

425
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,710
Fu, don’t you trust me?

426
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,660
Be a good girl.

427
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,830
Let's go for shooting.

428
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,630
Let’s go. Come on.

429
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,870
Good girl. Let's go.

430
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,710
Councillor Zhang, your daughter seems a bit odd.

431
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,790
Meng Yuanxu, don't be rude.

432
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,510
Councillor Zhang,

433
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,830
if you have any problems,

434
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,030
just tell me.

435
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,620
That's the only way we can help you.

436
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,870
Am I going to die soon?

437
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,550
Nonsense.

438
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,110
If that's the case,

439
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,470
would I still take you to hunt?

440
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,870
Let me ask you.

441
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,630
If I'm not sick,

442
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,630
then why does father

443
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,150
repeatedly ask the doctor

444
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,910
to check on me?

445
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,470
My silly sister.

446
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,310
Dad is old now.

447
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,750
So he needs the doctor

448
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,630
to check on him.

449
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,270
That's why the doctor checked on you, too.

450
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,630
He checked on me as well.

451
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,670
The doctor said

452
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,630
both of us were in good health

453
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,110
and could live until 99.

454
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,150
Hysteria?

455
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,790
I heard of it before,

456
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,030
but I've never seen a patient of that.

457
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,270
What are the symptoms

458
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,270
of your daughter's hysteria?

459
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,630
What does it have to do with this house?

460
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,310
Fu is fine during the day.

461
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,030
But at night,

462
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,030
she's always crying that she wants to live in the most beautiful house in the world

463
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,110
instead of this one.

464
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,510
That's why

465
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,020
I have hired many architects

466
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,670
to renovate her house.

467
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,660
However,

468
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,300
Fu is still not happy with it.

469
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,790
She’d rather live

470
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,550
in the artificial hill every night

471
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,230
than step into her own room.

472
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,310
What about the other rooms?

473
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,270
Right.

474
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,550
Did you get her to live in another room?

475
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,470
I've tried all the rooms,

476
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,110
including the wood shed

477
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,710
and the inns.

478
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,540
But none of those worked.

479
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,790
Have you taken her to see a doctor?

480
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,110
Yes.

481
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,470
I've invited

482
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,390
every doctor in Lin'an except for the imperial doctors.

483
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,310
Right now,

484
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,990
the most important thing is not how to cure her hysteria.

485
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,190
In the past few months,

486
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,190
she has been living in the artificial hill or the pavilion.

487
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,950
If her hysteria breaks out and she loses her temper,

488
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,310
she won't let anyone approach her,

489
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,910
which means I can’t take care of her.

490
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,550
As her father,

491
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,390
that really breaks my heart.

492
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,430
So now, I just hope that

493
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,470
you guys can build the most beautiful house

494
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,790
that she's been asking for,

495
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,030
so that she can get some good sleep.

496
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,950
Why not try some sleeping drugs?

497
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,300
You...

498
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,310
Councillor Zhang,

499
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,470
Our chief executive is a martial artist.

500
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,430
Please don't blame him.

501
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,630
As for the renovation,

502
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,550
now that the house

503
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,870
is not the most beautiful house according to Fu,

504
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,230
I think

505
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,390
the most beautiful house

506
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,630
is not an extravagant one.

507
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,390
So we can't change it randomly.

508
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,230
How about I and Li...

509
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,630
We still need to discuss it

510
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,790
and think about a new idea.

511
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,270
How about this, Councillor Zhang,

512
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,670
could you please show us

513
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,950
all the architecture drafts before?

514
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,110
By the way,

515
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,500
could you please also tell us

516
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,950
how Miss Zhang reacted to every draft

517
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,790
briefly

518
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,030
so that we can make an analysis?

519
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,230
That makes sense, Architect Li.

520
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,910
We have never thought about it before.

521
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,270
Great!

522
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,430
Shaoqing and I will sort them out today

523
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,710
and give them to you.

524
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,790
OK, then I’ll leave now.

525
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,910
Thank you all.

526
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,190
There really is no shortage of weirdos in this world.

527
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,430
That house is even better than the one my mother lives in.

528
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,710
Why is the hysteria girl still not happy?

529
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,550
Mrs. Meng’s house is a really good one.

530
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,030
Luo, you have seen her house before?

531
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,710
No, I havn't.

532
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,470
I mentioned it to her before.

533
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,750
Anyway,

534
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,140
what happened today is unbelievable.

535
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,270
I thought

536
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,390
we could make a lot of money from him.

537
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,630
But I didn't know it would be such a tough job.

538
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,300
That's right.

539
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,390
I can’t figure out anything, either.

540
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,910
Li Qingfeng, where are you going to start?

541
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,190
We have to wait until Councillor Zhang's son

542
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,190
shows us the previous drafts,

543
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,710
so that we can decide what to do next.

544
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,510
This is the only way.

545
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,380
Let's go and have some rest.

546
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,230
Let's go.

547
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,390
Architect Chen.

548
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,300
What's wrong?

549
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,710
If Councillor Zhang's son

550
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,510
brings the drafts here,

551
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,190
could you please bring them to Wood Feather Pavilion to me

552
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,990
so that we can find out the materials,

553
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,150
structure and characteristics together?

554
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,550
Taking Miss Zhang's reactions into consideration,

555
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,150
I think we'll be able to see if we can find anything new.

556
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,140
You can do it on your own, and I can do it on my own.

557
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,470
Why do we have to do it together?

558
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,310
Qingfeng.

559
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,790
Here. Mr. Zhang.

560
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,510
Put it here.

561
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,550
Come on.

562
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,790
Architect Li.

563
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,230
All the drafts are here.

564
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,270
Each architect has different habits,

565
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,470
so they all use different kinds of paper.

566
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,190
The drafts in these two reels

567
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,270
are quite special.

568
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,150
You can have a look.

569
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,830
The others are basically similar.

570
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,630
There are a lot of

571
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,270
really exquisite drafts here.

572
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,550
Mr. Zhang,

573
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,220
you must have spent a lot of money

574
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,350
renovating this house, right?

575
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,630
Money is never a problem.

576
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,110
Now, as long as you can build a house

577
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,150
that can help Fu sleep well,

578
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,550
my father and I will be happy.

579
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,150
Boss Luo is right.

580
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,590
There are many creative

581
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,950
and excellent designs.

582
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,870
But they are just not the most beautiful house according Miss Zhang.

583
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,830
So I want to know what exactly

584
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,750
is the most beautiful house to her.

585
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,830
I'm curious about that.

586
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,230
So I will do my best to finish this job.

587
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,510
I have no idea.

588
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,070
I have another question.

589
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,630
Go ahead.

590
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,470
What was the cause of your sister's hysteria?

591
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,710
If you dare to go out of this house,

592
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,510
don't ever come back.

593
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,630
Father, please calm down.

594
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,630
Don’t get too angry.

595
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,830
Fu, you too.

596
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,030
Listen to father.

597
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,830
Let him go back.

598
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,590
Are you going to let him stand outside the house?

599
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,740
Father, can't you just meet him?

600
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,230
The Zhang family now has

601
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,030
quite some reputation in Lin'an.

602
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,110
Many high-ranked officials are lining up to marry you.

603
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,830
Many young talents are lining up to be our matrilocal son-in-law.

604
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,230
What does Xu Qian have?

605
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,150
Xu Qian has his own business.

606
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,990
Business?

607
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,550
You call selling fruits and sweetmeats on the street business?

608
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,750
I like him for who he is.

609
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,070
Besides,

610
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,190
weren't you also a poor guy when you were young?

611
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,350
Fu, you are silly.

612
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,670
Does a man like Xu Qian deserve you?

613
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,900
Does he deserve our Zhang family?

614
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,590
Father, I always do everything you tell me to.

615
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,350
Can't you just let me do it my way once?

616
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,870
Have I not let you do it your way?

617
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,550
I asked you to learn music, chess, calligraphy and painting,

618
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,150
but you always followed your brother to go for shooting and hunting.

619
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,390
What kind of a girl would do that?

620
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,030
But at last I did

621
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,510
listen to you and practice music every day,

622
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,270
didn't I?

623
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,310
That's what you're supposed to do.

624
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,550
I'm your father.

625
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,110
You are my daughter.

626
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,110
As long as you're in the Zhang family, you shall listen to me.

627
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,670
So

628
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,230
it was Councillor Zhang who didn't allow your sister

629
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,110
to be in a relationship with Xu Qian?

630
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,710
Not just my father. I also said no.

631
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,860
Couples from families of equal status make the best marriage.

632
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,670
Xu Qian is not qualified

633
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,150
to marry my sister.

634
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,310
Families of equal status...

635
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,070
I wonder how many lovers

636
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,420
were forced to break up because of that.

637
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,110
Mr. Zhang, Miss Han didn't mean that.

638
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,270
What happened later? Please go ahead.

639
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,780
Then Xu Qian elpoed with Fu.

640
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,630
My father was furious.

641
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,110
So he sent me to go after them.

642
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,950
Xu Qian, stop!

643
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,950
Fu, stop the carriage.

644
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,070
We need to talk.

645
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,470
Fu! Don’t stop!

646
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,260
Hurry up!

647
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,710
Xu Qian!

648
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,030
Stop the carriage.

649
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,350
Where are you taking Fu?

650
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,910
You won’t be able to escape here.

651
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,590
Xiao Fu won't marry you.

652
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,430
Come on.

653
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,350
Fu!

654
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,910
Their carriage turned over.

655
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,510
Xu Qian died on the spot.

656
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,790
Fu was unconscious.

657
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,260
When she woke up, she got hysteria.

658
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,230
She is fine during the day.

659
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,670
It's just that it seems

660
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,910
she doesn't remember Xu Qian anymore.

661
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,030
But at night,

662
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,470
she goes crazy and talks nonsense.

663
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,150
She doesn't listen to anyone of us

664
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,350
and asks for the most beautiful house in the world.

665
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,630
Although Xu Qian died,

666
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,870
I still hate him.

667
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,350
Without him,

668
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,750
Fu wouldn’t have become like this.

669
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,110
Is it really that important to have families of equal status?

670
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,790
You may not understand, Miss Chen.

671
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,510
My father spent his whole life

672
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,390
trying to make himself from poor to rich.

673
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,710
But in the end,

674
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,670
he is still a businessman

675
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,550
who's a second class citizen.

676
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,510
So he always hopes that Fu and I

677
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,870
can change the status of our family.

678
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,950
Only in this way,

679
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,150
Fu and I, along with our children,

680
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,030
will hold our heads up high

681
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,150
and be respected.

682
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,390
My father has worked so hard

683
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,460
and hope he can find a son-in-low who's an official.

684
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,670
At worst,

685
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,230
that guy should be from a family of businessmen.

686
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,350
What's wrong with that?

687
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,150
No.

688
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,310
We understand what you are trying to say.

689
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,990
Why don't we...

690
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,310
Why can't businessmen hold their heads up high?

691
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,910
As long as they can support themselves

692
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,070
and their families,

693
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,990
and have their own dreams and principles,

694
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,070
while maintaining the basic ethics and code of conduct,

695
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,430
they can hold their heads up high.

696
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,510
That's right.

697
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,110
There are businessmen who do good and give back to society.

698
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,020
And there are high-ranked officials who do evil.

699
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,110
It's not about what you do for a living,

700
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,030
but about what you are by nature.

701
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,870
You two are so unsophisticated

702
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,790
and naive.

703
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,830
You have no idea

704
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,990
how cruel the reality is.

705
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,870
If you are a businessman, no matter how successful you are,

706
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,150
no one will really look up to you.

707
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,990
Even among friends,

708
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,950
you're still the most inferior one.

709
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,710
My father just wants to change the status of the family.

710
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,790
There's nothing wrong with it.

711
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,150
Those who are hungry want to have food.

712
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,830
Those who have food want to wear pretty clothes.

713
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,750
Those who have pretty clothes

714
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,630
want more money.

715
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,790
Those who have money,

716
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,510
like your father, want to change their status

717
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,630
and become an official.

718
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,230
After being an official,

719
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,830
they'll want to go higher and higher.

720
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,350
That's not wrong.

721
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,630
That is human nature.

722
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,550
But the pursuit of desires is never-ending.

723
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,510
On the way to pursue desires,

724
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,670
if you hurt your loved ones,

725
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,030
you must stop and think about

726
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,140
what is more important,

727
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,470
your desires

728
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,070
or your loved ones?

729
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,670
Mr. Zhang,

730
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,710
don't get me wrong.

731
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,940
We didn't mean to dismiss you.

732
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,550
We just want you to

733
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,870
put yourself in your sister's shoes

734
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,470
and really think about it,

735
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,150
so that you can

736
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,950
understand your sister better.

737
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,230
It will also be helpful for her condition.

738
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,590
You are right.

739
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,870
Let me go back and talk to my father.

740
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,470
After all, my sister's illness is our priority.

741
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,870
Architect Li,

742
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,870
anything other questions?

743
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,030
Since I have known the whole story,

744
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,510
I’ll try my best

745
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,950
to see if I can build the most beautiful house

746
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,190
for your sister.

747
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,550
That's great.

748
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,790
Thank you, Architect Li.

749
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,190
Mr. Zhang, let me see you off.

750
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,350
Miss Zhao.

751
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,680
[Wood Feather House]

752
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,950
This is?

753
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,670
This is the employer of our next project.

754
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,190
Mr. Zhang.

755
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,900
This is Miss Zhao Yining.

756
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,190
She is the owner of Wood Feather House.

757
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,100
Zhao Yining?

758
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,710
Are you the daughter of Mr. Zhao Xian?

759
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,030
Are you doing business with my father?

760
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,190
Not yet.

761
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,070
But

762
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,070
your father and my father do know each other.

763
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,870
Mr. Luo and I

764
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,630
are going to talk about the project budget.

765
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,790
Since you’re the boss, shall we have a discussion together?

766
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,940
I never get involved when Mr. Luo talks business.

767
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,750
You go ahead.

768
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,270
Miss Zhao, since we are all businessmen,

769
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,950
could you please do me a favor?

770
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,910
Let's talk

771
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,830
and make friends.

772
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,470
OK.

773
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,750
Thank you.

774
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,390
Please.

775
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,190
Miss Zhao, please.

776
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,740
We're not that close, so excuse me for not drinking with you.

777
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,110
Mr. Zhang,

778
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,790
Miss Zhao is always very straightforward.

779
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,510
That's why she is so different

780
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,390
from the others.

781
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,510
Here, I'll have a drink with you.

782
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,750
Mr. Zhang,

783
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,060
have you saw the budget?

784
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,630
I've checked the final amount.

785
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,590
No problem.

786
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,390
Mr. Zhang, you're straightforward too.

787
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,390
You're just like Miss Zhao.

788
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,550
Miss Zhao,

789
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,230
I wonder if you will go to my house too

790
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,990
when your colleagues go to work there?

791
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,030
I’ll go if Li Qingfeng goes.

792
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,510
What do you mean?

793
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,990
Because I like him.

794
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,910
With all due respect,

795
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,230
Mr. Luo, please forgive me.

796
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,350
Isn't it inappropriate for Architect Li

797
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,110
to be with Miss Zhao?

798
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,950
Your families don't really match, right?

799
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,750
I don't care.

800
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,620
You have something to say to me, don't you?

801
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,750
No, no.

802
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,350
Good.

803
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,220
Come on. Let's drink.

804
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,750
We'll take the work

805
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,950
to renovate Miss Zhang's room.

806
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,710
Luo. Miss Han.

807
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,390
Go and find some information about Xu Qian.

808
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,350
See if you can find anything useful.

809
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,990
Do it as thorough as you can.

810
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,590
OK. Just leave it to us.

811
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,510
Sir?

812
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,310
Go ahead.

813
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,870
You won't let me

814
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,310
do the hard work again, right?

815
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,150
Go find a doctor

816
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,870
who knows about hysteria

817
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,030
and check on Miss Zhang.

818
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,910
Luo,

819
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,110
go with him.

820
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,750
You're more considerate.

821
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,900
Remember, ask the doctor

822
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,750
to see if you can learn more about the illness.

823
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,070
Okay.

824
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,510
It's quite easy, but it's a bit too easy.

825
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,510
Councillor Zhang once said that

826
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,140
he has gone to every famous doctor in Lin'an to no avail.

827
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,670
So if you want to find another doctor,

828
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,910
you must find someone who knows hysteria

829
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,830
and is good at treating hysteria. That's not easy.

830
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,270
How is it not easy?

831
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,150
I’ll just go and find...

832
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,750
Sir!

833
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,990
Why don’t we

834
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,870
go now?

835
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,150
Miss Han, let’s go, too.

836
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,830
Qingfeng, we're off.

837
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,510
What about me?

838
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,630
I don't have things for you to do now. Just stay here.

839
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,710
What are you looking at?

840
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,310
If you don't want to work with me,

841
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,909
I can do it myself.

842
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,739
You...

843
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,790
OK, then do it yourself.

844
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,190
Miss Zhao, I'm going to work.

845
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,389
I see. Focus on your work.

846
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,550
I won't disturb you.

847
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,750
Didn't you say you didn't want to work with me?

848
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,540
I did say that.

849
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,390
But I don't think you want to leave.

850
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,950
Right?

851
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,350
Or you can ask Miss Zhao

852
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,580
to build another Wooden Feather Pavilion for you.

853
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,950
She wouldn't say no.

854
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,310
You don't need to

855
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,190
get Miss Zhao involved.

856
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,190
You just don't want me to say bad things about her, right?

857
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,710
I would never do that. She's not the bad one.

858
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,190
Would you want me to say bad things about Mr. He?

859
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,270
I don't care. Just say it if you want.

860
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,230
If you don't know what to say,

861
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,950
I can kindly help look up more words for you.

862
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,590
Come on.

863
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,270
What a waste of time. Boring.

864
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,270
I wonder if Dr. Lin is in his mansion now.

865
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,550
If not,

866
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,830
do we have to go to the palace to invite him?

867
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,030
By the way, Luo,

868
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,820
did you bring your badge?

869
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,670
Yes.

870
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,350
I also thought of this before I left,

871
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,750
so I went back to take it.

872
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,540
I'm never obsessed with details,

873
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,270
while you're smart and thoughtful.

874
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,380
You and I are a perfect match, huh?

875
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,670
Sir,

876
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,030
don’t say that.

877
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,350
What's wrong?

878
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,870
You like my lady,

879
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,390
so you shouldn't say that

880
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,870
to another girl,

881
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,990
in case people misunderstand us.

882
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,790
But you're not just another girl.

883
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,220
You’re my Luo.

884
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,350
By the way, I have another favor to ask.

885
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,380
What is it?

886
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,870
When we pass by my family house later,

887
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,870
go home with me.

888
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,150
Go home?

889
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,390
Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.

890
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,990
I'm afraid I can't go back after we start work.

891
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,830
Since we have some free time today,

892
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,780
you can go back with me to meet my mother.

893
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,540
But it's your mother's birthday.

894
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,390
I don't think I should go.

895
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,870
If you don't go,

896
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,150
my mother will interrogate me for three days

897
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,630
to find out where you are.

898
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,390
Please, just do me a favor.

899
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,390
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

900
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,150
Let's go.

901
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,270
Watch the steps.

902
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,880
[Qian Fu Sugar Store]

903
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,390
There you go.

904
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,870
Three coins. Thanks.

905
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,990
Goodbye.

906
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,380
Boss.

907
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,030
Could you tell me

908
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,910
how much the sweetmeats are?

909
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,070
Three coins for one catty.

910
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,230
More expensive than before?

911
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,630
Sir,

912
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,190
our price has always been the same.

913
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,390
That's not true.

914
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,630
When Mr. Xu was here,

915
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,870
these only cost two coins.

916
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,510
Mr. Xu?

917
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,860
Him?

918
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,910
We're different.

919
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,380
It's always three coins when I run this store.

920
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,870
But if you two buy in bulk,

921
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,790
I can make it...

922
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,390
5 coins for two catties for you.

923
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,260
Very good.

924
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,430
I asked around.

925
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,710
They haven't seen Mr. Xu for a long time.

926
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,630
I'm afraid that

927
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,260
you may never see Mr. Xu again.

928
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,870
Has he left Lin'an?

929
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,910
Not just Lin'an.

930
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,710
He has left the mortal world and gone to heaven.

931
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,140
How could this have happened?

932
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,390
If I hadn't rented this store,

933
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,710
I wouldn't have known about this

934
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,750
It's the landlord who told me.

935
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,860
It's a secret.

936
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,230
Sounds interesting.

937
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,710
Please tell us what happened.

938
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,150
Didn't I just tell you

939
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,310
it's a secret?

940
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,350
I'll have 20 catties.

941
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,590
Here, here.

942
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,990
Mr. Xu

943
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,270
eloped with Councillor Zhang's daughter and died from falling off the carriage.

944
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,670
Sir, please take back your chin.

945
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,430
Don't let it fall and break my floor.

946
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,310
I know this is shocking.

947
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,670
When I heard about that,

948
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,390
I didn't believe it either.

949
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,070
I wonder what is so good about Xu Qian

950
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,830
that he could get Miss Zhang to fall in love with him.

951
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,660
That makes two of us.

952
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,670
I was wondering that

953
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,870
if it were me,

954
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,670
even if she would like me,

955
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,870
I wouldn't have eloped with her.

956
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,390
Even if I have to kneel in front of the Zhang's mansion for three years,

957
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,230
I would make sure that I could really marry her.

958
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,310
But that's just my wishful thinking.

959
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,540
The Zhang family

960
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,550
is way out of my league.

961
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,350
If you insist on climbing the higher tree,

962
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,510
when you fall, you can only blame yourself.

963
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,750
Very wise, boss.

964
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,030
You're brilliant.

965
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,150
Just out of curiosity,

966
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,550
do you know anything else about Xu Qian?

967
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,470
No.

968
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,550
No?

969
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,390
Goodbye.

970
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,540
Wait!

971
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,030
What about the fruits?

972
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,790
You're not buying them?

973
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,230
The story you just told me

974
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,940
is not worth 20 catties.

975
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,870
What else do you want to know?

976
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,990
How old was Xu Qian? Where did he live?

977
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,950
How tall was he?

978
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,310
You know none of those.

979
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,470
I want to know so much.

980
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,500
But you can't answer my questions.

981
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,750
I have no choice but leave.

982
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,030
No matter how delicious your fruits are,

983
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,990
I don't like them.

984
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,230
Please. Please don't leave.

985
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,910
I do know something else.

986
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,910
I don’t know where Xu Qian is from.

987
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,310
But

988
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,750
he is about the same age as us.

989
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,510
He's quite tall.

990
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,870
He lived...

991
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,230
I don't know where he lived.

992
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,230
But I know he rented a place to live.

993
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,710
Its owner

994
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,230
is the landlord of my store.

995
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,500
I heard that

996
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,230
that's where he

997
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,190
rendezvoused with Miss Zhang.

998
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,270
Rendezvous?

999
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,350
Yes.
