No.

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,300
Miss,

566
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,620
don't cry.

567
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,790
You can tell me what's wrong here.

568
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,990
Sis, you don't know.

569
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,270
Every time a man gets the embroidered ball,

570
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,590
he has to be tested by Lord Zhao.

571
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,590
And the last test

572
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,030
will be carried out in this room.

573
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,390
This room?

574
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,910
You are Miss Zhao?

575
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm not Miss Zhao,

576
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,550
But I have to pretend to be her.

577
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,580
I see.

578
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,470
The last test

579
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,270
is the seduction of the beauty.

580
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,670
You pretend to be Miss Zhao waiting here.

581
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,310
If the person who got the embroidered ball is seduced,

582
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,670
then he fails the test.

583
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,630
If he is a gentleman,

584
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,190
then he can see the real Miss Zhao.

585
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,270
Yes.

586
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,470
But the girls who did this before told me that

587
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,550
every man who entered this room

588
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,670
was a hypocrite.

589
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,950
No gentlemen at all?

590
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,270
Maybe he won't go too far in this room.

591
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,910
Lord Zhao asked us...

592
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,140
asked us to...

593
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,780
to lure the man on purpose.

594
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,390
That's wicked!

595
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,110
It's not like that.

596
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,150
I'm indebted to Lord Zhao and Miss.

597
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,260
They treat me very well normally.

598
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,710
Itâ€™s just that it sounds very horrible as described by the girls.

599
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,350
That's why I...

600
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,510
I...

601
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,470
Alright. Forget it.

602
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,270
A maiden like you

603
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,140
definitely treats chastity as life.

604
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,340
If he's a philanderer, you must feel miserable

605
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,390
even if you're only touched by him.

606
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,910
Let me help you.

607
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,710
How about this?

608
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,830
I'll do this test for you, okay?

609
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,950
I can't put you in danger!

610
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,470
No, we can't do that.

611
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,270
Don't worry.

612
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,910
If it's Senior Li Qingfeng here,

613
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,390
then everything's gonna be much easier.

614
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,590
But if it's a philanderer...

615
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,190
Don't think I can't see through you.

616
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,790
I know what you want.

617
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,620
Let me tell you the truth.

618
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,830
It's Ning's idea to select her husband in this way.

619
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,910
I've never been willing to accept it.

620
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,470
So today,

621
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,390
you have to give up

622
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,940
marrying my daughter here,

623
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,070
then this box of gold will be yours.

624
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,710
If you still have any other ulterior plots,

625
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,750
I think I've made it very clear.

626
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,630
It's up to you.

627
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,070
I'd like to give up.

628
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,990
You don't hesitate at all!

629
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,270
You just give up like this?

630
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,950
I won't take this box of gold either.

631
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,390
I just want to meet Miss Zhao.

632
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,910
You...

633
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,030
Mr. Li, do you not understand what I mean?

634
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,150
Or you just pretend you don't understand?

635
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,700
Mr. Li, if you're willing to give up,

636
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,870
why do you insist on meeting Ning?

637
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,990
I come here today

638
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,470
for business cooperation with Miss Zhao.

639
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,670
Unexpectedly, I got the embroidered ball.

640
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,910
Being in a panic, I came to explain myself.

641
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,190
Now I shall return the ball.

642
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,630
If I've offended you,

643
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,710
please forgive me.

644
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,510
You...

645
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,750
You...

646
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,670
What?

647
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,270
Stop, stop!

648
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,990
The Inspection Ministry comes to arrest Zhao Xian.

649
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,950
Anyone who resists shall be killed!

650
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,110
No! No!

651
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,590
Your knife, your knife, your knife...

652
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,750
Put down the knife.

653
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,870
Your Excellency,

654
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,430
you made a mistake.

655
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,910
Didn't you just say...

656
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,550
It's my fault.

657
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,390
I made a wrong judgment.

658
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,230
So, Your Excellency,

659
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,070
sorry for bothering you today.

660
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,950
I shall treat you tomorrow

661
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,470
at the Drunken Immortal Restaurant

662
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,310
to express my gratitude.

663
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,550
He's coming out.

664
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,940
He comes out so soon.

665
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,790
Well... Mr. Li really passed the test?

666
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,030
I knew it.

667
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,270
This kind of test

668
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,230
is just a piece of cake for my brother.

669
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,990
Even if he passes these two tests,

670
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,030
there is another ultimate test waiting for him.

671
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,390
The outcome is still up in the air.

672
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,030
It's you?

673
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,230
Why don't you help me?

674
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,790
Why are you staring at me?

675
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,230
Mr. Li.

676
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,030
You... what the hell is with you?

677
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,230
My Lady, are you all right?

678
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,270
Itâ€™s okay.

679
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,550
You...

680
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,190
Mr. Zhou, I'm here

681
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,870
just to see Miss Zhao.

682
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,190
It's really unnecessary for you

683
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,590
to keep testing me.

684
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,190
Okay.

685
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,590
Then come with me to see Lord Zhao.

686
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,550
Are you okay?

687
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,910
I'm fine.

688
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,150
Don't worry. They didn't recognize me.

689
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,070
Why hasn't he come out?

690
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,180
My lady, why do you come out from here?

691
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,350
I certainly should come out through the front door.

692
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:06,910
Let's go.

693
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,950
Where are we going?

694
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,870
Wood Feather House.

695
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,660
By the way, did you see Senior Li Qingfeng?

696
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,910
Let's talk on the way.

697
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,510
Let me tell you.

698
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,630
I just rescued a girl.

699
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,630
My Lord.

700
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,310
Stop it.

701
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,630
You may leave.

702
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,630
Yes.

703
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,270
Mr. Li.

704
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,750
You mean you came to talk business with my daughter?

705
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,270
But why did you enter my mansion in this way?

706
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,510
You even happened to get the embroidered ball!

707
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,310
It's a long story.

708
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,470
I did get the embroidered ball by accident.

709
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,830
But you have got the ball.

710
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,630
In that case,

711
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,150
you're still not interested?

712
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,110
Not at all.

713
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,630
Okay.

714
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,830
What business do you want to talk with Ning?

715
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,220
My friend and I co-established a team of craftsmen.

716
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,950
Because of the poor management,

717
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,510
we are short of money now.

718
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,510
So we'd like Miss Zhao's to invest in our team.

719
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,820
You need money?

720
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,710
Yes.

721
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,510
I just asked you to take this box of gold and leave.

722
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,590
Why did you refuse it?

723
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,990
These are two different things.

724
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,380
Don't beat around the bush.

725
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,590
Lord Zhao, the gold

726
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,670
belongs to you.

727
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,990
But I just told you that

728
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,190
if you gave up the embroidered ball,

729
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,190
this box of gold would be yours.

730
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,350
You also told me

731
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,790
you didn't want to marry my daughter.

732
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,390
You could have left with this box of gold.

733
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,350
But why do you insist on seeing my daughter?

734
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,630
Could it be that the gold

735
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,110
is not enough for you?

736
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,870
I also made it very clear.

737
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,270
I don't want to marry your daughter.

738
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,870
My friend and I just want to see Miss Zhao

739
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,350
to discuss the investment.

740
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,390
Please let me see Miss Zhao.

741
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,670
Leave!

742
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,980
If you donâ€™t, my brother won't spare you.

743
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,950
Get out of here!

744
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,510
Leave!

745
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,590
Get out of here!

746
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,110
Get out of here!

747
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,710
Wait.

748
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,390
Ning, why are you out?

749
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,430
Mr. Li wants to see me.

750
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,790
And I also want to take a look at Mr. Li.

751
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,750
Greetings, Miss Zhao.

752
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,350
Please forgive me if I offend you.

753
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,630
Mr. Li, am I pretty?

754
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,030
Yes.

755
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,990
Ning.

756
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,350
Father.

757
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,950
I want to ask Mr. Li a few more questions.

758
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,390
You are a carpenter?

759
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,670
To be more precise,

760
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
I'm an architect.

761
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,510
You own a team of craftsmen?

762
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,750
My friends and I co-founded it.

763
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,510
I'm in charge of constructing,

764
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,110
and get 40 percent of the profits.

765
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,310
Since you have met me,

766
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,350
I want to know if I give you another chance,

767
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,949
will you still return the embroidered ball?

768
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,710
Yes.

769
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,219
You don't even think about it?

770
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,429
You dislike me that much?

771
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,389
Miss Zhao, don't get me wrong.

772
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,989
We don't even know each other.

773
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,550
How could I dislike you?

774
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,270
I just think

775
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,230
marriage should be based on love.

776
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,750
Only with love can two become each other's lover,

777
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,510
and make a good marriage out of their own will.

778
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,940
That's my humble opinion, and I'll practice what I believe.

779
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,989
That's also why I return the embroidered ball.

780
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,460
Please forgive me.

781
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,100
Even when 300 taels of gold is put in front of you,

782
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,190
you're still going to refuse?

783
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,429
Li Qingfeng.

784
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,989
You are the one!

785
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,510
You're the one I want to marry.

786
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,139
You...

787
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,150
Nonsense!

788
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,310
Miss Zhao,

789
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,190
I think I've made it clear just now.

790
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,909
I know.

791
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,350
But I don't care.

792
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,989
I want to marry you.

793
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,790
I won't marry you.

794
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,350
Am I not good enough for you?

795
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,470
It has nothing to do with it.

796
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,550
If you don't marry me, then you won't get my investment.

797
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,510
I shall leave now.

798
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,550
Li Qingfeng.

799
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,630
Stop!

800
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,380
[Happy Ever After]

801
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,550
How is it going?

802
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,110
It doesn't work. Let's go.

803
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,110
Li Qingfeng.

804
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,390
You're so attractive

805
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,710
and beautiful!

806
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,180
You must be Miss Zhao.

807
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,550
Iâ€™m Luo...

808
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,380
None of your business.

809
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,990
Miss Zhao, what else do you want?

810
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,790
Miss Zhao...

811
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,870
I like you.

812
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,430
It's our first meeting. How could you?

813
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,830
I don't care.

814
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,190
Anyway, I have a crush on you.

815
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,540
I just hope you can give me time.

816
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,830
I will show you what kind of a person I am

817
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,630
and give you a chance to fall in love with me.

818
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,790
What do you think?

819
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,990
Since we are friends now,

820
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,950
Miss Zhao, could you please offer us some investment?

821
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,390
Of course!

822
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,190
Senior Li Qingfeng.

823
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,030
Senior Li Qingfeng.

824
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,260
Oh my god.

825
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:27,950
Come on.

826
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,550
Hello?

827
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,990
Hello?

828
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,990
He hasn't come back yet.

829
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,460
Let's wait a little longer.

830
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,150
Your Grace!

831
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,470
I told you to call me lady.

832
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,790
My Lady.

833
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,140
No matter how well the house is built,

834
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,190
it's built by an architect.

835
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,710
You are a noble lady.

836
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,950
It's already degrading for you to come all the way looking for him.

837
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,550
Now you still have to wait for him here!

838
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,630
It's just inappropriate.

839
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,510
Let me tell you.

840
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,670
This time I come out of the palace

841
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,750
for joining a team of craftsmen.

842
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,550
So,

843
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,270
it's appropriate for me to wait here.

844
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,390
Do you really come out of the palace

845
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,390
for this?

846
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,470
Luo, you know it.

847
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,430
I love architecture.

848
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,710
My biggest dream

849
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,980
is to design constructions myself.

850
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,910
To start with the drawing,

851
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,820
and then to build houses step by step.

852
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,030
Then people can live in houses that I build.

853
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,030
If I don't leave the palace,

854
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,430
all these can only be empty talk.

855
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,860
Besides,

856
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,190
I don't know why His Majesty

857
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,910
always tell me to have music, chess, calligraphy and painting classes.

858
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,990
Auntie Zhao, Auntie Li...

859
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,870
Oh my god.

860
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,270
I was so busy but miserable every day.

861
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,910
Do you want

862
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,430
to see me cry every day?

863
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,550
No.

864
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,950
I know you're the kindest one.

865
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,670
Now that...

866
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,470
we're free,

867
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,950
let's go for a walk?

868
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,270
Yes!

869
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,710
Let's go!

870
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,990
Look.

877
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,190
It's just a workshop.

878
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,190
You're going to join them anyway.

879
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,990
It doesn't hurt to see it in advance.

881
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,550
Look at the bustling capital.

882
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,830
I'm still ambitious!

883
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,110
I...

884
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,950
Let's pay the craftsmen's money back later

885
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,630
and make some plans.

886
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,780
During this period,

887
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,990
I've really suffered a lot!

888
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,420
You can do it yourself.

889
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,350
I shall go back alone later.

890
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,830
First, everyone hates me,

891
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,990
so as long as you return the money, they won't care whether I'm there or not.

893
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,350
I just remembered that

894
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,950
I didn't lock the door when I left.

895
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,070
We have nothing to lose in the Wood Feather House anyway.

896
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,590
Wood Feather Pavilion was not locked either.

897
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,150
You have to go back now.

898
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,790
Your treasures are all there.

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,270

909
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,550
it can fly!

But Senior Qingfeng is not here.

913
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,550
But I've never seen a wooden bird fly.

914
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,020
Try it.

915
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,430
We'll only fly it in this room.

916
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,390
There won't be any problem.
