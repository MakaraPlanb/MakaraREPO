and yet he's so close to me.

00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,060
Could it be that he likes me?

He's your scandalous brother-in-law,

It's now off-work hours.

Mm.

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,220
Can I borrow the electricity

-for breakfast,  -Thank you.

52

I saw Xiaoran

53
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,060
walking out from Mr. Lai's room.

54
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,420
Why do you think they booked two separate rooms

55
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,700
if they were going to sleep together?

56
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
What do you know?

57
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,660
Rich people are capricious like that.

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,020
Xiaoran and Mr. Lai shared a room?

59
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,100
Yeah.

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, Xiaoran.

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,020
You shared a room with Mr. Lai last night?

66
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,980
There was a blackout.

67
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,340
So I just made do for the night.

68
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,420

Good, good. That's a relief.

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,220
Mr. Lai is really good at taking care of people.

79
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,659

81
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,180

84
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,340
The rest will be handled by Director Wang.

85
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,820
That means the filming will begin soon, right?

86

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,340
When will Xiao Han join the crew?

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,140
I want to hang out with her.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,740
Why would Xiao Han be joining the crew?

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,380
She won't be?

91
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,860
Then I must be mistaken.

92
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
I'll be taking my leave first.

93
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,020
There are only three candidates.

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,740
If it's not Xiao Han,

95
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,020
it has to be Tang Na.

96
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,540
No.

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,170
Isn't there another girl from the idol group?

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,460
That young lady recently

99
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,380
accepted a role in a variety show.

100
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,500
Lemeng must have rejected her.

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,740
Why else would she be in a variety show?

102
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,420
Help me contact Tian Daren.

104
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,820

Still awake?

106
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,500

107

'entertainment industry discipline inspection Commission'.

109
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,900
You write these

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,740
groundless accusations

111
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,130
and distorted news everyday.

112
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,780
Aren't you afraid of receiving a lawyer's letter?

113
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,420
I have to write even if I am afraid!

114
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,020
I am determined

115
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,300
to turn my 'entertainment industry discipline inspection Commission'

116
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,340
into the country's most popular account!

117
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,740
And then you'll earn advertisement money?

118
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,660
It's not gracious anymore if money is involved.

119
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,660
My goal isn't to earn money,

120
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,460
but to use its enormous influence

121
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,570
to help me find someone.

122
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,460
Find someone?

123
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Who?

124
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,980
This matter,

125
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,580
I don't usually tell anyone.

126
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,980
But considering our relation,

127
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,860
I can tell you about it.

128
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,980
When I was young,

129
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,740
my mother was a regular volunteer at the orphanage.

130
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,810
She would bring me along to play.

131
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,980
The orphanage had a fruit tree.

132
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,460
The fruits were really sweet.

133
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,100
But I was too short

134
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,180
and couldn't reach them.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,500
Then there was this boy,

136
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,540
who used his toy sword

137
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,220
to knock the fruits down for me.

138
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,620
Later on, that boy

139
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,050
even confessed to me.

140
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,620
But unfortunately,

141
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,220
before I could accept his confession,

142
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,980
he was adopted.

143
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,220
He even confessed to you?

144
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,900
Mm!

145
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,260
Now that I think about it, he was my first love.

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,610
Silly, right?

147
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,820
But I believe,

148
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,580
we will surely

149
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,940
meet each other again in the future.

150
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,940
When we do,

151

he has no wife,

152
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,700
and I have no husband,

153
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,580

It's late. I'm sleeping.

155

What's that about?

156
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,100
Is he angry?

157
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,180
Is it because he saw me gossiping,

158
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,260
and got upset?

159
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,010
No matter what happened in the past,

160
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,900
the one who caught you now

161
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:37,890
is me.

[Lemeng Pictures]

163
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,340
This is way too shocking.

164
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,060
Looks like their career is over.

165
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,900
Quick, I'll save a copy for you.

Who would have thought?

Look at this one.

170
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,540
What gossip is this? So popular.

171
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,340
To think there are gossips I don't know about.

172
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,020
Oh no.

173

This is bad.

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,420
As for Global Picture, I will have a word with them.

193
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,140
I will let you know when we have arrived at a conclusion.

194
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,780
Mr. Lai.

195
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,940
Why are you here?

196
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,300
Why didn't you get more sleep?

197
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,490
How could I possibly sleep

198
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,380
when something like this is happening?

199
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,900
Don't panic.

200
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,980
There will be a way.

201
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,730
Mr. Lai.

202
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,820
The main cast is worried that Tang Na's matter

203
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,100
will negatively affect <The Journey of the Youth>.

204
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
So they want us to consider changing the actress.

205
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,100
Is this matter even true?

206
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,180
What if there's more to it than that?

207
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,460
We are unable to contact Tang Na.

208
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,420
Her agent is also not answering our calls.

209
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,340
Must have been spammed by the press.

210
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,500
No matter the means,

211
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,420
make sure you get a hold of her.

212
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,460
Have someone check on her house.

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,900
Understood.

214
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,660
I'll go!

215
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,260
You'll go?

216
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,260
Their house is currently surrounded by reporters.

217
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,170
There are too many people.

218
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,780
No problem.

219
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,220
I have an idea.

220
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,780
Tang Na!

221
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,340
Tang Na is here!

222
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,700
Hurry! Hurry up!

223
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,420
After her!

224
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,130
Tang Na!

225
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,540
After her, after her!

226
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,460
Tang Na! Stop running!

227
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,940
Tang Na is over there!

228
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
All the best, Ding Dong!

229
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,700
All the best!

230
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Xiaoran.

231
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,700
I had no idea this was going to happen.

232
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,580
So the matter

233
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,700
was true?

234
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,810
When we first started dating,

235
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,020
he told me he was single.

236
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,100
Later, I found out he had a family,

237
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
and I immediately broke up with him.

238
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,900
Besides,

239
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,740
that was two years ago.

240
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,940
Yes.

241
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,780
Back then, someone did catch us on camera.

242
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,580
But the matter was already suppressed.

243
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,380
Why did it suddenly get...

244
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,700
I've always kept a low profile,

245
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,340
and never had a grudge with anyone.

246
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,700
This time, I must have

247
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
gotten in someone's way.

248
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,060
Do you think

249
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,780
that my career is ruined?

250
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,420
Don't say that.

251
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,700
You are a victim too.

252
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,940
You just need to step out,

253
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,060
explain things to everyone,

254
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,380
and let them know the truth.

255
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,580
Then, as soon as this blows over,

256
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
everything will be fine again.

257
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,700
Besides, don't they all say that

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,100
the internet has no memory?

259
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,380
The entertainment industry doesn't need the truth.

260
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,100
Isn't such matter

261
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,010
what everyone likes to see the most?

262
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,500
This matter

263
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
has a sizable impact on <The Journey of the Youth>.

264
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,460
You must be here to talk about terminating our contract.

265
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,890
No, no.

266
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,620
We haven't even decided on termination yet.

267
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,940
Besides,

268
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,180
there may still be a way to turn the tide.

269
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Xiaoran.

270
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,660
They say you're cold and heartless,

271
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,140
and only care about profit.

272
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,300
But I realize,

273
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,340
you are different from what they say.

274
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
Thank you for visiting today.

275
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,780
Don't be too upset either.

276
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,140
Mm.

277
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,340
Why aren't you eating?

278
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,460
A scandal from two years ago

279
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,300
only coming to light now.

280
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,060
Someone must be behind this.

281
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,500
Currently, the most enviable factor

282
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,540
is <The Journey of the Youth>.

283
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,060
But her role was not officially announced.

284
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,340
Few people know about it.

285
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,260
Few people know about it.

286
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,220
That means

287
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,500
filming will begin soon, right?

288
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,140
When will Xiao Han join the crew?

289
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,100
I want to hang out with her.

290
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Xiao Han.

291
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,260
Why would she join the crew?

292
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,540
She won't be?

293
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,740
Then I must be mistaken.

294
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,540
It's me again. I'm the idiot

295
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,740
who let it slip.

296
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,980
Only Ren Qingyan was present that time.

297
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,690
Ren Qingyan is a suspect.

298
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,420
But there is no evidence so far,

299
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,500
it cannot explain anything.

300
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,180
It is most likely her.

301
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,620
My sister was right.

302
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,140
I am the reincarnation of a pig spirit,

303
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,290
and I am astonishingly stupid.

304
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,930
At first I even bragged that

305
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,980
I would be a good Bi Xiaoran.

306
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,940
In the end?

307
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
I am nothing.

308
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,740
I couldn't even do such a small task,

309
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,450
and yet I talk about shouldering my sister's burdens.

310
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,460
I'm such an idiot.

311
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
You're not an idiot,

312
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,210
you're just too naive.

313
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,660
Cheating is common in this circle.

314
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,860
It's impossible to guard against all of them.

315
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,580
There are tons of people who would do anything

316
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,780
for the sake of getting a role.

317
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,370
Fortunately, <The Journey of the Youth>

318
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,180
has not started filming.

319
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,940
There is room for maneuver.

320
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,700
Then.

321
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,900
Will Tang Na

322
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,540
really be swapped out?

323
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,150
Mm.

324
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,660
I apologize,

325
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,620
for my private affairs had

326
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,420
occupied everyone's public resources.

327
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,100
My ignorance in my youth

328
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,740
resulted in this problem,

329
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,020
and I sincerely apologize to everyone.

330
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,260
Following this,

331
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,300
I think,

332
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,740
I will leave the entertainment industry.

333
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,730
I plan to study abroad,

334
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,220
and polish myself for the better.

335
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,660
I am sorry, everyone.

336
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,500
Xiao He.

337
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,220
Turn it off.

338
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,460
Tang Na's matter has now concluded.

339
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
The heroine of <The Journey of the Youth>

340
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,700
needs a new candidate.

341
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,940
Everyone,

342
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,860
what do you think?

343
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,460
Let- let-

344
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,020
Let- let-

345
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,660
Let Qingyan do it.

346
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,460
One- one of our own.

347
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,730
Reliable.

348
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,500
Mr. Ren.

349
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,940
Is she busy?

350
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,620
There is a movie seeking to cast her lately,

351
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,740
but she has yet to accept it.

352
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,460
De- de-

353
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Decline it!

354
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,220
C-c-come

355
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,540
Fill- fill-

356
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,660
fill the vacancy.

357
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,460
That's right.

358
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,260
One of our own.

359
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,490
That's right!

360
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,460
Everyone,

361
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,140
I think Xiao Han is a good choice too.

362
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,500
Miss Bi, do you not look at the actor's schedule?

363
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,940
After we rejected her,

364
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,140
Xiao Han went straight to another crew.

365
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,300
They have already started filming.

366
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,700
What about Zhou Bing?

367
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,100
She has been on a roll lately,

368
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,300
and she wants to act.

369
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Are you crazy?

370
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,860
Zhou Bing's level of acting

371
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,460
is no match for

372
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,020
our heroine of <The Journey of the Youth>.

373
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,180
That's right.

374
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,140
Right?

375
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,740
Right.

376
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,980
Time is tight and the task is heavy.

377
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,460
Let's go with Qingyan.

378
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,300
Mr. Lai.

379
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,460
What do you think?

380
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,550
Director Wang.

381
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,930
In terms of only the character,

382
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,300
do you think Qingyan fits the role?

383
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,380
Qingyan

384
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,820
is not a bad choice.

385
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,380
But compared to Tang Na,

386
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,540
her acting is a little lacking.

387
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,420
However, she has a good aptitude.

388
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,940
With some guidance,

389
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,020
she can produce good results.

390
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,780
But most importantly,

391
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,380
what is her schedule like?

392
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,940
Alright.

393
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,050
We will appoint her for the role.

394
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,980
Mr. Lai...

395
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,660
<The Journey of the Youth>

396
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,020
will begin filming in a week as per normal.

397
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,220
Please make sure

398
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,500
to start work and proceed carefully.

399
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,260
There must not

400
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,780
be any more mistakes.

401
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,930
Dismissed.

402
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,580
Come on,

403
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
we will go home-

404
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,140
Together.

405
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,020
Let me help you.

406
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,740
No need.

407
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,460
Are you angry?

408
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,609
Because of Ren Qingyan?

409
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:16,859
Stand still.

410
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,900
Speak your mind,

411
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,660
I don't like cold wars.

412
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,859
You knew she had something to do

413
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,220
with what happened to Tang Na.

414
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,530
Why did you still help her

415
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,740
get what she wanted?

416
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,780
Filming starts in a week,

417
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,220
and she is our best option right now.

418
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,020
Even so, we shouldn't cast

419
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,620
a problematic actress.

420
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,180
Her problem

421
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
has nothing to do with <The Journey of the Youth>.

422
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,300
As long as there are benefits, it's fine.

423
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,540
Many things in this world

424
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,820
do not have absolute rights or wrongs.

425
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,020
Winner takes all and losers have no rights.

426
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,500
It all comes down to your own capabilities.

427
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,820
In the end, I am to blame.

428
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,580
I blame my stupid mouth.

429
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,340
If I had not let slip,

430
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,980
Tang Na would not have been switched out.

431
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,940
Everyone makes mistakes.

432
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,580
There were traps everywhere,

433
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,140
it was inevitable that you fell into one.

434
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,780
You're already doing your best,

435
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,980
stop blaming yourself.

436
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,420
What?

437
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,020
Are you crying?

438
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,460
Are you joking?

439
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,980
Who would cry over this?

440
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,740
Then what is this?

441
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,980
Spit, spit.

The remuneration for the heroine's role

449

in <The Journey of the Youth> has been finalized.

450
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,140
We must sign the contract with Ren Qingyan

451
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,100
within our allocated budget.

452
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,420
So many people out there

453
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
would volunteer themselves for free

454
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,540

[Actor employment Contract]

456
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
What could she possibly use to bargain with us?

457
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,860
Before we appointed her,

458
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,020
everything was negotiable.

459
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,740
But now, she happens to be

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,900
our best option.

461
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,220
Of course she would seize the opportunity

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,860
We have reviewed Lemeng's contract.

486
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,060
It is very unreasonable.

487
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,730
Nowadays, even a small actor

488
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,770
is worth more than this,

489
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,980
let alone our Qingyan.

490
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,490
The proposed salary

491
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,780
is the result of

492
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,460
Lemeng's careful considerations.

493
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,020
It is very in line with market standards.

494
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,900
Besides, such a splendid project

495
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,980
is a rare opportunity.

496
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,260

You've been in this line of business for many years.

You should know the rates

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,860
of this market better than any of us.

501
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,770
Forget about actors with published work

502
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,250
and fame to their name,

503
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,700
even a remotely impressionable

504
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,180

505
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,780
would charge a couple million dollars

to star in some random

507
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,020
movie or web drama.

508
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,650
Actors like Qingyan,

509
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,220
who have status, influence,

510
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,860
and high popularity,

511
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,380
are definitely worth more than what you proposed.

What do you think, Xiaoran?

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,980
But,

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,060
we have a limited budget for this project.

515
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,230
If we raise the remuneration for the actors,

516
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,140
we will be forced to cut on

517
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,300
other production costs.

518
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,540
The quality of the entire project

519
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,460
will be reduced.

520
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,060
No need to exaggerate.

521
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,300
My amount of salary

522
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,900
cannot possibly affect the entire project.

523
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,380
I have already reduced my own worth.

If not for Zhengyi,

And if we really are one family,

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,500
why is there a need to mention money?

533
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,500
I really want to work with Director Wang.

534
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,660

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,460

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,180
How much is she asking for?

546
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,940
One and a half million per episode!

547
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,100
Is she crazy?

548
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,940

549
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,010
I can't afford it even if I sell my kidney.

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,820
to accommodate her.

552
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,340
Ren Qingyan is a tough case.

553
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,300
Why don't I get someone else to do it?

554
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,100
No need.

555
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,900
I'll do it.

556
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't you hate her?

557
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,420
Why are you

558
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,260
making it difficult for yourself?

559
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,220
I am to blame too

560
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,420
for Tang Na's matter

561
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,420
If not for my dumb mouth,

562
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,500
we wouldn't even need to

563
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,740
get on Ren Qingyan's good side now.

564
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,660
So I want to make up for my mistake.

565
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,980
Rest assured,

566
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,300
I may not be as capable as my sister,

567
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,700
but I will do my best!

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,770
Maintain.

572
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,610
Good.

573
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,380
Strike another pose.

574
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,740
Very good.

575
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,340
Splendid.

576
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,580
Alright,

577
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
Makeup artist, touch up please.

578
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,620
We are moving to the next set.

579
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,410
Good job.

580
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,170
Bi Xiaoran is here.

581
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,600
Xiaoran,

582
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,330
what brought you here in person?

583
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,640
You see,

584
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,970
<The Journey of the Youth>

585
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,400
will begin filming soon.

586
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,080
The male lead Su Ziyi

587
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,210
and the other two actors

588
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,250
are already in the crew.

589
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,000
So...

590
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,370
Xiaoran,

591
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,800
I am in the middle of work.

592
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,210
Oh.

593
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,800
Work is priority.

594
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,890
Focus on that first,

595
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,650
we can discuss things after you're done.

596
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,290
That reminds me,

597
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,530
I want to wear my

598
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,480
Haute Couture dress tomorrow.

599
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,450
Help me collect it.

600
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,010
Alright.

601
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,360
Xiaoran.

602
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,170
I will get back to work.

603
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,550
Xiaoran,

604
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,480
can you

605
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,120
help me bring my high heels along?

606
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,930
It's inconvenient for me to pick them up,

607
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,440
and it's tiring to walk there in them.

608
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,850
Xiaoran, are you

609
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,050
unwilling to help?

610
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,480
I.

611
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
It's no problem,

612
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,810
no problem at all.

613
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,770
I am above humiliations,

614
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,970
I can endure hardships,

615
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,290
I am tolerant and resilient!

616
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,810
Let's go.

617
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,090
Here.

618
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,090
Leave it there.

619
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,930
Xiaoran,

620
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,050
you're here to visit,

621
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,000
but you're empty-handed?

622
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,920
I.

623
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,850
I forgot.

624
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,280
You must all be thirsty and hungry.

625
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,000
I will go fetch some drinks and snacks.

626
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,090
I am fine with anything.

627
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,810
But it has been a tiring day of work

628
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,610
for everyone here.

629
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,770
There is a rather nice cafe

630
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,050
west of town.

631
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,170
Their afternoon tea

632
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,210
is pretty good.

633
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,170
Of course.

634
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,840
I get what you mean.

635
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,280
-Hello -Hello, Miss.

636
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,890
How long will it take

637
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,690
for fifty sets of afternoon tea set?

638
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,290
At least an hour.

639
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,970
What?

640
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,720
That's too long.

641
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
Could you rush the order?

642
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,570
Hurry up?

643
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,490
Alright, alright.

644
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,080
We will do our best.

645
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
I'm sorry you had to

646
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,610
carry Ren Qingyan's shoes for her

647
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,450
this afternoon.

648
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,440
It's fine.

649
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,650
Tolerance is a virtue.

650
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,360
As long as she signs the contract,

651
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,840
I could even call her my grandfather.

652
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,410
But...

653
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,490
Can I claim this expense?

654
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,730
Yes.

655
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
Two more cups please!

656
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,050
-Extra large size! -Sure.

657
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,600
This kind.

658
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,760
Easy does it, easy.

659
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,410
Milk tea is here!

660
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,120
Let's leave it here first.

661
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,490
Put it down first, here.

662
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,080
Alright.

663
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,650
Slowly, slowly.

664
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,010
Where are they?

665
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,850
I don't know.

666
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,890
Try calling them.

667
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,440
Hello?

668
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,890
We've brought the drinks to the set.

669
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,650
Where are you guys?

670
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,540
You're too slow,

671
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,660
we have wrapped up for the day.

672
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,330
I am currently having dinner

673
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,640
with some investors.

674
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,370
Why don't you join us?

675
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,850
We'll start eating when you're here.

676
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,200
Hello?

677
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,250
What's going on?

678
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,330
They are done for the day.

679
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,010
She said she left for dinner.

680
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,490
Let's go.

681
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,130
Hurry.

682
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,170
-Let's go. -Come.

683
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,330
Xiaoran,

684
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,410
why are you always late

685
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,610
to everything?

686
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,400
Everyone was hungry

687
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,770
so we started eating first.

688
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,250
We left some for you,

689
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,090
dig in.

690
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,360
No need, no need.

691
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,370
I'm not hungry anyway.

692
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,880
Excuse me, Miss. Ren,

693
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,850
this is your bill.

694
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,130
Pang Ting took my bag with her.

695
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,370
My phone's battery is flat too.

696
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,000
Go on,

697
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,010
keep acting.

698
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,330
Xiaoran,

699
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,690
could you...

700
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,880
I'll get it.

701
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,530
Take it as my treat.

702
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,170
Thank you, Xiaoran.

703
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,490
Well then,

704
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,130
can we discuss the project now?

705
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,170
Sure.

706
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,850
Let's discuss it.

707
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,490
I have reflected everything we

708
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,850
discussed yesterday to Mr. Lai.

709
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,290
Regarding your salary, he had stated that

710
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,010
there is no room for negotiation.

711
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,890
If the salary does not meet my minimum requirement,

712
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,370
I will not agree to the job.

713
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,450
But <The Journey of the Youth>

714
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,450
is Lemeng's S-tier project.

715
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,720
It is a completely different level from

716
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,850
those trashy films in the market.

717
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,880
Those trashy films pay a fortune for actors,

718
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,560
reducing the quality of the production.

719
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
This results in bad reviews from viewers,

720
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,810
and causes an overall loss in the end.

721
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,760
A good production

722
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,640
must put its money to good use.

723
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,080
And a good production

724
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,290
will be beneficial to you too.

725
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,800
I believe, it will become

726
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,610
your most representative work.

727
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,850
Do all top-tier producers

728
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,570
discuss remuneration like this?

729
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,010
You sound like you're bargaining at the groceries.

730
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,520
I.

731
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,130
It's true.

732
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,680
I do need a representative work

733
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,160
that is good and well-received.

734
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,570
<The Journey of the Youth>

735
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,210
is indeed a good script.

736
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,760
But.

737
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,720
Oh,

738
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
Feel free to voice any

739
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,290
questions or requests.

740
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,410
The heroine's character is not likable enough.

741
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,170
Some lines are also quite terrible.

742
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,010
Lines?

743
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,850
Which lines?

744
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,010
For example, the one that goes:

745
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,650
Currently, the many martial arts factions

746
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,970
are eyeing the dragon jade pendents covetously.

747
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Wushen Clan, Shaolin, and Taiyi in particular

748
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,570
are prepared to seize

749
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,600
Ming Jue at any moment to interrogate him for the truth.

750
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,570
And yet, now you're asking me, Leng Yue to hand him over.

751
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,960
Do you treat my

752
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,810
psychic sword formation as mere decorations?

753
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,810
You overestimate yourself.

754
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,650
Oh dear.

755
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,810
Xiaoran.

756
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,730
Are you alright?

757
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,780
-I accidentally got too into the act. -I.

758
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,570
It's ok, it's ok.

759
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,770
I'm fine.

760
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,170
Hello?

761
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,130
Alright.

762
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,130
I'll be there.

763
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,160
Xiaoran,

764
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,530
I still have things to attend to.

765
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,520
I'll take my leave first.

766
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,490
Alright.

767
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,010
I'm done paying.

768
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:45,930
What happened to you?

769
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,210
Why is your face all wet?

770
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,570
Life is too hard on me.

771
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,610
It's fine now.

772
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,250
It sucks.

773
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,850
It's fine.

774
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,330
Don't be too upset,

775
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,130
I'll wipe the water for you.

776
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,130
She made me carry her shoes

777
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,050
in front of all those people.

778
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,010
But I'm a tolerant person,

779
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,050
so I didn't mind.

780
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,570
She told me to buy drinks for everyone,

781
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,770
but it was all for nothing.

782
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,650
That is fine too, I can let it pass.

783
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,010
But she

784
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,650
lured me to the restaurant

785
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,600
to foot the bill for her,

786
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
and poured water all over my face.

787
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,560
That's too much!

788
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,050
Do I not have shame?

789
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,730
Do I not have dignity?

790
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,370
Here.

791
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,520
Your claim.

792
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,050
My shame and dignity

793
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,690
have been restored.

794
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,520
Why are you so greedy?

795
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,770
People die for money,

796
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,730
birds perish for food.

797
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,250
Even Ren Qingyan who is so rich

798
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,490
wouldn't budge an inch

799
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,010
when her remuneration is concerned.

800
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,970
Do you still plan to deal with her

801
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,890
when she is treating you like this?

802
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,810
I have long hated the thought of dealing with her.

803
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,850
Who even wants to talk to her?

804
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,320
I just didn't want to embarrass my sister.

805
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,450
Besides,

806
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,610
I took the job on myself,

807
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,570
and I have to get it done

808
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,520
even if I have to crawl on my knees.

809
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,200
A small setback like this is nothing

810
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,010
to cheerful pretty girls like me.

811
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,400
Ren Qingyan, this tough old bone.

812
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,530
I will do whatever it takes

813
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,290
to chew her down.

814
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,130
My life ends here.

815
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,160
Deep breathing, deep breathing.

816
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,450
Breathe.

Fortune awaits

818
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,130
those who survive great danger.

819
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,090
I return to the living.

820
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,370
Mr. Lai.

821
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,410
Look at this.

[Actor salary rankings]

824
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,160
At first I thought

825
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,290
Ren Qingyan's price was ridiculously high

826
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,570
because she was confident she would get the role.

827
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,240
[Ren Qingyan 48 Million]

828
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,090
But this second-rate small actor

829
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,250
starred in a bad film

830
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,530
and earned seven million dollars?

831
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,770
It's too easy to earn big money

832
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,000
in the entertainment industry.

833
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,770
No wonder Ren Qingyan demanded

834
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,840
such a high price on the get go.

835
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,360
Look at this.

836
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,480
As a producer,

837
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,330
you shouldn't read too much gossip content.

838
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,130
It might not be completely reliable,

839
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,250
but everyone knows about

840
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,730
actors' inflated prices.

841
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,770
These inflated prices

842
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,210
have always been a tumor in the industry.

843
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
Recently, I have been

844
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
discussing this matter with other platforms.

845
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,890
We cannot let the actors raise their prices to their liking.

846
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,770
So you have decided on

847
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,850
this joint statement?

852
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,240

cannot surpass 50 million.

Not only will this statement

860
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,850
address the inflated salary problem,

861
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,970
it will also tackle illegal acts such as

862

tax evasion and dual contracts.

863
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,490

That's so impressive.
