00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,740
I never thought

5
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,020
there would come a day

6
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,940
where I could take you

7
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,620
on a stroll like this.

8
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,820
Cut the rambling.

9
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,100
You are so ruthless.

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,300
In the past we could only meet once a month.

11
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,539
I don't care,

00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,780

Our type of relation does not

15
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,100
require us to meet up often.

16
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,539
We can turn it into

17
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,900
one that can meet up often.

I'll buy you another bottle.

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,020
Hey handsome,

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,620

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,300
My girlfriend is right over there,

24
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,140

25
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,260
Does that mean if she is not here,

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,460
you would do it?

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,420
Hey, don't

28
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,620

Who the hell are you?

Why did you harass my wife?

Who are you?

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,140
With which eye did you see me

39
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,780
harassing her?

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,210
She was the one who clung to me.

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
He did it!

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
Her? Please.

But a lady like you

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,340
shouldn't confront people like them head-on,

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,490
I think her acting is fine,

97

but her image doesn't really fit the role.

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,300
She is more suited to be a...

of a stone-cold beauty.

105
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,500

shouldn't they communicate and talk it out

We are both the intelligent

133
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,340
So I think this scene

134
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
should not be acted in this way.

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,060
-Can I try again? -It's fine, don't worry.

197
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,780
Go on.

198
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,860
You have been lying to me all this time.

199
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,060
I cannot-

200
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,540
Wait!

201
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,130
Xiaoran,

202
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,100
Is there anything else I need to adjust?

203
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,580
You.

204
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,740
You're too thin.

205
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,170
According to the script,

206
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,940
-Su Nianxue is a skilled martial artist. -Xiaoran.

207
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,530
So she should have a fitter form.

208
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,980
Your image

209
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,580
makes it hard for me to relate you to the character.

210
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,060
Xiaoran.

211
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,940
Now you are just deliberately finding faults.

212
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,420
Liu Yue is good enough.

213
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,220
Her acting is good,

214
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,140
and she can make bold performances.

215
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,020
Such a good actress!

216
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,610
Besides, isn't it good

217
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,580
to be thinner?

218
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,179
Being thinner will look good on camera.

219
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,770
Mr. Lai.

220
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,610
What do you think?

221
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,100
I think it's pretty good.

222
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,100
Besides, she is Director Wang's direct apprentice.

223
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,140
After she joins the crew,

224
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,820
she will adjust and fit in in no time.

225
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,940
Thank you.

226
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,580
Then, let me ask her one last question.

227
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,780
Go ahead.

228
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,980
Erm...

229
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,250
There is a supporting female character in the show

230
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,380
who is keen to separate Su Nianxue

231
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,580
from the male lead Ming Jue.

232
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,930
If you are Su Nianxue,

233
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,580
what would you do?

234
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,140
If a relationship

235
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
can be intervened by a third party,

236
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,700
then this relationship is not good in the first place.

237
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,980
No loss ending it.

238
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,340
But I believe,

239
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,260
Ming Jue would never

240
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,980
do the wrong things to Su Nianxue.

241
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,140
Splendid!

242
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,220
You have firmly grasped the feelings

243
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,340
and relations between characters.

244
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,420
You are like Su Nianxue in person.

245
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,780
My choice

246
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,660
is her.

247
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,940
Not bad.

248
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,100
Thank you for your approval, Mr. Lai.

249
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,460
See you later.

250
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,740
Alright.

251
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,140
I will take my leave first.

252
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,460
Okay.

253
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,420
Mr. Lai.

254
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,260
Thanks for your handkerchief.

255
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,820
Thank you

256
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,010
for giving me this opportunity.

257
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,580
No need to thank me,

258
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,500
you earned this opportunity

259
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
with your own hard work.

260
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,860
Why is your handkerchief

261
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,300
with her?

262
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,340
Xiaoran,

263
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,100
don't be mistaken.

264
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,090
Mr. Lai lent it to me

265
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,570
to wipe a stain off my shirt

266
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,860
when we ate together.

267
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,220
I still have a event tomorrow,

268
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,420
I won't bother you two any longer.

269
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,780
Mr. Lai.

270
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,700
Hey, you're here.

271
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,380
Mr. Lai.

272
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,580
Having lunch?

273
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,140
Yes we are.

274
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,940
Mr. Lai, where is your food?

275
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,780
My food is

276
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
not here yet.

277
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
Then we will dig in first.

278
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,220
Yes, let's start eating.

279
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,540
What are you guys eating?

280
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,660
Homemade meals, the usual.

281
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,020
You're just eating vegetables?

282
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,460
There is meat too.

283
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,820
Still not here yet?

284
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,620
Oh you're finally here!

285
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,300
I almost starved to death.

286
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,890
Mr. Lai, you're so lucky.

287
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,180
You get to eat Ding Dong's cooking everyday.

288
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,620
Well, you see.

289
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,780
She insisted on cooking for me.

290
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,260
I couldn't stop her even if I try.

291
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,500
Guess what I saw.

292
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,580
Mr. Lai and Xiaoran quarreled with each other.

293
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,660
Don't be such a gossiper.

294
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,500
Exactly.

295
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,900
You know what they say,

296
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,100
a couple's quarrel never lasts.

297
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,220
they'll make up in a day or two.

298
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,900
Your future is bleak

299
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
if you spend all day thinking about love.

300
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,060
You know why Lai Zhengyi is still

301
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,660
just a CEO after all this time?

302
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,420
Why is that?

303
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,820
It's because he's busy dating.

304
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,980
If he had focused solely on his career,

305
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,850
he would have done much better by now.

306
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,690
Don't believe me?

307
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,060
Don't be so absolute about it.

308
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,300
You will fall in love sooner or later too.

309
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
Impossible.

310
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,820
Women will only affect

311
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,220
the speed at which I draw my sword.

312
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,260
Love will forever

313
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,740
be a stumbling block

314
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,780
on my path to victory.

315
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,660
I will never date or fall in love.

316
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,610
Never.

317
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,970
Have some food first.

318
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm not hungry.

319
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,260
Ouch!

320
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,860
Lili.

321
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,700
The stick gave me a splinter.

322
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,210
You can pluck it out yourself.

323
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,380
Such a trivial matter.

324
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,660
Also,

325
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,100
I am formally informing you

326
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,580
that I am moving out.

327
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,170
I'm leaving.

328
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,060
From now on,

329
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,850
don't contact me anymore.

330
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,220
Lili.

331
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,610
Please don't go.

332
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,380
If you go,

333
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,300
how will I live?

334
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,220
Lai Zhengyi.

335
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,660
We

336
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,740
are over.

337
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,900
Lili.

338
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,100
I love you.

339
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,660
I love you with all my might.

340
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,180
Do I really have no chance anymore?

341
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,140
Lili.

342
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,770
Will you please love me one more time?

343
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,220
Well, if you put it that way,

344
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,220
I shall...

345
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,780
Lili?

346
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,010
Lili!

347
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes?

348
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,620
Do you need a ride?

349
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,500
No need.

350
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,700
Qin Yanfei is fetching me.

351
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,410
Alright.

352
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,770
"Alright?"

353
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,610
Just like that?

354
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,500
Not even an attempt to keep me?

355
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm leaving.

356
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm home!

357
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,180
That was fast.

358
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,180
Aren't you always rushing me for it?

359
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,900
I was so busy moving,

360
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,940
I didn't even eat.

361
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,380
There's food.

362
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,460
Hold it right there.

363
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,380
You came back out of the blue

364
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,290
so I didn't prepare your portion.

365
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,130
How could you!

366
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,500
Forsaking friendship for your relationship.

367
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,460
Are you trying to starve me to death?

368
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,700
Who wants to starve you?

369
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,740
What now!

370
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,380
Here.

371
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,780
Just wait here for a while.

372
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,740
How could your dear brother-in-law

373
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,420
ever bear to starve you to death?

374
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,940
One moment,

375
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,860
I'll make you a feast right now.

376
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,780
Be patient, alright?

377
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,820
A feast.

378
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,450
Come, come.

379
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,700
Your favorite seafood feast has been served!

380
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,820
Enjoy.

381
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,980
Tell me if you need seconds.

382
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,500
Babe!

383
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,260
Are you even human?

384
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,620
You call this a feast?

385
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,170
Have a prawn.

386
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,260

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,340
with her 50 meter long broadsword.

769
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,820
My life is on the line here,

770
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,020
I really should go.

771
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,300
Take care of yourself, okay?

772
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,130
Sleep soon.

773
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,620
Sorry

774
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,340
for making you travel all this way.

775
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,210
You can go home,

776
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,700
I'll be fine alone.

777
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,220
Then I will be on my way.

778
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,930
Mm.

779
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,140
Let me know when you get home.

780
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,260
Be safe.

781
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,940
I'll be fine on my own.

782
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,340
How about

783
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,180
I stay here

784
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,620
for the night?
