Shut up.

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,860
Don't disturb my sleep.

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,140
What a weird guy.

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,420
Who are you calling weird?

8
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,370
You must be crazy.

9
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,460
You're crazy!

10
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,500
You lunatic.

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,660
You and your terminal mouth cancer.

Do you feel so proud of yourself

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,340
to know that they're on your side?

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,100
I have come to realize

29
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,900
that I don't belong to this family.

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,300
I'm adopted.

31
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,860
I'm not their biological son.

32
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,090
The three of you are one family.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,460
You can live together.

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,780
Hands off!

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,660
Are you receiving it?

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Damn right,

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,820
I punched you.

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,860
What are you gonna do?

39
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,060
You're starting a fight with me, huh?

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,620
I've wanted to punch you for a long time.

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
I didn't expect it.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,340
You look so polite and gentle,

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,100
but you're quite good

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
at fighting.

45
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,780
You can treat me however you like,

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
but you shouldn't take it out on our parents.

47
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,420
Also,

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,490
about that thing you mentioned earlier.

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,940
It is completely

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,740
not what you thought it was.

51
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,860

53

in the primary school department.

54
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,540
Is he your younger brother?

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,460
No!

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,500
I have no younger brother.

57
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,860
No way!

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,770
You have the same surname.

59
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,660
That's a coincidence.

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
I don't even know him.

61

You made me misunderstand you for so long!

I didn't think it was anything important.

Since you like it so much,

77

don't readily sell it off again.

78
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,990

Isn't my driving pretty skilled?

89
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,260
Why do you want to be an auto racer?

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,980
Do you really want to know?

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,220
Mm.

92
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,780
Do you still remember?

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,060
We went kart racing once

94
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,420
when we were still young.

95
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,620
Ever since we were kids,

96
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,500
you would beat me at everything.

97
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,820
You were the best at everything you did.

98
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,900
But one time,

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,860
I won you in kart racing.

100
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,080
From then on, I swore

101
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,930
to become an auto racer no matter what.

102
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,930
Because that is the only thing

103
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,250
I could beat you in.

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,650
It's true.

105
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,730
You did beat me that day.

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,890
But it was because you lost

107
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,450
to me so many times that day,

108
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,810
you refused to leave the amusement park.

109
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,320
So Mum and Dad asked me to go easy on you.

110

It's fine,

112
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,200
it's fine.

113
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,170
I just changed to the wrong gear.

114
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,680
Your driving skills are really something...

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,250
What happened to

116
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,170

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960

I'm sorry.

123
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,170
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

Even if you apologize,

125
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,490
we're not allowing you to race.

126
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,290

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,440
I think auto racing

But, at his current level,

140
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,090

Didn't you sell it?

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,170
you can ask him yourself.

195
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,720
[Lemeng Pictures]

196
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,330
Since he's already openly showed goodwill,

197
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,370
I don't have to put on a front anymore.

198
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,210
Xiaoran.

199
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,120
Mr. Lai.

200
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,850
Why is your shoe so dirty?

201
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,690
How can you enter my brother's company like this?

203
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,450
I'm so sorry.

204
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,770
There was a construction downstairs.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,690
I must have accidentally stepped into a mud puddle.

206
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,840
I don't care what hole you fell into.

207
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
But now, you need to

208
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,690
wash your shoe,

209
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,440
mop the floor clean,

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,090
and then come in.

211
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,490
Understood?

212
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,120
Understood.

213
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,570
Did his personality split?

214
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,320
I have no idea.

215
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,200
Go ahead and do your thing.

216
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,680
Don't leave any more mud.

217
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,570
Be careful.

218
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,410
Put on a front?

219
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,040
You were right.

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,810
I was viewing my brother through

221
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,810
colored glasses in the past.

222
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,410
So he always looked

223
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,040
despicable in my eyes.

224
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,210
But things are different now.

225
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,560
Now, I view him through

226
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
a pair of high definition glasses,

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,210
and I see nothing but good in him.

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
He may be ruthless on the surface,

229
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,610
but he actually cares so much about me.

230
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,250
Let me tell you

231
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,150
-Good. -what he told me yesterday.

232
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,840
I am glad you two managed to clear the air.

233
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,130
Are you alright?

234
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,480
Why are you sweating so much?

235
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,370
I'm fine.

236
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,450
I'm good.

237
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,600
Do you need to go to the hospital?

238
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm really fine.

239
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,720
I just need to sit down.

240
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,650
But you're sweating a lot!

241
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,330
Okay...

242
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,040
Sit down first.

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,130
Sit there.

244
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,760
Alright, come on,

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,690
you have to go to the hospital.

246
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,570
It's fine, it's fine.

247
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,250
How about

248
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,770
I call the ambulance for you?

249
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,370
No! No.

250
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,170
There's no need.

251
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,760
What's wrong with you?

252
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,040
You're sweating so much.

253
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,330
My Aunt Flo is here.

254
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,130
What?

255
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,570
Your relative is here?

256
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,930
Where is she?

257
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,880
Let's have dinner together later.

258
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,010
Oh gosh,

259
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,930
No!

260
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,970
Here!

261
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,160
Well, is there

262
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,130
anything I could help you with?

263
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,970
Come closer.

264
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,050
Yes.

265
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,130
Go get me a bag of sanitary pads.

266
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,560
I... A man like me,

267
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,320
buys sanitary pads for you.

268
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,930
Isn't that unsuitable?

269
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,040
It's fine.

270
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,850
I have a black plastic bag.

271
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,170
Black plastic bag?

272
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,290
Is he crazy?

273
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,160
Who is this guy?

274
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,050
What a weird guy.

275
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,890
Sir, your sanitary pads.

276
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,290
Do you need a plastic bag for that?

277
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,770
Let's go.

278
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,840
Mr. Lai.

279
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,240
Mr. Lai.

280
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,690
You're all here.

281
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,360
Mr. Lai.

282
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,640
Hello.

283
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,480
-Hello. -Hello.

284
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,720
Where did you get this head mask?

285
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,930
Does it look good?

286
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
Of course!

287
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,210
-It must look good. -Good.

288
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,730
What did you buy?

289
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,010
You went to buy something?

290
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,610
No, no.

291
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,090
I didn't go anywhere.

292
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,850
-Why would I buy anything myself? -Oh, you didn't go.

293
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,890
Back to your work.

294
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,210
-Go on. -Let's go.

295
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,240
That is not how you use

296
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,770
the black plastic bag.

297
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,490
What?

298
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,770
Then, how was I

299
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,970
supposed to use it?

300
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,490
Ah Qin.

301
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,330
Set the table.

302
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,040
More dishes are coming.

303
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Got it, dad.

304
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,130
Hello.

305
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,530
Hello.

306
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,690
Is this Bi Xiaoran?

307
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,400
Do you know Mr. Xu?

308
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,810
Mr. Xu?

309
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,250
Do you mean Xu Yuanhang?

310
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,130
Yes, that is right.

311
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,810
It is Xu Yuanhang, Mr. Xu.

312
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,810
He got drunk in our shop

313
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,290
and kept yelling your name.

314
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,880
Could you by any chance

315
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,250
come and pick him up?

316
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh,

317
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,530
you want me to pick him up?

318
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,810
Where is he?

319
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,490
Shall I send our shop's address to your phone?

320
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,760
Uh...

321
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,850
She's not free. She's showering.

322
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,370
What are you doing?

323
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,890
How can you fetch anyone

324
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,770
when your legs are like this?

325
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,690
Besides, he has a girlfriend.

326
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,490
You don't have to worry about him.

327
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,160
I didn't say I was going to fetch him.

328
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,970
I just asked where he is.

329
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,570
Slowly now.

330
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,250
Thank you.

331
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,810
Slowly, slowly.

332
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,040
Sit, sit and rest.

333
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,170
Thank you.

334
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,200
-Thanks. -How are you feeling now?

335
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,090
It must hurt a lot.

336
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,170
Much better now.

337
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:45,970
Thank you.

338
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,760
Don't mention it.

339
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,370
I checked the internet,

340
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,210
and it says that

341
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,520
women should drink brown sugar water

342
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,600
when they are menstruating.

343
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,290
Is that your kitchen?

344
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,440
I'll find some brown sugar water for you.

345
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,610
-Don't bother. -It's fine, don't worry.

346
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,160
You just sit and rest.

347
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,730
There is really no need.

348
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,530
Sit down, I'll find the sugar.

349
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,930
Can you handle it?

350
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,280
The ladle.

351
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,400
Don't put your ladle out like that.

352
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,930
You...

353
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,080
That was the pot.

354
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,250
It fell off the table.

355
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,210
Everything's fine.

356
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,760
It's fine.

357
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,210
I...

358
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,400
I don't really have to drink it.

359
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,970
Be careful.

360
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,730
Don't worry.

361
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,160
Ding Dong.

362
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:16,970
Here.

363
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,250
Look.

364
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,200
Thank you.

365
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,970
Try it.

366
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,610
Thank you.

367
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,530
Come on, drink it.

368
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,400
Is it sweet?

369
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,810
You can try some.

370
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,650
But I...

371
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm not the one menstruating.

372
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,490
I don't need to try.

373
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,170
No need.

374
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,010
Go on, keep drinking.

375
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,090
Take the spoon.

376
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,530
Use the spoon.

377
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,720
What happened to your hand?

378
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,690
It's fine.

379
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,610
Let me see.

380
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,410
It's fine,

381
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,290
really!

382
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,050
Let me see.

383
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,010
Gosh, it's fine.

384
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,120
I assure you.

385
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,490
I just got scalded a little.

386
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,410
Why did you get scalded?

387
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,490
How could you be so careless?

388
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,130
Oh it's fine, I'm a big man.

389
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,920
This is nothing.

390
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,250
I'll blow on it for you.

391

I do need help with something, actually.

You see,

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,690
I have a friend

404
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,770
who kissed a girl and...

405
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,170
You've already asked about that.

406
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:20,890
No, no.

407
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,000
It's uh... It's a little different this time.

408
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,730
He took the initiative this time.

409
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,450
He did it on purpose.

410
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,530
He... Yeah.

411
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,410
You did it on purpose?

412
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,360
Mm.

413
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,480
Did Ding Dong say yes

414
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,210
before you kissed her?

415
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,560
I will take responsibility.

416
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,450
You'll take responsibility.

417
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,210
I didn't say this is about me.

418
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,170
You're

419
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,970
giving me the same excuse.

420
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,490
One word.

421
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,450
Do you like her or not?

422
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,970
That's not a single word.

423
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,010
That's a single phrase.

424
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,610

426
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,570
You should go after her then!

427

Confess to her!

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,730
But how?

I don't know how to confess.

430

So there are things you don't know.

Alright, let's start by calling me something nice.

It's all yours!

434
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,370
You have come to the right person.

435
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,770
I've been reading romance novels for decades,

436
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,730
and there is no situation I have never met before.

437
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,770
This is a small task.

438
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,160
Confessing? Easy.

439
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,810
Let us focus on...

440
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,970
your masculine charm.

441
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,010
Oh, yes.

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,600
I want the kind that would

443
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,850
fully showcase my masculine charm.

Masculine charm, yes?

No problem.

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,610
Don't just stand there.

579
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,090
Once is enough.

580
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,450
What?

581
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,610
If you hadn't helped Lai Zhengling set things up,

582
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,530
he wouldn't have possibly gotten the girl.

583
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,130
He was the one who successfully wooed her.

584
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,120
What I did

585
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,290
was just icing on the cake.

586
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,650
You did a very good job.

587
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,930
It's just funny that he wanted to

588
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,410
show off his masculine charm.

589
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,650
And yet, he got so scared.

590
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,930
Am I really that scary?

591
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,570
Not at all!

592
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,050
You're a cute ghost.

593
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,720
I think so too.

594
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,730
Mm.

596
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,050
Oh, that reminds me.

597
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,330
About the two of us dating,

598
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,210
please keep it a secret for now.

599
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,850
Understand?

600
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,800
Understood!

601
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,210
We can't let it affect our work,

602
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,880
right?

603
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,610
Mm.

604
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,290
A splendid man like me

605
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,170
will do my best to support your career.

606
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:50,960
Rest assured.

607
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,010
A secret office romance.

608
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,040
Just the thought of it thrills me.

609
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,050
What's in your mind every day?

610
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,040
You, of course.

611
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,130
Hey, Ding Dong.

612
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,650
Since we are alone now,

613
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,930
I want to...

614
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Sure, leave it to me.

615
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,490
You can't even handle a task

616
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,290
as simple as this, huh?

617
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,130
All you do is loafing around

618
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,970
without any plan to improve yourself.

619
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,890
What use do you have for the company?

620
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,440
What use do you have for our production department?

621
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,210
Mr. Lai.

622
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,530
Don't take it to heart.

623
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:36,960
You know, women.

624
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,130
They all have those days.

625
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,330
Ding Dong doesn't hold grudges.

626
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,410
When she cools off,

627
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,010
this whole thing will be over.

628
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,330
Her expressions change faster than flipping a book.

629
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,760
Why is she so scared of

630
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,530
people knowing our relationship?

631
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,200
I get it.

632
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,050
She must be afraid of people

633
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,490
calling her a social climber.

634
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
After all,

635
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,730
I am the future CEO of Lemeng.

636
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,730
Rest assured, Ding Dong.

637
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,440
I will definitely

638
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,450
take good care of you.

639
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,600
Your small sweetheart is here with coffee...

640
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,770
Your big sweetheart is on a business trip with Ms. Ning.

641
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,370
The two of them again?

642
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,880
He didn't tell me anything about it.

643
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,890
He is off to work.

644
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,760
Should he report that to you?

645
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,950
Alright, I got it.

646
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,410
I guess you can have this cup of latte.

647
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,120
Thank you.

648
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,890
I'm sorry,

649
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,250
I only drink Americano.

650
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,160
Fine, I'll drink them myself.

[Lemeng Pictures]

652
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,930
Humph.

653
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,770
Mr. Lai.

654
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,010
I bought coffee for you today.

655
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,890
But it was such a pity that

656
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,450
you were not there.

657
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,530
I wasted my

658
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,010
one-for-one coffee voucher.

659
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,090
My bad.

660
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,240
I left in a hurry.

661
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,240
From now on, no matter where I go,

662
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,520
I will inform you in advance, alright?

663
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,210
It's fine,

664
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,200
you're a busy man.

665
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,890
I can understand.

666
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,080
Mm.

667
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,210
I'll go back with a gift.

668
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,000
Really?

669
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,170
You're the best.

670
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,010
I'll wait for you.

671
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,800
Come back soon.

672
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,840
Alright.

673
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,530
Zhengyi.

674
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,840
I want to take a look at the mall.

675
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,770
Sure.

676
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,960
Lili, I still have things to do,

677
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,890
I'm ending the call.

678
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,730
Let's go.

679
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,530
Mm.

680
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,530
Why is he with Ning Xia again?

681
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,850
The two of them are always together.

682
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,920
Darn it.
