00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,780
Xiao He is investigating it.

193
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:19,980
But...

194
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,740
This person has gone too far!

195
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,100
If he or she just leaked a few pages,

196
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,660
I could let Qin Yanfei modify a little.

197
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,260
But the whole script was leaked out!

198
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,460
Do we have to rewrite the whole story?

199
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,620
The filming of the Journey of the Youth has already started.

200
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,020
It's impossible to rewrite the story.

201
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,980
Then let's just do it!

202
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,900
Bite the bullet to keep filming it.

203
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Last year, Paradise

204
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,780
didn't win the ratings champion

205
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,460
just because of the leakage.

206
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,770
I'm afraid it's not feasible to shoot over again.

207
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,900
Right!

208
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,530
Then what should we do now?

209
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,760
Contact the major platforms right away.

210
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,440
Ask them to help us

211
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,610
handle this case.

212
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,010
Try our best

213
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,770
to stop the spread of the script.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,890
I got it.

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,650
I got it.

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,270
[Jiangbin Public Security Bureau Documents. About the Leaked Script of the Journey of the Youth.]

217
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,320
With the help of the police,

218
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,450
we've found the account

219
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,770
which firstly posted the script on the Internet.

220
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,890
Its owner is called Sun Cheng,

221
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,490
who works at Mingzhu Maintenance Center.

222
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,250
Now he's detained by the police.

223
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,770
Mingzhu Maintenance Center?

224
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,210
Isn't it the place where I repaired my computer?

225
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,120
According to Sun Cheng himself,

226
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,960
he got the script

227
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,090
right from your computer.

228
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,280
What do you mean?

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,330
Before I gave the computer to him,

230
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,970
I had already deleted all the script!

231
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,000
Did you delete it in the Recycle Bin?

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,170
Sure!

233
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,680
There's no script on my computer!

234
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,850
Really! I...

235
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,370
Mr. Lai,

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,400
I really did delete it.

237
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,210
Please trust me.

238
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,330
Mm.

239
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,690
I trust you.

240
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,650
We'll surely get to the bottom of it.

241
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,210
Mr. Lai, Xiaoran.

242
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,850
The film screw

243
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,050

[Producer Bi Xiaoran]

245
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,040
Mr. Lai,

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
Xiaoran!

247
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,210
You're not a newbie.

248
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,240
How could you make such a rookie mistake?

249
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,130
The script is leaked.

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,650
We've already filmed so many scenes!

251
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,650
And we've worked so hard!

252
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,400
How to deal with it?

253
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,910
It's all because of you,

254
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,280
our hard work

255
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,320
is all in vain.

256
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,160
Wait...

257
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,110
About what happened to the script,

258
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,680
I really have no idea!

259
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,230
Under the circumstances, you're still excusing yourself.

260
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,110
I'm not excusing myself.

261
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,830
I really...

262
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Just because of what he said,

263
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,080
you put all the blame on Bi Xiaoran.

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
Isn't it too hasty?

265
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,910
Mr. Lai,

266
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,190
he already confessed.

267
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,230
How can it be fake?

268
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,200
You can't shield Bi Xiaoran on an official case

269
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
just because she's your girlfriend!

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,520
The police haven't closed the case yet.

271
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,600
So don't rush to hold someone accountable for it.

272
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,920
The first priority now is to solve the problem.

273
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,830
Solve?

274
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,110
How?

275
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,720
We can only rewrite the script now.

276
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,270
I haven't said a word yet,

277
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,550
and do you think I'm dead?

278
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,200
Rewrite the script?

279
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,720
Why don't you work as the scriptwriter?

280
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,310
Then what else can we do?

281
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,910
If you can't do it,

282
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,870
I'd like to recommend a scriptwriter.

Hey, you female star.

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,030
You're talking big.

285
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,710
So are you going to

286
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,550
dismiss me?

287
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,510
Huh?

288
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,680
You're talking nonsense!

289
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,110

290
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,350

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,280

296
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,160
You can keep shooting if you want.

297

But if not,

298
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,070
you may quit right away.

299
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,150
Besides, no one can modify

300
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,920

302
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,830
I do it all for the big picture.

303
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,230
Don't bother.

304
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,910
I have my own ways.

305
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,440
All right.

306
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,910
Let's listen to Mr. Lai.

307
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,790
How did this happen?

308
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,030
I really deleted

309
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,870
the script.

310

311
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,550
Just leave

312
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,760
the other things to me.

313
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,640
No way!

314
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,110
I made this trouble.

315
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,960
I can't let you clear up the mess.

316
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,040
It's okay.

317
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,770
It's my pleasure.

318
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,750
How could Xiaoran

319
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,350
make such a mistake?

320
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,230
It's not like what she would do!

321
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,600
But I trust her no matter what!

322
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,110
About this case,

323
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,160
someone must have framed her.

324
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,910
I agree.

325
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
It's said,

326
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,400
even if the file is deleted,

327
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,720
it can still be recovered

328
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,910
by some means.

329
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,710
Will Xiaoran

330
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,040
be dismissed?

331
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,680
Bah...

332
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,920
Don't jinx it!

333
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,560
All right.

334
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,750
I once thought

335
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,070
Xiaoran had no human tough

336
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,310
before.

337
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,070
But after all these days together,

338
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,830
I find her

339
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,350
nice and friendly.

340
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,990
I'm quite willing

341
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,760
to continue to work

342
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,550
with her.

343
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,680
Right!

344
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,840
Though she's kind of simple-minded now,

345
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,680
but she looks quite cute.

346
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,160
I wonder if she

347
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,710
can get through it this time.

348
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,270
Enough...

349
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,190
Let's get down to work.

350
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,720
Why do things end up like this?

351
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,910
It's totally different from

352
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,190
what you've agreed on!

353
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,510
So long as we can achieve the goal,

354
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,550
the process doesn't matter.

355
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,830
So you did it.

356
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,600
Am I right?

357
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,990
Mr. Lai,

358
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,720
just wait and see.

359
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,880
The good show just began.

360
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,080
Don't ask to meet me again.

361
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,510
I'm annoyed at the sight of you.

362
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,680
I don't think it's a good idea.

363
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,990
I think we should call a meeting

364
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,560
with others tomorrow.

365
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay?

366
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,830
Then I'll call all the shareholders

367
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,720
to the company tomorrow.

368
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,870
Let's have a video meeting.

369
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,910
Okay.

370
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,520
Then, how will you

371
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,710
deal with the media?

372
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,300
Time for the meal!

373
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,070
You eat first.

374
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,660
I'll finish soon.

375
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,280
Mr. Lai?

376
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,480
About the media,

377
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,830
don't disclose the information to them for now.

378
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,550
Okay?

379
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,550
OK. No problem.

380
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,430
Now I've already

381
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,110
had people delete all the relevant posts

382
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,520
and articles on the Internet.

383
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,950
Good.

384
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,440
Don't worry.

385
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,200
I'll surely clean up

386
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
all the difficulties and obstacles for you.

[First Meeting Room]

388
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,840
Now loads of netizens are denouncing

389
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,880
Bi Xiaoran.

390
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
She must have something to do with the leaked script.

391
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,510
And what about her?

392
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,150
She just leaves all the mess to us.

393
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,800
R-right...

394
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
Right!

395
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
Right!

396
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,360
if you want to go home,

397
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
you may leave now.

398
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,560
Mr. Lai,

399
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,470
it's not a big deal this time.

400
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,240
Do you just suspend

401
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
Bi Xiaoran from her job?

402
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,040
Is that so?

403
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,750
Then what's your opinion?

404
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,680
Dismiss her, of course.

405
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,470
Bi Xiaoran have contributed herself

406
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,990
to the company all these years.

407
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,190
I believe everyone has seen it.

408
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,150
Now the truth is not clear yet,

409
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,230
and you just start scheming.

410
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,430
It's unfair.

411
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,790
You show fairness to Bi Xiaoran,

412
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,550
then what about us?

413
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't we, the staff of Lemeng, need fairness?

414
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,880
If you let Bi Xiaoran go like this,

415
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,790
will the company still have authority in the future?

416
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,750
I'm Xiaoran's assistant.

417
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,510
I sent her computer for repair.

418
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,280
But I was so careless,

419
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,630
and had the script leaked.

420
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,470
It's my negligence.

421
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,950
I'll take the blame and resign.

422
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,160
You're just an assistant.

423
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,280
Your resignation will address nothing.

424
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,440
Ding Dong is Bi Xiaoran's right-hand man,

425
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
and an indispensable talent to Lemeng.

426
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,590
Is her departure

427
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,270
still not enough to make

428
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,800

432
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,960
Don't mention it, Mr. Lai.

433
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,480
I did it voluntarily.

434
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,830
It's hard to appease the angry majority.

435
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,870
This is the best arrangement.

436
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,190
Jiang Lili is not very steady

437
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,310
in her work now,

438
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440

439
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,630
not very thoughtful.

However,

441
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,280
she still has a long way to go.

442
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,720
I don't want her to stop here.

443
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,680

446
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,950
Otherwise, she would blame herself.

447
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,030
Okay.

448
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,920

You must be a crazy fan of Bi Xiaoran.

483
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,800
Don't pretend you have nothing to do with her.

484
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Are you Bi Xiaoran?

485
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,200
How rampant you are!

[Don't judge it before you know the full story.]

487
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,230
So there are still sensible people in this world.

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,350
So all the work about

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,710
the Journey of the Youth has been restarted.

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,670
-Director Wang also promises... -Right.

491
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,920
-the schedule won't be delayed. -Keyboard warriors are not worth our time.

492
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,270
But he asks to modify the script.

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,670

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,470
[Right! Keyboard warriors are not worth our time. I'm always on your side.]

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
Do you hear me?

498
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,480
Ah...

499
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,110
Please go ahead.

500
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,550
Director Wang asks to modify the script.

501
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,790
But our script

502
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,040
has already come

503
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,830
to episode 15.

504
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,400
But I'm afraid the character relationships

505
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,670
need to be changed.

506
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
What's your idea?

507
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,830
Change.

508
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,550
[Right! Keyboard warriors are not worth our time. I'm always on your side.]

509
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,790
But I think

510
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,230
aren't there too many scenes

511
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,440
for the heroine?

512
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,470
I'm moved!

513
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,430
I didn't expect there to be

514
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,200
any big fan of Bi Xiaoran

515
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
like you.

516
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,420
[You ID is "A Righteous Passer-by"? You must be a crazy fan of Bi Xiaoran. Don't pretend you have nothing to do with her.]

517
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,400
Still so many criticisms.

518
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,430
Will I ruin my sister?

519
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,630
You spoil everything!

520
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,960
All you can do is making trouble!

521
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,110
Your sister is in a coma in the hospital

522
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,150
because she tried to save you.

523
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,560
But you're making trouble for her everywhere!

524
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,590
Enough! Stop it, please!

525
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,430
Stop!

526
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,830
It's my fault.

527
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,840
-You only bring trouble to the people around you. -No...

528
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,360
-You'll get them into trouble. -No!

529
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,640
Garbage.

530
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Foolish.

531
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,390
It's all your fault.

532
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,350
No!

533
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,630
You ruin Bi Xiaoran!

534
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,350
I didn't ruin my sister!

535
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,620
It's not my fault!

536
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,720
Not my fault...

537
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,140
Not my fault!

538
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,920
Please don't blame me!

539
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,470
Not my fault!

540
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,950
Lili...

541
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
You had a nightmare.

542
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,190
It's my fault.

543
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,000
It's all my fault.

544
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,230
Sorry!

545
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,550
It's all my fault.

546
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,270
I'm so stupid.

547
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,680
Will I ruin

548
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,830
my sister?

549
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,310
It's okay. Calm down.

550
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,580
It's got nothing to do with you.

551
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,390
So many people are criticizing my sister on the Internet.

552
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,630
I'm really furious.

553
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
It's me who made the mistake,

554
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,960
but they curse my sister.

555
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,240
Later, however, I realized,

556
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,920
I am Bi Xiaoran.

557
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,080
I too stupid,

558
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,320
ruining my sister's image.

559
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,310
Do you think it was you

560
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,240
who leaked the script?

561
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,950
Who else did it?

562
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,110
And none of them believed me.

563
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,830
To be honest,

564
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm even doubting myself now.

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,790
Was I so careless

566
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,390
that I didn't delete all the script at that time?

567
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,350
I believe you.

568
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,160
What?

569
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,560
Even I don't believe myself.

570
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,130
Why do you trust me?

571
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,640
I trust whatever you say.

572
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,550
Don't try to comfort me.

573
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm not comforting you.

574
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,390
I just want you to know,

575
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,910
when you hit rock bottom,

576
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,790
and when you feel sad,

577
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,220
there's a man

578
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,070
who trusts you no matter what,

579
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,780
and always stands by your side.

580
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,140
Lai Zhengyi.

581
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,470
Mm.

582
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,220
Thank you.

583
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Don't worry.

584
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Everything will be fine.

585
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,900
Uh huh.

586
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,540
I will never give up on myself!

587
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,500
I'll keep working hard!

588
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
-Xiaoran! -Xiaoran!

589
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,310
I'm here to pay a visit to you guys.

590
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,420
I've brought you milk tea.

591
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,500
Thank you.

592
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,900
Thank you

593
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,020
for your hard work recently.

594
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,220
-Xiaoran. -It's nothing.

595
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,540
We're on your side!

596
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,620
Xiaoran, don't give up!

597
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Without you,

598
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,300
Lemeng is not complete.

599
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,500
Right!

600
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,870
Thank you, guys.

601
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,790
Where's Ding Dong?

602
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,020
What's wrong?

603
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,830
Why are you silent?

604
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,460
Xiaoran...

605
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,350
Why are you here?

606
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
What are you doing?

607
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,380
I've resigned.

608
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,900
Why?

609
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,220
Is it because of me?

610
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,420
Listen...

611
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,230
No...

612
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,140
Even if they must hold someone

613
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,060
accountable for it,

614
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
it's all my responsibility.

615
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,190
It's got nothing to do with you.

616
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,870
You don't have to go.

617
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,740
It's okay for me to leave the company.

618
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,340
But you can't leave.

619
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,420
You're Bi Xiaoran!

620
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,100
Everyone thinks

621
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,060
she's talented,

622
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,540
and got this position easily.

623
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,140
But only I know

624
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,590
how many efforts she's paid.

625
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,700
So I hope

626
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,470
she can keep going along this road.

627
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,740
But you're innocent.

628
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,700
We can think about another solution.

629
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,060
This is already the best solution.

630
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
Ding Dong!

631
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,300
Ding Dong!

632
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,220
I'm the one to leave.

633
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,220
What?

634
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,860
Mr. Lai, why?

635
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,390
What's wrong?

636
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,860
Let me bear the consequences of my own acts.

637
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,610
[Lemeng Pictures]

638
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,470
What did you say just now?

639
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,740
Could you please repeat it?

640
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,780
I said,

641
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,060
what happened to the script

642
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,140
was done by me.

643
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,900
It was really you!

644
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,790
Say it.

645
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,980
What on earth did you do?

646
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,060
Lai Zhengyi is a bastard!

647
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,740
He already has a Plan B.

648
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,750
But he still asked me

649
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,300
to find investment.

650
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,020
But he's already got it!

651
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,460
He just fooled me.

652
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,980
It's hard to understand

653
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,740
what Lai Zhengyi is going to do.

654
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,220
We can only be fooled by him.

655
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,390
Though he looks friendly on the surface,

656
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,860
he's indeed very cunning.

657
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,100
Finally, there's someone getting insight

658
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,380
into the nature of Lai Zhengyi.

659
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
He's been like this since childhood.

660
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,540
I took the blame for the mistakes he made.

661
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,020
It's still the same even after we entered the same company.

662
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
And it's even getting worse.

663
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,590
He seems to see me

664
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,820
as his appendage.

665
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,100
Everyone thinks I can't do great things.

666
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,420
Why?

667
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,460
He bullies you so much.

668
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,380
Do you want to teach him a lesson?

669
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,500
Sure!

670
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,780
But how?

671
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,620
Do you know

672
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,740
that he and Bi Xiaoran are pretending to be a couple.

673
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,860
Pretend to be a couple...

674
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,260
Is it

675
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,020
real?

676
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,300
You also find it strange, huh?

677
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,260
Yep.

678
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,900
We can find out the truth

679
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,220
so long as we investigate it.

680
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,940
If we expose it,

681
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,300
then that Lai Zhengyi's poker face

682
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
will be broken, right?

683
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,860
Well... Wait...

684
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,940
No...

685
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,900
Lai Zhengyi is really tricky.

686
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,980
It's unprecedentedly hard to investigate him.

687
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,670
No way.

688
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,740
If not him,

689
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,030
we can investigate Bi Xiaoran!

690
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,150
If they pretend to be a couple,

691
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,740
then there must be an agreement.

692
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,780
Then where's it?

693
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,480
On Bi Xiaoran's computer.

694
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,710
Later,

695
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,750
I just

696
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,380
broke Bi Xiaoran's computer on purpose.

697
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,620
and let her send it for repair.

698
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,980
And Ren Qingyan

699
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,820
sent a man

700
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,470
to investigate things on her computer.

701
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,660
But I didn't expect

702
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,300
that she didn't look for the contract,

703
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,820
and sent the script to the shop owner.

704
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,460
She also asked the owner

705
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,780
to frame Bi Xiaoran.

706
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,660
So,

707
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,700
it was Ren Qingyan again!

708
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,060
I'm going to finish her this time!

709
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,980
Why do you stop me?

710
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,700
There isn't any hard evidence.

711
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
If you go to meet her like this,

712
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,260
she'll surely deny it.

713
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,860
Then what should we do now?

714
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,900
Chill out.

715
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,940
Let me deal with it.

716
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,660
Zhengyi,

717
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,260
you also come

718
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,420
for the script, right?

719
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,140
It needs to be modified sooner or later.

720
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,260
What's the meaning of shooting now?

721
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,500
If you don't modify it,

722
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,100
my scenes are almost over!

723
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
In order to modify the script and add your scenes,

724
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,980
you've done a lot,

725
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,260
and worked so hard.

726
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,300
Zhengyi,

727
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,510
I don't understand what you said.

728
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,260
Can you stop acting?

729
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,820
Lai Zhengling has told everything to us.

730
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,140
No need to act.

731
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,420
You utilized my younger brother,

732
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,940
and hurt my girl.

733
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,940
How dare you?

734
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,460
Lai Zhengling's personal statement

735
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,820
can't be taken as any evidence.

736
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,790
Do you know

737
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,980
how easy it is to make a person

738
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,100
vanish from the entertainment industry?

739
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,540
Do not try to challenge my bottom line again.

740
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,620
Dad, I'm back.

741
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,980
Qingyan,

742
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,630
can you stop making trouble?

743
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,740
What trouble did I make?

744
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,380
Now everyone in the company

745
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,540
knows you're messing things up.

746
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,710
You really disgrace me a lot.

747
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,060
Why do I

748
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,620
disgrace you again?

749
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,510
Stop talking about things

750
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,420
without evidence!

751
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,430
Evidence?

752
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,860
If it were not during the shooting

753
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,790
of the Journey of the Youth,

754
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,980
and Lai Zhengyi found you still useful,

755
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,740
you would have already been sued,

756
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,470
and you couldn't have been so safe and sound!

757
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,220
You're my dad.

758
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,500
It's okay of you don't help me,

759
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,670
but why are you speaking for others?

760
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,750
Didn't I help you?

761
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,270
In the company, I stood against

762
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,620
Bi Xiaoran just for you!

763
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,780
And this time I even forced Lai Zhengyi to dismiss her.

764
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,700
And then?

765
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,220
It was you who screwed it up!

766
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,300
Qingyan,

767
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,660
behave yourself.

768
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,940
Don't mess up with Bi Xiaoran again.

769
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,420
And don't irritate Lai Zhengyi.

770
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,380
Enough, Dad.

771
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,140
It's my own business.

772
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,860
Stay out of this.

773
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,460
If you go on like this,

774
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,980
one day you'll get into big trouble.

775
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,380
Lai...

776
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,460
Lai Zhengyi.

777
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,900
I'm here.

778
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,630
You're back!

779
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,190
Why do you always sleep on the sofa?

780
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,580
Did I wake you up?

781
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,980
Did Ren Qingyan confess?

782
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,910
Don't worry,

783
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,340
I went to the film crew this afternoon

784
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,260
and handled it.

785
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,620
All of you are protecting me.

786
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,220
Ding Dong took the blame for me,

787
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,020
and you settled affairs everywhere for me.

788
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm the only one

789
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,950
who did nothing.

790
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,140
Just be yourself.

791
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,700
No.

792
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
I'm a loser.

793
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,430
If only being myself,

794
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,430
I'll be done.

795
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,990
I want to make a change.

796
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,500
How?

797
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,140
From today on,

798
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,910
I'm no longer a little coward.

799
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,940
I'm going to be a bomb.

800
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,110
I'll also protect you guys.

801
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,300
Okay.

802
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm looking forward to it.
