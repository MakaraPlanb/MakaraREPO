00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,930

189
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,660
Alright, here you are.

190
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,420
Go home!

191
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,380
She's so grumpy!

192
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
We're not like natural sisters,

193
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,580
except that we look alike.

194
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,900
Unlike me...

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,460
Sister!

196
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,460

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,409

OK, understand.

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,820
There was a situation.

205
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,740
She can't make it now.

206
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,140
I have an important schedule afterwards.

207
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,260
If Miss Bi can't make it today,

208
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,300
then we'll sign the contract some other day.

209
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,580
Hello, Dennis.

210
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,060
I am the Administrative Director of Lemeng Video.

211
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,540
Xiaoran is not here,

212
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,860
but we have Sun Xi.

213
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,260
Sun Xi is also our company's producer.

214
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,100
Greetings.

215
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,700
In terms of seniority,

216
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,460
Bi Xiaoran should call him a senior.

217
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,780
Most importantly,

218
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,900
he won't drop the ball at the crucial moment.

219
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,740
Global Picture is willing to sign the contract with Lemeng Video for two reasons.

220
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,980
On the one hand,

221
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,050
we value the influence of Lemeng Video in China.

222
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,500
On the other hand,

223
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,540
we value Miss Bi's outstanding ability.

224
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
We choose not only the Lemeng Video,

225
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,820
but also Bi Xiaoran.

can only be in her hand,

228
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,420
and we'll be at ease.

229
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,290
You can rest assured of that.

230
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,900
Lemeng will abide by the contract,

231
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,620
giving the project to Bi Xiaoran.

232
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,060
We can sign the contract first,

233
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,170
and move the project forward as soon as possible.

234
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,820
Miss Bi is not available today.

235
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,580
Maybe we should take a rain check.

236
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,180
Finish it today!

237
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,220
Lemeng isn't the only company taking eyes on Global Picture.

238
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,980
Let Sun Xi replace Bi Xiaoran first.

239
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,300

I thought you weren't coming today.

242
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,260
I apologize, it's my bad.

243
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,410
I was held up on my way.

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,100

254
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,220
Mr. Lai, I have something else to do,

255
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,140
I'll leave now.

256
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,340

257
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,700
My sister was hit like this

258
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,980
because of me.

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,020
And before she passed out,

260
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,420
she kept murmuring about the contract.

261
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,610
She put so much effort on this project.

262
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,140
It can't be in vain because of me.

263
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,180
So we came up with this plan,

264
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,380
I pretended to be her and signed the contract.

265
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,260
Under the circumstances,

266
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,620
that was indeed the best way to solve the problem.

267
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,980
Right, don't blame yourself too much.

268
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,850

269
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,660
that Sister Xiaoran is out of danger now.

270
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,300
But...

271
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,340
when will she wake up?

272
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,540
It depends on Xiaoran's own situation.

273
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,580
It might take two days

274
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,020
or even longer.

275
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,820

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,930

277
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,340
The license plate was fully covered.

278
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,020
I didn't see anything.

279
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,460
Besides the hit-and-run driver was also wearing a helmet,

280
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,020
and there was no CCTV on that road.

281
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,740

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,420

283
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,740
to help the officer investigate this case.

284
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay.

285
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,330
We must investigate the case.

289
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,780

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,700
You are the perfect choice.

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,610
No, no.

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,820
I can just played once.

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,780
If this became a long-term strategy,

301
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,540
I will definitely be exposed!

302
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,980
Don't worry about this.

303
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,820
I will help you

304
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,020
about work-related matters.

305
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
Bi Xiaoran worked on The Journey of the Youth

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
for three years.

307
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,580
I don't want her to see

308
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,420
everything she did was all in vain

309
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,660
once she wakes up.

310
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,100
What do you want to ask?

311
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,540
My sister and I have never

312
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,500
been seen in public.

313
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Other than my family,

314
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,540
usually no one knows that

315
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,660
she has a twin sister.

316
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,260
How did you know about this?

317
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
Your sister mentioned about it once.

318
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,740
That's right.

Your sister didn't tell you about this?

327

Never!

328
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,380
Bi Xiaoran was doing a great job

329
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,780
of keeping secrets.

330
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,860

I'm really sorry.

339
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,770
I'm so sorry.

348
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
is under everyone's watch.

349
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,260
You must be aware of this.

350
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,460
I understand.

351
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,420
I need to be mean and more aggressive.

352
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,060
Am I right?

353
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,380
Come over here.

354
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,780

Sun Xue.

359
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,580
They'll spend a lot of time with you in the future.

360
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,260
You need to remember them as soon as possible.

361
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,140
Don't worry.

362
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,260
I'm very good at remembering people's faces.

363
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,340
No mistakes.

364
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,120
Mr. Lai, Sister Xiaoran.

365

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,020
Ren Qingyan?

376
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,730
Alright, I got it.

377
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,900
You go back to work.

378
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,770
Is she the famous Ren Qingyan?

379
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,610
I'm her fan!

380
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,780
Can you let me see her in person?

381
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Just let me take a look at her,

382
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,460
just for one glance!

383
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,780
Jiang Lili.

384
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,780
I won't speak anymore.

385
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,120
Since you want to see her,

386
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,740
then you'll talk to her yourself.

387
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:03,540
I...

388
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,660
What should I talk about?

389
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,740
Ren Qingyan came to our company is for

390
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,069
getting the female lead of The Journey of the Youth.

391
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,540
You should deal with her.

392
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,700
Okay.

393
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,859
I'll go.

394
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,430
It's on me.

395
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,060
I have the character.

396
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,020
They'll start shooting next week.

397
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Why isn't this contract ready yet?

398
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,609
I'll do my best.

399
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,450
How do you guys doing your jobs?

400
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,220
Hello, sister Xiaoran.

401
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,460
What a bad luck.

402
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I ran into a copycat

403
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
early in this morning.

404
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,780
This scene comes once a month.

405
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,060
Last month they dressed the same

406
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,140
and sister Xiaoran forced

407
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
Ren Qingyan to change her clothes.

408
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,700
And the month before that,

409
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
Sister Xiaoran poured a cup of coffee on her

410
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,940
and ruined that cloth.

411
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,180
What will happen this month?

412
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,340
The light of candle cannot be compete with the light of the moon.

413
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,490
This cloth is made exclusively for you.

414
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,180
I don't deserve to wear this.

415
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,380
She can't be crazy, right?

416
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,220
I don't think it's that simple.

417
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,640
I bet she's making a big scene.

418
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm looking for Zhengyi.

419
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,940
Where is he?

420
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,500
Mr. Lai is busy now.

421
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,580
If there's anything, you can ask me.

422
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,930
This project of The Journey of the Youth has been opened.

423
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,060
Every marketing account has listed

424

all the possible actress candidates.

425
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,610
I don't know if our company

426
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,900
has a specific list of candidates.

427
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,010
We haven't made a specific list,

428
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,900
but there was a list indeed, it has...

429
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,260
Speak carefully, Miss Bi.

430

Otherwise, you will have to bear all the consequences.

It's fine.

My father is the shareholder of Lemeng.

437
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,500
Do I seem like an outsider to you?

438
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,820
Mr. Ren is

439
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,100

Speak and act cautiously!

It's fine.

It's your first time to be the producer.

Mistakes are bound to happen.

454

Just don't do it next time.

For signing the contract with Global Picture.

464
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,580
Thank you.

Zhengyi,

470
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,100
we should make the cast of The Journey of the Youth.

471

My daughter Qingyan is currently available.

472
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,390
She can play a role on the project.

473
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,720
That's right.

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
Qingyan is a member of our company,

475
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,110
there is no one better than her.

476
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,030
Now that Qingyan has always been played the female lead in recent shows.

What kind of celebration dinner is this?

to ask for a role.

480
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,040
It's not easy for us to have a dinner together and relax.

481
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,640
It's so frustrating if we talk about works.

482

Come on.

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,440
Jiang Lili.

563
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,990
You have to restrain yourself.

564
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,120
Let me take a look!

565
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,960
Don't... don't touch my book.

566
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,070
Zhengyi.

567
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,400
We've printed the photos.

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,550
Tomorrow we should post these photos online.

569
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,320
Put these photos on the trend for an entire day.

570
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,790
The banquet tonight is a private event.

571
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,190
How did this Li Tianyou

572
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,160
get there?

573
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,680
I heard that he wants to see Bi Xiaoran for a long time.

574
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,400
I did him a favor

575
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,630
out of kindness.

576
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,430
I don't know if I should ask.

577
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,840
What are you

578
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,910
doing all this for?

579
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,870
You've never been in a relationship.

580
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,680
You know nothing about it.

581
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,480
You...

582
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,470
I'll leave now.

583
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,110
Play by yourself.

584
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,320

587
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Hello.

588
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,120
Lili, there was an accident.

589
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Get online quickly!

590
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,190
Wait a moment.

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,480
The woman cheats on the man

593
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,590
and the man comes out of the closet.

[was photographed having dinner at a restaurant with the new generation of actor, Li Tianyou.]

597
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,230
This...

598
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,980
Isn't this the Li Tianyou as yesterday?

599
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,430
Mr. Lai.

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,800
[The woman cheats and the man comes out of the closet]

601
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,880
Lately, the celebrity boss Lai Zhengyi

602
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,230
and his assistant Xiao He have been photographed

603
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,600
kissing in the car by a passerby.

604
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,390
It can't be.

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,670
Morning, good morning.

606
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
I think I'm not late.

607
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,630
The reporters didn't give you a hard time, I supposed?

608
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,440
No, no...

609
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
I came through the back door.

610
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,320
There was no reporters.

611
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,880
How can you be laughing?

612
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,400
At first we made you a couple

613
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,280
is for catching eyes for the company.

614
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Well, let's see.

615
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,350
Now, you two are giving the company a bad name.

616
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,630
Th-the bad

617
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,360
influence is

618
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,110
so strong

619
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,630
that our stocks are dr-dro...

620
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,670
dropping! -The stocks are dropping!

621
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
That's right, they are dropping!

622
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,560
You two represent our company.

623
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,750
Even if each of you have your own private life,

624
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,790
you should take care.

625
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,630
Now you made a scene like this.

626
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,840
It's not good for everyone.

627
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,510
No...

628
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,790
It's not like that.

629
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,000
There was a misunderstanding between Li Tianyou and I.

630
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,710
We can come forward

631
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,840
and clarify ourselves.

632
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,270
Is this your first day in the entertainment industry?

633
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,920
Do you think clarifying yourself is gonna work?

634
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,110
It will only make it worse.

635
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,150
Ex-explain...

636
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Chen, you're being too kind.

637
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
You are my senior.

638
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,510
You don't have to call me sister.

639
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,560
Ex-explaination is a... co-cover up!

640
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,240
And a cover up is the tr-truth!

641
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,870
Do you understand?

642
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,790
I have an idea.

643
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
Let's take down this trend first,

644
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,080
and put some other trends to cover it up.

645
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,990
But by doing so

646
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,310
is equal to acquiescing in such a thing.

647
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,070
How about this?

648
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,030
Let us live together.

649
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,430
What?

650
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,830
Mr. Lai, think carefully.

651
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,070
All we can do now

652
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,680
is to play it by ear.

653
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,070
No.

654
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,950
What do you think?

655
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,280
What a smart move, Mr. Lai.

656
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,070
I hope those negative influences can be eliminated.

657
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
It's not appropriate.

658
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,270
Very nice.

659
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,430
It's a deal.

660
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,710
Can't... can't...

661
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,430
Mr. Chen has something to say.

662
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
You also think it's inappropriate, right?

663
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,720
Let's find another way.

664
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,070
Can't be better.

665
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,400
Do you think so?

666
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,720
Right.

667
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,630
Yes.

668
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,870
Leak the information of us living together.

669
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,390
The more people who know, the better.

670
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,550
So you are doing all of this

671
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,880
to abduct this girl

672
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,800
home with you?

673
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
This is not an abduction.

674
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,990
I was forced to do so.

675
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,670
Huh.

676
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,630
My pen.

677
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,400
In ancient times, Hua Mulan joined the army in place of her father.

678
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,830
Nowadays, the twin sister has to live with someone for her sister.

679
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,360
What kind of world is this?

680
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,310
Think of it as living in a dorm?

681
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,870
A dormitory?

682
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,040
There is no co-ed dormitory.

683
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,910
Sister.

684
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,040
I used think you were God's favorite one,

685
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,390
or Goddess Nuwa's favorite.

686
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,720
You have a large fan base,

687
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,070
getting both fame and fortune.

688
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,590
But now I realized,

689
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,110
it's not an easy task to be Bi Xiaoran.

690
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,520
It's so difficult!

691
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,150
I've only been here for a few days,

692
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,950
now I'm going to

693
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,350
living with someone else.

694
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,120
Sister,

695
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,230
you became like this because of me.

696
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,990
But I don't even have the courage to take the risk for you.

697
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Jiang Lili,

698
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,480
what a coward!

699
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,640
Sister, don't worry.

700
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,830
You've worked so hard to get what you got,

701
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,630
and I will do my best to keep it for you.

702
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,070
It's just living with someone else.

703
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,200
It's not a big deal.

704
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,320
Mr. Lai, I'm coming.

705
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,710
You got this through.

706
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,520
For my sister,

707
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,560
I will do anything.

708
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,880
Smile for me.

709
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,830
Smile?

710
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,630
That's a good angle.

711
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,110
Come on, take a few more photos.

712
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,120
Staged photography, I understand.

713
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,230
Hurry up! Quickly, quickly!

714
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,870
Ah?

715
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,320
This acting is so authentic.

716
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,350
Fine, fine.

717
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,120
Then I'll make a sacrifice.

718
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,590
Wow, big news!

719
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,160
I get it.

720
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,230
I understand.

721
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,750
What are you doing?

722
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,630
I'm talking about you.

723
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,470
Your hair stuck to your face.

724
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,550
Huh?

725
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,710
Jiang Lili.

726
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,390
You are so dirty and stupid.

727
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,270
Suit yourself.

728
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,240
Make yourself at home.

729
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,440
If I have a house

730
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,920
like this someday,

731
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,430
I can wake up laughing.

732
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,990
This could be your house,

733
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,600
if you want.

734
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,110
I don't mind having one more person on my household register.

735
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,230
What? Household register?

736
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,240
I was joking.

737
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,320
Don't be nervous.

738
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,870
From now on, let's get along as friends.

739
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,950
Your room is on the second floor.

740
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,560
My room is on the third floor.

741
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
We don't interfere with each other.

742
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,430
If you really mind,

743
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,520
then I'll try to limit

744
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,670
my public activities in the future.

745
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,470
No, no, no.

746
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't mind.

747
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,230
This is your house.

748
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,710
