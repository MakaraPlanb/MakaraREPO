[Episode 17]

4
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,420
Lili!

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,180
Why are you coughing so much?

6
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,020
I feel so cold.

7
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,220
So hot.

8
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,130
You're having a fever.

9
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,290
Maybe because of my heavy work pressure,

10
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,740
I suffer from low immunity

11
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,380
and have fallen ill.

12
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,740
Let me send you to the hospital.

13
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,900
Don't bother.

14
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,460
Let me just rest at home.

15
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,380
There's no time for me to go to the hospital now.

16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,020
If I still can't handle

17
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,340
that Zhang Xueying tomorrow,

18
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,340
then all the effort will be in vain.

19
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,460
We've paid

20
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,220
so much desperate effort,

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,380
and it's all futile now.

22
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,820
Right.

23
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,220
It's a pity, indeed.

24
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,900
Maybe it's an act of God.

25
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,620
No way!

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,420
My fate can only be decided by me myself!

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,060
This stuff...

28
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,980
is quite warm.

29
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,250
I often feel cold and weak,

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,540
and this is used to warm my body.

31
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,300
Now that you're okay,

32
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,450
I'm gonna leave now.

33
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,420
Mr. Lai!

34
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,460
Please give me three more days!

35
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,060
Mr. Lai!

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Yiyi...

37
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,140
My darling! Please...

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,540
Call me one more time.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,020
Mr. Lai.

40
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,380
Not this.

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,140
Yiyi!

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,620
Not this one, either.

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,540
Forget about it since you're reluctant to call me that.

44
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,579
My darling!

45
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,260
Please!

46
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,400
Then I'll give you three more days.

47
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,480
You're so nice!

48
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,520
My darling...

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
I love you so.

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Guys...

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,050
There's good news for you!

52
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,970
Through my consistent efforts,

53
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,120
I sacrificed myself,

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
and finally convinced Mr. Lai

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,610
to give us three more days.

56
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,570
We must keep working hard

57
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,480
and break through the obstacles.

58
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,200
Why...

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Why do you all look spiritless?

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,450
Did something happened?

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
Something big did happen.

[Zhang Xueying: Fight against the dark. And I finally see the light of hope.]

63
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,220
[Thank you for accompanying me during the battle.]

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,900
What...

65
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,870
[But it's about time to put an end to everything.]

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,810
[I've received apologies from Lemeng, as well as their compensation.]

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,380
What?

68
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,850
[A company which dares to admit its mistakes and shoulder the responsibility is worth forgiving.]

69
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,260
What does she mean by "a company which dares to admit its mistakes

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,459
and shoulder the responsibility"?

71
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,779
What mistakes did we make?

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:18,899
Wait...

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,149
That's complete rubbish!

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,990
Who gave her compensation?

75
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,230
Why didn't I know about it?

76
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,270
No one knew.

77
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,550
After she posted it this morning,

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,910
it seemed to have confirmed Mr. Qin's stigma of plagiarism.

79
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,270
Now on the Internet, everyone says

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,830
our company is afraid of getting into trouble

81
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,070
and has settled this thing with money.

82
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,280
What on earth is this?

83
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,040
We also just saw it.

84
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,490
Good morning.

85
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,600
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,730
Why are you still so happy?

87
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,480
Didn't you check Weibo?

88
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,050
What are you looking at?

89
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,360
Zhang Xueying has made a statement.

90
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,600
Has she?

91
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,920
Then she has kept her word.

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,890
Come on, let me see.

93
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,050
What's this?

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,330
She talked nonsense.

95
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,650
She took my money and still threw mud at us!

96
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll beat her up!

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,330
What do you mean?

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,400
She said it!

99
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,400
She said,

100
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,680
so long as I gave her five million yuan,

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
she'd stop making trouble.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,640
Five million yuan?

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,850
Are you crazy?

104
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,080
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

105
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,910
We were short of time and the task was heavy back then,

106
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,910
so there was no time for discussion.

107
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,950
Do you know

108
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,470
what a great loss you've caused

109
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,110
with your reckless action?

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,230
The efforts made by everyone is now in vain.

111
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,950
My reckless action?

112
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,080
Lai Zhengyi,

113
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,510
didn't you say it?

114
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,350
You said, if it was not settled within three days,

115
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,430
you'd cancel this project.

116
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,630
I did so to save it!

117
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,510
Save?

118
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,710
Then what about now?

119
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,590
Have you saved it?

120
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,430
Did you ever think of the consequences

121
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,510
when you gave her money?

122
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,150
Did you discuss it with any of us?

123
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,680
I didn't think so much at that time.

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,710
I did it all for the project.

125
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,310
You...

126
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,430
Aren't you cash-strapped?

127
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,430
Where did you get the five million yuan?

128
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,510
I sold my car.

129
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,950
Lai Zhengling!

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,630
You're no longer a child!

131
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,990
Can you be even a little cautious when doing things?

132
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,430
You sold your car,

133
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,950
but have you settled things?

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,230
Alright.

135
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm foolish,

136
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,230
and I'm reckless.

137
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,670
You're the only smart person in the world!

138
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,630
Satisfied?

139
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,080
Now I've sold my car.

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,430
What else do you want me to do?

141
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,470
No one forced you to sell your car!

142
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,350
You're the fool who did it!

143
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,830
Okay...

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,790
I'm the fool.

145
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,320
Are you crying?

146
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,470
Nope.

147
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,190
Impossible.

148
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
I've never cried even once since my childhood.

149
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,070
It was the first time

150
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,630
I saw Mr. Lai so angry.

151
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,830
He's just a double-faced man!

152
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,480
He hides it so well normally.

153
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,670
Ding Dong,

154
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,190
do you also think I'm foolish?

155
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,470
You did so for the good of our company.

156
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,430
I know it.

157
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,230
I gave Zhang Xueying money,

158
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,040
because I wanted her

159
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,510
to clarify and explain.

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,870
I didn't expect her to post that!

161
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,670
You know what?

162
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,320
I really don't want to see this project canceled.

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,360
This was the first time

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,630
I wanted to do a good job seriously.

165
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,070
I don't want everyone to look down on me.

166
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,790
I don't want to always pale in comparison to Lai Zhengyi.

167
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,750
But Ding Dong, you know what?

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,750
Ever since our childhood,

169
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,840
Lai Zhengyi has been better than me in every respect.

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
I am my parents' biological son,

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
but they both favor him.

172
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,030
And you guys also favor him.

173
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,430
There will be someone who loves you.

174
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,910
Forget about it.

175
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,510
Don't comfort me.

176
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,870
I know.

177
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,590
I can only screw things up

178
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,789
rather than do anything right.

179
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,110
Ding Dong.

180
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,030
Mm...

181
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,520
Thank you.

182
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,200
This time, because of me,

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,990
everyone's effort is in vain.

184
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,070
You trusted me so much.

185
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,350
Sometimes I feel

186
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,720
my heart is filled with...

187
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,200
You didn't let me down.

188
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,670
You were just too naive,

189
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,630
and fell into Zhang Xueying's trap.

190
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,190
Don't worry.

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,390
We'll figure out a way.

192
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,600
Right?

193
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,310
I hope so.

194
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,020
[Zhang Xueying: Fight against the dark. And I finally see the light of hope.]

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,330
[Thank you for accompanying me during the battle.]

196
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,700
[But it's about time to put an end to everything.]

197
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,210
[I've received apologies from Lemeng, as well as their compensation.]

198
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:49,790
[A company which dares to admit its mistakes and shoulder the responsibility is worth forgiving.]

199
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm pissed off!

200
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,070
Zhang Xueying has gone too far!

201
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,040
I must find a chance

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,110
to teach her a lesson!

203
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,670
Lai Zhengling is also an idiot.

204
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,830
He paid five million yuan so easily!

205
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,190
What a rich man!

206
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
Maybe this...

207
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,710
is not a bad thing.

208
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,740
What?

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,550
Lai Zhengling gave the money personally.

210
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,230
What's it got to do with Lemeng?

211
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,920
What do you mean?

212
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,030
Anyway, you go meet Chen Tang first.

213
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,910
Leave the rest

214
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,750
to me.

215
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,830
I've used Qin Yanfei's account

216
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,790
to send messages

217
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,030
and clarified to have nothing to do with it.

218
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,710
I don't have to say too much about what the company should do, right?

219
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,710
We are already drafting the statement.

220
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,190
The press conference will be held half an hour later.

221
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,870
Though I dislike you,

222
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,270
I have to admit

223
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
you and I

224
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,160
have the best cooperation at work.

225
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,430
Same here.

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,860
[Lemeng Pictures: Lemeng didn't give Miss Zhang any compensation.]

227
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,800
All of them have denied it.

228
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,270
Then where on earth did Zhang Xueying get the money?

229
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,430
Out of nowhere?

230
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,230
Jeez!

231
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,390
It's a completely different story!

232
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,430
No way!

233
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,150
Did Zhang Xueying stage this play by herself?

234
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,710
Things are getting bigger now.

235
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,790
It's really interesting.

236
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,670
Here I confess.

237
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,710
I gave her that money.

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,530
Sorry, the subscriber you are dialing cannot be connected now.

239
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,120
What are they doing?

240
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,660
[Lemeng Pictures: Lemeng didn't give Miss Zhang any compensation.]

241
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,520
Chen Tang!

242
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
You have the right to remain silent.

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
Anything you say

244
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,440
can be used against you in court.

245
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Why are you targeting me?

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
I told you it was not me!

247
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,370
I didn't take your draft!

248
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
Chen,

249
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,400
you know me pretty well.

250
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,040
Today I asked you to come here

251
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,960
not to hold you accountable for anything.

252
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,960
If you know anything,

253
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
come clean now.

254
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,720
Things have been really serious now.

255
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,360
The truth matters a lot to us.

256
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,150
I've been your editor

257
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,470
ever since you started writing books.

258
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,990
We've cooperated for so long.

259
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,550
Don't you trust me?

260
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,230
Zhang Xueying is your ex-girlfriend.

261
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,800
If she didn't see the manuscript before,

262
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,280
why is her book

263
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,470
exactly the same

264
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,350
as “I'm a Maid in an Evil Cult”?

265
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,590
How would I know it?

266
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,390
You're so stubborn.

267
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,750
Next, please feel free to ask questions.

-Mr. Lai Jr.! -Mr. Lai Jr.!

271
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,230
Please tell us!

-What on earth happened? -Right!

273
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,950
Please say something.

274
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,560
Where on earth did Zhang Xueying get that money?

275
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,310
Please tell us.

276
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,990
Could you please explain it to us?

277
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,870
Right, Mr. Lai Jr.!

278
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,510
Please reveal a bit.

279
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,190
Do you know any information?

280
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,190
Do you know the story behind?

281
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,430
Zhang Xueying's money

282
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,470
was paid by me.

283
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,280
-What? -Really?

284
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,150
Because she blackmailed me.

What?

286
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,920
Why did you give her money?

287
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,670
Right!

Please wait.

We'll have the Q&A section later.

292
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,310
Now let me first tell

293
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,510
the real story to you.

294
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,750
We've put great effort into this project.

295
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,910
How could I just stand by and see it being ruined?

296
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
So,

297
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,270
I went to negotiate with Zhang Xueying.

298
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,270
But she

299
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,550
just asked for 5 million yuan as hush money.

300
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,430
Five million yuan.

301
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,870
If I didn't give it to her,

302
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,950
she would destroy our Lemeng Pictures.

303
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,470
And she also wanted to ruin

304
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,750
Qin Yanfei's reputation.

305
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,590
So I had no other choice

306
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,060
but to

307
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,590
sell my personal car

308
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,150
to give her five million yuan.

309
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,870
Then, Mr. Lai...

310
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,630
Then how was it

311
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,240
settled later?

312
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,830
After I gave her that money,

313
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,110
she promised me to make a statement.

315
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,320
The next day,

316
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,070
she did post a statement

317
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,310
on her Weibo.

318
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,590
But her statement

319
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,430
completely distorted

320
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,710
the truth.

321
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,430
She was telling lies.

322
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,790
So, my friends,

323
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,230
what you read before

324
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,990
has also been distorted by Zhang Xueying.

325
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,870
Today we hold this press conference

326
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,550
just to explain the real story

327
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,750
to you guys.

If they still refuse to cooperate,

341

just wait to receive the court summons.

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,990

See? It ranks first on Trend.

the police will investigate it.

362
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,590
As for you,

363
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,510
you can't get away with harboring her.

364
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,590
I didn't mean to do it.

365
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,630
On that day, after Yanfei and I finished the meeting,

366
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,070
I took his outline back home by accident.

367
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,790
When Zhang Xueying knew about it,

368
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,470
she just badgered me to let her have a look.

369
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,870
I really had no other way

370
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,870
but to give it to her.

371
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,950

At first,

373
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,790

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,390
we could also be banned from the industry.

379
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,200
So I dared not say it.

380
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm sorry.

381
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,110
-Come on... -Come on...

382
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,270
-Together, together. -Come on...

383
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,080
-Cheers! -Cheers!

384
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,790
Bro,

385
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,230
this is a toast to you alone.

386
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,470
Now you're finally proven to be innocent.

387
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,840
It was really a hard road.

388
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,550
The truth will always come to light.

389
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,120
But I didn't take it seriously.

390
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,640
But I must thank you all.

391
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,680
This is pretty good now.

392
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,640
I'll drink it up.

393
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,450
Please feel free to drink yours.

394
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,730
Come on! Here we go!

395
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,800
-Come on! -Cheers!

396
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Here we go...

397
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,040
Actually, we didn't help too much.

398
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,450
It was mainly Xiaoran who made great efforts.

399
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,330
Were it not for her persistence,

400
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,370
this project

401
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,410
would have been canceled long ago.

402
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,490
Right, Xiaoran!

403
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,490
You're so great!

404
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,280
Zhang Xueying had schemed for so long,

405
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,160
and you just turned the tables in one fell swoop.

406
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Actually, it's not just me.

407
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,650
No...

408
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,800
I also did a good job,

409
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,970
but it was mainly because

410
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,250
there was a skilled person helping me.

411
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
-Oh! -Oh...

412
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,010
So it's the couple's joint effort!

413
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,120
Then Zhang Xueying's really unlucky!

414
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,040
Well...

415
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,570
What skilled person...

416
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,610
Forget about it.

417
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,240
You were going to give up this project back then.

418
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,890
Right! Yes!

419
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,760
Don't forget Mr. Lai Jr.'s efforts!

420
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,080
He's also done a great job!

421
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,970
You're right!

422
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,450
-If Mr. Lai Jr. didn't give the money, -Yes!

423
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,400
this project

424
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,480
couldn't be saved so easily!

425
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,120
Right!

426
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
Listen,

427
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,130
it was all part of the plan.

428
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,480
Everything was a decoy.

429
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,690
It would be hard to catch her if I didn't sacrifice something.

430
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,370
You know?

431
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,730
It was just a test for you!

432
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,849
Come on... Together!

433
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,290
-Mr. Lai Jr. is both brave and resourceful! -Come on...

434
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,930
We really lucked out

435
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,050
to achieve our success this time.

436
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,160
In the future, we shall do things

437
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,410
more cautiously.

438
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,480
We're all reckless.

439
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,720
We're a group of fools.

440
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,890
Only you are the greatest.

441
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,329
You're the only smart guy,

442
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,690
and the only sensible man.

443
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,290
Only you're the major contributor!

444
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,210
Satisfied?

445
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,170
No...

446
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,810
Mr. Lai didn't mean that.

447
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,050
All of us are the major contributors.

448
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,880
Thank you, Mr. Lai Jr.

449
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,690
Come on! I propose a toast to Mr. Lai Jr.

450
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,810
-Come on. Thank you! -Thank you for your hard work.

451
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,730
I'm gonna leave now. Bye-bye!

452
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,850
Listen...

453
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,370
Listen to me first!

454
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,490
Do you know why

455
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,850
he treated me so arrogantly today

456
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
and accused me implicitly

457
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,170
and condescendingly?

458
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,050
You know...

459
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,650
He's drunk!

460
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,330
He's just jealous of me!

461
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,880
Mr. Lai Jr.!

462
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,320
Ding Dong,

463
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
please send him back.

464
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,170
Okay.

465
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,920
-Let's go back. -Listen.

466
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,650
Don't move me!

467
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,930
Stop moving me!

468
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm okay.

469
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,890
I'm really okay!

470
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,090
Why are you looking at me?

471
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,210
You! Why are you looking at me?

472
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,120
Go back now.

473
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,610
How vile you are!

474
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,120
You're so vile!

475
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,170
He's really vile!

476
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,680
He asks me...

477
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,050
He asks me to go back now

478
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,330
just to let my parents

479
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,880
scold me.

480
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,890
Am I right?

481
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,360
Wait!

482
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,450
Mr. Lai asks you to go back because he's caring about you.

483
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,520
You're so drunk now,

484
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,240
so you must go back home quickly!

485
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,450
Am I?

486
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,400
He's caring about me...

487
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,610
Nonsense.

488
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,810
Listen,

489
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,930
he looks like a good guy on the surface,

490
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,920
but in fact, he's always stabbing you

491
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,240
in the back.

492
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,960
-You're really drunk too much. -This is who he is.

493
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,090
-Let's go. -I'm okay.

494
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,010
I'm really fine!

495
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,530
Don't...

496
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,850
-Don't touch me! -Let's go... Okay!

497
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,360
I won't touch you!

498
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm fine!

499
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm really all right!

500
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,800
Lai Zhengyi.

501
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,200
Mom and Dad have thought highly of you since our childhood.

502
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,130
They have treated you, a man from another family,

503
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,960
like their biological son.

504
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,610
I've always been neglected.

505
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,010
And you're been a genius since childhood.

506
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,040
But why?

507
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,360
This time, you helped Lemeng

508
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,240
get through the hard times.

509
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,960
Mom and Dad are really exhilarated.

510
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,170
But what about me?

511
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,610
If I go home now,

512
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,410
I'll surely be scolded.

513
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,240
Like, "You can only screw things up

514
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,720
rather than do anything right.

515
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
There's nothing you can do.

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,970
You're a loser!"

517
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,050
They'll definitely say so.

518
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,570
As a member of the Lai family,

519
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,010
shouldn't I be

520
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,290
the chosen one?

521
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,970
But, listen, Ding Dong.

522
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,040
Ding Dong, Ding Dong!

523
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,010
Listen.

524
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,090
In the first year...

525
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,770
In the first year of our junior high school, you know.

526
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,170
I tried really hard

527
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,930
to get 98 points.

528
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
I really...

529
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,120
Do you know his score?

530
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,160
He scored...

531
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,170
He scored 100 points!

532
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,890
It was okay to me whether you

533
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,200
scored 96 points

534
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,880
or 69 points.

535
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,760
It was okay!

536
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,690
But he got 100 points!

537
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,080
You...

538
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,490
Were you targeting me?

539
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,690
Tell me the truth.

540
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,730
Were you targeting me?

541
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,890
He was not!

542
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,930
Bi Xiaoran, listen.

543
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,450
Now...

544
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,810
Break up with him right away.

545
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,330
Enough!

546
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,920
Break up!

547
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,450
Or your youth will be wasted.

548
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,770
Really, really!

549
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,080
How could you say so?

550
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,650
He's your elder brother, after all!

551
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,850
I see you as my elder brother,

552
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,970
but do you see me as your younger brother?

553
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,360
Of course, I do.

554
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,880
Why hasn't he come out yet?

555
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,530
It's been a long time!

556
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,450
-Don't move! -Come over!

557
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,970
It's said the boy called Lai Zhengling

558
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,770
in our primary school

559
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,920
is your younger brother.

560
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,400
No!

561
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,570
I don't have any younger brother!

562
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,050
Cut the crap!

563
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,170
I know it all!

564
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,520
Hey!

565
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,010
Do you know

566
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,650
what happened at that time?

567
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,400
Do you know

568
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,360
what happened after he

569
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,090
finished that talk?

570
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,480
No response at all!

571
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,330
And...

572
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,080
I even gave

573
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,320
my little toy car

574
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,760
tied with rope

575
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,440
to him to play.

576
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,450
That was my only

577
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,130
toy car without electricity.

578
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,610
Pull,

579
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,130
and slide.

580
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,730
Pull, and slide.

581
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,120
Really interesting.

582
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,810
Pull, and go.

583
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,250
Just the one with strings...

584
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,010
What are you thinking about?

585
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,730
Nothing.

586
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,330
I just think,

587
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,530
Lai Zhengling is quite a poor guy.

588
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Not at all!

589
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,850
Actually,

590
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,410
after I heard what he said,

591
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,200
I can understand him more or less.

592
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,730
He and I are both

593
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,610
siblings of the geniuses.

594
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,040
Sometimes,

595
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,280
we're quite stressed out.

596
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,440
No matter how hard we try,

597
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,520
we always

598
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,930
pale in comparison.

599
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,280
This is also true for me.

600
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,700
But I'm luckier than him.

601
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,260
Al least I know

602
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
my sister cares about me.

603
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,250
But he

604
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,700
is under the pressure from you on one hand,

605
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,740
and can't

606
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,860
get your recognition on the other hand.

607
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,740
What do you want to say?

608
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,020
Actually, after this time spent with him,

609
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,940
although Lai Zhengling is impetuous

610
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,010
and unruly,

611
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,050
I find

612
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
he's not a bad guy in nature.

613
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,100
He doesn't say it openly,

614
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,940
but every action he takes

615
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,780
is to get your recognition

616
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,100
and attention.

617
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,300
I've been on bad terms with him

618
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,340
for a long time.

619
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,500
He was just drunk and talked nonsense today.

620
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
It'll be fine after he wakes up.

621
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,100
But I think

622
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,900
he really cares about you.

623
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,580
But what about you?

624
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,710
Do you

625
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,830
see him as your younger brother?

626
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,670
All right, it's late now.

627
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,110
Time for bed.

628
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,550
Time to go to sleep.

629
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,990
I'm okay.

630
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,920
Sit down!

631
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,350
Sit still!

632
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,030
Wake up!

633
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,950
I feel uncomfortable.

634
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,270
Sit well.

635
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,030
What a double-faced,

636
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,430
ungrateful

637
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,240
and hopeless guy!

638
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
Sit well!

639
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,360
In fact, Mr. Lai

640
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,690
does care about you.

641
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,170
He's given you opportunities

642
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,170
at work both openly and secretly.

643
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,490
He's training you,

644
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,330
and helping you improve.

645
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,440
Though I don't know

646
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,090
what has happened between you,

647
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,400
there must be some misunderstandings

648
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,610
which remain unsolved.

649
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't try to convince me!

650
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,490
I didn't!

651
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,480
All right...

652
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,610
He's not helping me improve!

653
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,850
He's...

654
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,120
abusing my cheap labor.

655
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,730
I feel uncomfortable.

656
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,480
That's your bias!

657
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
So of course, you...

658
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,640
I feel uncomfortable.

659
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
What are you doing?

660
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,680
Let me sleep for a while.

661
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,490
Just five minutes.

662
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
I can't fall asleep.

663
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,840
Sing a song for me.

664
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,680

665

We're finally home!

676
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,330
The foreign ladyboys are really different.

677
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh my goodness.

678
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,770
Finally, we're home.

679
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,050
This...

680
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,520
Babe, be careful.

681
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
Dad! Mom!

682
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Xiaoran?

683
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,970
Hello, sir and madam.

684
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,960
What happened?

685
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,380
Hello, Mom.

686
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,570
Come back now!

687
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,440
Wait...

688
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,680
I'm still working.

689
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,690
It's improper to go home.

690
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,800
What work?

691
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,480
Quit it!

692
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,110
Hello?

693
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,930
Quit it?

694
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,690
Gosh!

695
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,950
Something bad happened!

696
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,840
[Luchi Xianting]

697
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,210
What did you do as her younger sister?

698
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,520
I was scared!

699
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,530
What?

700
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,130
Your sister...

701
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,040
Your sister has become like this!

702
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,360
And you didn't tell me!

703
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,960
I...

704
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,450
You brat...

705
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,840
She didn't allow me to tell you!

706
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,480
Calm down!

707
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,890
Calm down.

708
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,490
Mom,

709
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm okay.

710
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,330
That's just an accident.

711
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm really fine.

712
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,290
Are you kidding me?

713
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,560
W-what do you mean?

714
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,170
I just...

715
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,090
I just went out...

716
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,720
I went out

717
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,680
to play just for two months,

718
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,720
and you have become lame!

719
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,650
If I really went out

720
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,930
for a year or more,

721
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,680
could I still see you safe and intact?

722
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,250
Relax...

723
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,730
She's safe now!

724
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,280
Right! She's safe and sound.

725
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,730
You brat!

726
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,480
Your sister has become like this,

727
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,240
and you still went out to play, huh?

728
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,010
Were you in the mood to play?

729
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,250
I didn't go out to play!

730
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,440
I work in place of my sister every day!

731
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
I've worked so hard!

732
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm pissed off.

733
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,000
Right,

734
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,380
what happened between you two?

735
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,340
What happened?

736
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,740
You lifted her up when you just walked out.

737
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,580
Right!

738
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,060
This is also an accident.

739
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm her boyfriend!

740
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,180
What?

741
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,100
Sir, Madam, don't worry.

742
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,780
We're in a relationship

743
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,900
aiming for the marriage!

744
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,330
Being in a relationship without a goal for marriage

745
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,300
is too irresponsible!

746
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,420
We've already decided the date of marriage!

747
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,490
Qin Yanfei!

748
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,260
Date of marriage?

749
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,380
Have you really decided it?

750
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,140
N-no...

751
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,860
When?

752
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,090
Mom, where are you going?

753
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,820
Mom, no...

754
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,180
You've already decided the date of marriage, huh?

755
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
Mom...

756
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,940
-Mom! -Wait...

757
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,500
Do you wanna die?

758
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,580
You two!

759
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,140
I didn't lie!

760
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,500
What are you talking about?

761
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,020
Do you want to die?

762
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,060
I...

763
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,340
Wait...

764
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,780
-Mom! -Mom...

765
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,660
Calm down!

766
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,260
Easy, easy!

767
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,940
Sir, Madam!

768
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,100
We really love each other!

769
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,300
What are you doing?

770
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,380
I'm...

771
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,980
going to peel an apple

772
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,820
for my future son-in-law!

773
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,770
I was freaked out, Dad.

774
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,610
I was really scared.

775
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,780
Then...

776
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,620
what's the date

777
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,580
that you've decided?

778
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,060
April 4th in the next year!

779
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,940
It's a good day for marriage.

780
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,060
April 4th...

781
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,740
No!

782
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,500
April 4th,

783
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,660
doesn't sound like a good day!

784
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,980
It's not auspicious!

785
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,620
Choose another one.

786
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,380
You're right.

787
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Then what about March 3rd?

788
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,340
How about it, Dad?

789
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
How about March 3rd?

790
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,140
March 3rd!

791
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,090
I think

792
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,940
it should be February 18th!

793
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
February 18th!

794
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,900
February 18th...

795
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,860
Brilliant, Dad!

796
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,780
Mom!

797
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,900
I also have a boyfriend now!

798
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,700
Wait!

799
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,300
We're talking about your sister's business.

800
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,420
Get married on February 18th...

801
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,700
Dad!

802
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,220
I've found a son-in-law for you!

803
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,420
Just February 18th! It's good!

804
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,100
Go away...

805
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,970
Besides...

806
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,060
I was talking!

807
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,140
Come on! Stop messing up!

808
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,060
We're talking about your sister's business.

809
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,620
Come on, take some grapes.

810
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,020
Thank you, Mom.

811
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,850
Nice.

812
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,940
Eat some!

813
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,020
I want grapes, too!

814
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,250
There's nothing to do with you!

815
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,950
I...

816
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,340
Zhengyi,

817
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,300
Come back to have dinner after work, all right?

818
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,340
Mom,

819
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,180
I have a meeting in the afternoon.

820
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,820
It may end very late.

821
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,900
It's okay.

822
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,130
I'll wait for you.

823
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,380
I miss you.

824
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,740
-I really can't go back, Dad!

825
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,460
I still have

826
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,860
several meetings later.

827
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,260
I'm so important in the company now.

828
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,500
They all need me.

829
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,460
Cut the crap!

830
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,460
Your mom has prepared so many dishes.

831
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,620
Come home on time!

832
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,780
I see, Mom.

833
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,940
All right, Dad.

834
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,530
Mom?

835
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,890
Dad, Mom,

836
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,700
why did you call

837
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,180
both of us back?

838
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,220
You brat,

839
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,820
do we have to

840
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,420
call both of you back for any business?

841
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,780
The four of us

842
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,460
haven't had a meal together for a long time.

843
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,650
See?

844
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,780
Zhengyi has lost weight.

845
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,460
He must be too busy to have meals on time.

846
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,100
Come on, eat some shrimps.

847
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,890
Thank you, Mom.

848
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,740
There are so many things to settle in the company recently.

849
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,050
You've worked so hard.

850
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,180
Well done.

851
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,380
What did he do?

852
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,820
And you just praised him.

853
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,500
Things are not done by him alone!

854
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,580
There's so many employees in the company!

855
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,860
How dare you say that?

856
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,660
You've just made so much trouble

857
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,610
in your brother's company.

858
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,540
You didn't help at all!

859
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,460
See?

860
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,340
There you go again!

861
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,420
I've heard nothing!

862
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,650
Blah, blah, blah.

863
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,330
Whatever.

864
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,420
It has been long enough

865
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,780
since your suspension of schooling.

866
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,490
Go back to your school now.

867
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,900
Start having classes tomorrow.

868
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,660
Dad, Mom.

869
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,620
I want to tell you that I

870
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,580
don't want to go back

871
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,460
to study in that business school.

872
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,140
I want to be a racing driver!

873
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,580
What racing driver?

874
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,700
It's useless!

875
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Right!

876
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,300
What if you have an accident?

877
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,940
What should we do?

878
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,830
I don't care!

879
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,060
I've dropped out of school, anyway.

880
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,900
What did you say?

881
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,020
I said,

882
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,580
I've dropped out of school.

883
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,060
It's not a trifle thing!

884
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,940
Why didn't you

885
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,740
negotiate with us?

886
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,260
I did...

887
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,380
tell it to you.

888
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,100
But did our negotiation work?

889
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,700
Did you listen to me during our negotiation?

890
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,460
You...

891
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,100
Why do you

892
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,060
make trouble for us?

893
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,170
Why can't you

894
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,580
learn from Zhengyi?

895
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,530
Learn from Zhengyi?

896
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,460
I learn from Zhengyi.

897
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,700
I learn from you.

898
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,540
Okay?

899
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,100
Zhengyi,

900
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,940
Zhengyi,

901
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,740
Zhengyi.

902
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,180
You only have eyes for Zhengyi.

903
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,580
Was I adopted by you?

904
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,700
I really don't understand.

905
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,740
You already had Zhengyi back then,

906
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,130
so why did you give birth to me?

907
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,130
I'm nothing, all right?

908
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,780
Come back!

909
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,620
Leave him alone!

910
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,380
Mom!

911
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,690
Mom, Dad,

912
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,860
don't worry.

913
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,300
He's just childish.

914
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,380
I'll go persuade him later.

915
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,020
Okay.

916
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,380
Then I will count on you.

917
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,410
Don't fight against each other!

918
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,060
Yeah.
