00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,940
who sent Lai Zhengyi back to the room

198
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,020
the other day?

199
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
Why is she here?

200
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,460
This is the list of actresses

201
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,500
that we've picked.

202
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
They're all preeminent.

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,090
Have a look at it.

204
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,340
I've contacted Ye Shu'er and Meijia

205
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,980
just now.

206
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,660
Both of them can attend the audition

207
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,380
the day after tomorrow in the afternoon.

208
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,180
Okay.

209
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,540
What about Liu Yue?

210
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,420
Have you got in touch with her?

211
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,690
She...

212
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,660
I've checked it.

213
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,420
She seems to have no time for it.

214
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,060
J-just forget about it.

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,700
Then I'll go tell Director Wang.

216
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Mm.

217
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,020
Come on, Director Wang.

218
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,330
Thank you for your hard word lately, Director Wang.

219
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,420
Though the Journey of the Youth

220
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,500
has run into twists and turns,

221
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,420
I think good things never come easily.

222
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,060
I believe it'll surely become

223
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,210
the best work of Lemeng.

224
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
I'm flattered, Mr. Lai.

225
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,900
It's normal

226
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,700
for big projects

227
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,540
to meet some trouble.

228
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,180
Isn't it?

229
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,370
But don't worry.

230
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,340
I'll surely

231
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,140
finish the high-quality shooting,

232
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,570
without overspending.

233
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,500
It won't go over budget.

234
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,660
Thank you for your great help, Director Wang.

235
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,780
Come on.

236
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,300
Let's drink together.

237
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,700
Where's Xiaoran?

238
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,420
She's not here today.

239
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,220
She's going to look for the new heroine.

240
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,100
Do you have any suitable choices

241
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,060
to recommend?

242
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,330
Now that you've asked me so,

243
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,100
then let me frankly recommend an excellent actress.

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,780
I have a disciple.

245
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,940
She's acts very well,

246
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,250
and very vividly.

247
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,140
She can also well understand what I say.

248
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,780
Just one problem.

249
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,420
She's never played any leading role.

250
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,620
But this time,

251
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,700
I want to give her an opportunity.

252
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,780
Do you mean Liu Yue?

253
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,540
Yeah!

254
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,420
Liu Yue!

255
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes. She happens to be shooting a commercial today.

256
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Shall I ask her to come here to meet you?

257
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,220
Okay!

258
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,180
Come on, Mr. Lai.

259
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,060
This is a toast to you!

260
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,420
Come on.

261
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,860
Master.

262
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,820
Sorry, I'm late.

263
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,940
Yue, sit down!

264
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,380
This is our boss,

265
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,260
Mr. Lai.

266
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,060
Mr. Lai,

267
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,420
this is my disciple,

268
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,060
Liu Yue.

269
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,580
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lai.

270
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,700
We've met again.

271
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,820
Did you know each other?

272
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,340
I've had the pleasure of meeting her a few times.

273
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,060
Perfect.

274
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,140
How about this...

275
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,540
Since you've known each other,

276
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,060
then let me get this straight.

277
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,860
Yue,

278
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,980
the project, the Journey of the Youth

279
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,940
is going to have its heroine changed.

280
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,580
I want to recommend you.

281
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,100
Do you have the confidence

282
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
to win this role?

283
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,460
Master,

284
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,060
I am negotiating with staff of other plays recently.

285
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,500
But for the Journey of the Youth,

286
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,140
I can decline all of them.

287
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,900
Brilliant.

288
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,250
There's an audition the day after tomorrow.

289
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,620
I'm looking forward to seeing you there.

290
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,860
Thank you, Mr. Lai.

291
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,020
Here's a toast to you, Mr. Lai.

292
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,260
Be careful!

293
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,860
Well...

294
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
I'm always that clumsy.

295
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm so sorry.

296
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,460
Here you are.

297
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,020
Thank you, Mr. Lai.

298
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,940
Why are you in such a hurry to check out?

299
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,300
You haven't totally recovered yet!

300
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,660
I don't like to stay here.

301
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,340
It's the same to rest at home.

302
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,980
You don't need to worry about me.

303
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,660
But the point is that your injuries

304
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
haven't completely healed.

305
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,260
You need someone to take care of you, huh?

306
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,340
I can hire a carer.

307
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,460
No way!

308
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,220
It's not safe in that way.

309
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,060
Your identity is so special,

310
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,740
right?

311
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,060
What if the information is leaked?

312
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,620
More importantly, it costs a lot.

313
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,060
How about

314
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,740
letting me take care of you exclusively?

315
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
Just think about it!

316
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,540
No charge!

317
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,500
And I'm good at it.

318
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,260
Round-the-clock and all-round service!

319
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,700
How about it? Huh?

320
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
What's wrong?

321
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,140
Let me give you a hand spa.

322
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,580
You're so annoying.

323
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,620
Get away.

324
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,620
Why do you suddenly decide to go to your parents' home?

325
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,940
During this time,

326
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,420
Lili is still Bi Xiaoran.

327
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,460
So it's better for me to live here.

328
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,700
That makes sense.

329
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,460
You're right.

330
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,580
Come on.

331
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,940
Why are you...

332
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,970
Why are you taking off your clothes?

333
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,380
The smell of sterilized water in the hospital is too strong.

334
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm going to take a bath.

335
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,580
Yeah...

336
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,460
Let me help you.

337
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,740
Sister!

338
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,820
Sister...

339
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,380
You can do it

340
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,060
at least after your legs heal...

341
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,250
Why are you here?

342
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,660
It's said that your legs are better now.

343
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
So we come to visit you!

344
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,060
But I didn't expect

345
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,770
to interrupt you two like this.

346
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Interrupt them?

347
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,180
Isn't Qin Yanfei your ex-boyfriend?

348
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,460
It's a long story.

349
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,340
Seriously.

350
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,860
In the college,

351
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,220
our friends all had their girlfriends or boyfriends.

352
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,050
Only we two were single.

353
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,340
We're the last two left.

354
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,700
So,

355
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,940
one day...

356
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,700
Jiangjiang,

357
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,860
be my girlfriend!

358
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,260
Are you mad?

359
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
I'm pretty serious.

360
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,780
Do you love me?

361
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,300
We've been friends for so long,

362
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,380
and you love me, huh?

363
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,980
Oh, my God.

364
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm so unlucky.

365
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,540
It's not about

366
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,260
whether I love you or not.

367
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,500
I just wonder why

368
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
we're the last two

369
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,340
single people.

370
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,460
Why can they fall in love?

371
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,020
That makes us look like we don't fit in!

372
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,340
My world used to have two colors, black and white.

373
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,420
If you become my boyfriend,

374
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,780
there will only be black in my world!

375
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,300
I refuse.

376
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,220
Can you make a little progress?

377
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,740
You see them in love

378
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,660
and their public displays of affection every day.

379
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,540
Don't you feel jealous?

380
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,620
We can also enjoy the 50% discount

381
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,700
for the milk tea in the future!

382
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,860
Aren't you tempted?

383
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
That makes sense...

384
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,140
Then,

385
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
let's have a try?

386
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,580
Wait!

387
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,100
You know what? I bought

388
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,380
a really pretty game card today.

389
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,340
Stop!

390
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,700
My sister is at home today!

391
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,580
Keep it down.

392
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,020
Silence.

393
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,020
So what?

394
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,380
Can't I see your family?

395
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,500
She's really bad-tempered.

396
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,140
If you mess up with her,

397
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,220
you're done.

398
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,820
Are you twins?

399
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,100
Anyway, both of you

400
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,970
look gullible.

401
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,700
Why should I be scared?

402
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,900
Nonsense!

403
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,020
Go...

404
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,020
I'll go get a bottle of water.

405
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,180
Then hurry up.

406
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,940
Got it.

407
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,970
Where on earth have you been to get a drink?

408
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,740
Come on...

409
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,540
Let's play another round of game!

410
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,490
Let's break up.

411
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,620
What?

412
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,580
Why?

413
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,460
Hush!

414
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,340
Don't ask me.

415
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,010
I just don't like you anymore.

416
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,660
Why so suddenly?

417
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,660
Didn't you just...

418
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,340
I met

419
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,460
an angel just now.

420
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,420
She's the love of my life forever.

421
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,380
An angel?

422
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,820
Is it...

423
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,380
All right! That's it!

424
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,420
Bye! Take care of yourself.

425
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,860
Wait!

426
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,220
So,

427
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,940
my wonderful first love

428
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,140
didn't last over 18 hours.

429
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,260
It ended so fast.

432
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,210
So,

433
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,980
now the two of them are in a relationship.

434
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,540
Yes.

435
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,180
I was thought Mr. Qin

436
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,460
was courting someone he would never have.

437
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,060
But I didn't expect this flatterer

438
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,820
to make it

439
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,900
after so many years,

440
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,580

Pervert!

444
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,300
I see you as my friend,

445
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,500
and you want to be my brother-in-law!

446
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,540
How could you do that?

447
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
Jiang Lili.

448
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,620
Close the door.

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,620

Okay...

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

What did you say?

460
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,300
I don't like the way you said it!

461
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,900
What do you mean by "a secret lover"?

462
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,140
Isn't it?

463
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,100
Two years ago,

464
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
an article with the title of

465
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,940
"Bi Xiaoran's Secret Lover"

466
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
went viral on the Internet.

467
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,060
To address it,

468
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,180
it took me a lot of effort.

469
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,500
To be honest,

470
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
that article

471
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,580
was written

472
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,020
right by me!

473
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,220
Really?

474
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,380
No wonder I found it well written.

475
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,180
Just so so.

476
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,220
I'm flattered.

477
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,260
Good.

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,180
You're so great.

Xiaoran, I'll go take something from the car.

Do you have spare time to care about other people's affairs?

483

Why don't you concentrate on your own work?

Though she's never played any leading role,

she has excellent appearance,

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,540
it's not good for you

580
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
to shack up with others

581
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,980
without any guarantee.

582
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,140
Then just give me what's needed!

583
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:19,860
What?

584
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,060
Ah?

585
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,850
Nothing.

586
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,780
After you go back,

587
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,490
remember to take good care of yourself.

588
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,260
Don't worry!

589
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
After I go back home,

590
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,860
I'll never let me suffer a little.

591
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,570
And you, Mr. Lai.

592
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,060
You always work so hard

593
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,370
day and night,

594
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,580
without taking meals properly.

595
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,180
So...

596
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,620
Did I say anything wrong?

597
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,860
Nope.

598
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,100
I will learn to adapt to

599
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
the life without you.

600
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,220
Ah...

601
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,690
Who'll buy us coffee later?

602
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,580
Whose turn is it?

603
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,340
It's her turn.

604
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,980
It should be her.

605
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,900
My turn.

606
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,050
Come with me.

607
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,780
Bro,

608
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,260
take care.

609
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,180
Take care.

610
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,860
What's wrong?

611
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,060
Nothing!

612
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,140
Nothing.

613
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,700
Please.

614
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,940
You...

615
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,460
Mr. Lai,

616
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,930
I'm really running out of money!

617
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,820
Just 200 yuan!

618
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,700
For a meal!

619
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,540
Where's your monthly salary?

620
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,660
My monthly salary

621
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,860
is so little!

622
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,580
It's even not enough for our Jennifer

623
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,700
to do maintenance once!

624
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,140
How about this?

625
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
After I become CEO,

626
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,100
I'll give you a promotion and a raise.

627
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,900
Okay?

628
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,260
We've heard enough of it.

629
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
This needs to be adjusted.

630
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,500
Yeah.

631
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Let's note it down.

632
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,020
Okay.

633
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,780
Ladies...

634
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,260
I

635
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,580
am not up to evil things.

636
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,660
Could you please

637
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,540
scan it?

638
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,140
After I become CEO,

639
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,980
I'll surely give you a promotion.

640
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,540
And make you a regular employee!

641
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,020
All right.

642
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,730
Scan it.

643
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,540
I don't want it, too!

644
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,020
There's no other way.

645
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
My credit card has been suspended.

646
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,220
That jerk, Lai Zhengyi

647
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,460
only gives me 2000 yuan every month!

648
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,900
I used it all just in half a day!

649
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,860
I treat you as my friends.

650
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,300
Don't let me down!

651
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,820
Come on!

652
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,100
We also treat you as our friend!

653
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,780
Right!

654
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
B-but my wife...

655
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,220
I...

656
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,700
I've given all my money to with wife!

657
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,260
I really have no money!

658
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,530
What a loser!

659
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,210
How old are you?

660
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,540
Why do you let your wife manage your money?

661
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,700
It makes me starve, too.

662
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,180
What a man!

663
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,980
Money is...

664
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,700
Your lunch.

665
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,020
You borrow money from us every day.

666
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,980
We're all afraid of you.

667
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,100
Don't you know it?

668
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Remember to wash the bowl after you finish eating.

669
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,060
Sorry, Mr. Lai.

670
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,140
A man with dignity refuses food

671
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,740
handed out in contempt...

672
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,810
Smells so good!

673
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,260
There are also shrimps!

674
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,740
Nice.

675
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,140
Good morning, Mr. Lai.

676
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,860
Morning.

677
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,140
You're vacuuming.

678
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,660
Yeah.

679
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,540
Hey!

680
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,380
It's sucked in...

681
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,180
Mr. Lai! Mr. Lai!

682
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,140
Mr. Lai!

683
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,900
Are you all right?

684
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,620
Come on...

685
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,900
The curtain screws are loose.

686
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,300
I'll fetch the professional to fix them.

687
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,860
Leave it to me.

688
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,100
Go to rest on the sofa.

689
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,780
It's time to maintain them.

690
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,020
I should be here for him.

691
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,860
Your hands

692
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,300
are used to sign contracts,

693
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,100
rather than doing housework.

694
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,260
Don't do it again.

695
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,260
It's okay.

696
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,020
Everyone should learn to live independently.

697
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,980
What's this sound?

698
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,370
Have you washed the clothes?

699
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,420
Yes.

700
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,530
Then I'm going to hang them out.

701
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,180
Do I have the shirt in this color?

702
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,460
Ah?

703
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,660
This should be a white shirt.

704
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
You must have put it

705
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,340
with clothes in other colors,

706
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,460
so it's dyed to be like this.

707
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,370
And so is this one.

708
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,780
After I move out,

709
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,900
can he take care of himself?

710
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,290
You don't like carrots, huh?

711
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,100
Can you cut it evenly?

712
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,300
It'll finally be eaten,

713
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,180
so the shape doesn't matter.

714
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,420
Who can cut carrots into slices of the same size?

715
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,820
Let me teach you.

716
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,250
Come on.

717
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,660
There's no carrot left.

718
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
I've finished slicing.

719
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,980
Shall we cut one more carrot?

720
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,340
But there's no carrots now.

721
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,380
Then let's cut this green pepper.

722
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,580
Okay.

723
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,020
What's wrong?

724
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,980
Nothing.

725
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,300
I just think

726
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,380
that I can't eat the food you cook in the future.

727
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,180
I feel quite sad.

728
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,380
What a pity.

729
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,420
So sad...

730
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,660
Indeed.

731
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,220
What a pity.

732
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,540
Mr. Lai!

733
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,420
Remember to wear gloves when washing the dishes!

734
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,060
Don't get your delicate hands dirty!

735
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,820
I'm wearing them.

736
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,940
[Sister]

737
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Hello, sister.

738
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,980
What's wrong?

739
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,180
Why haven't you moved back yet?

740
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm too busy

741
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,860
these days.

742
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
And I have too many belongings

743
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,050
to pack.

744
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,060
I'll give you two days.

745
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,060
If you're still not home after that,

746
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,900
I'll go catch you back.

747
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,100
I work in the daytime

748
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,220
and sleep at night!

749
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,300
I really have little time!

750
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,780
Give me two more days!

751
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:18,780
Sister!

752
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,450
Something happened here.

753
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,060
Bye! Let's talk about it next time!

754
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,220
What's wrong?

755
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,860
Lili!

756
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,100
I don't know why,

757
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,580
but after I added some detergent,

758
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,620
the dishes have become so slippery!

759
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
Look...

760
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,460
Let go of that dish!

761
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,180
Leave it to me.

762
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,980
You've worked hard today.

763
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,860
Go have some rest.

764
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,740
I don't have any work now.

765
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,740
Let me continue.

766
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,220
No...

767
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,460
Go watch TV.

768
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,140
Give them to me.

769
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,660
And this...

770
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,420
Go to rest!

771
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,300
Well...

772
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,900
Just go!

773
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,540
Go to take a rest!

774
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,690
Go...

775
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,980
Just leave it to me!

776
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,100
Bye-bye!

777
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,700
I didn't expect

778
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,260
Mr. Lai to be so poor

779
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,370
at doing domestic chores.

780
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,020
How

781
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,900
can he live

782
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,420
without me in the future?
