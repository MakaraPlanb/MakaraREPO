00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,210
how can I let you pay back

195
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,660
this three million?

196
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,460
I feel guilty about this.

197
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,340
Since you have said so,

198
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,700
I will do what you say.

199
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,820
Thank you.

200
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,740
Go to bed early.

201
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Huh?

202
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,100
So early to bed?

203
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,450
No...

204
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
He goes to bed this early.

205
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,220
I can't believe it doesn't even work.

206
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,700
Forget it, don't think about it.

207
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,580
I need to go to bed, too.

208
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,980
Where are my pajamas?

209
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,170
Bye. I have a bad signal.

210
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm screwed.

211
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,420
He doesn't have my pajamas, does he?

212
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,380
He doesn't think

213
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm hinting at him

214
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,100
and seducing him, does he?

215
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,140
Oh, no.

216
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,420
Before he finds out

217
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
I must get my pajamas back.

218
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,540
Just pretend everything never happened.

219
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,940
Mr. Lai.

220
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,140
Mr. Lai.

221
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,620
Mr. Lai.

222
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,460
Mr. Lai.

223
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,860
I found it.

224
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,060
A man and a woman alone in the same room

225
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,420
is really dangerous.

226
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,060
No...

227
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,020
No.

228
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,580
I'm so sorry.

229
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm not going to do anything to you.

230
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,140
Sorry.

231
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,900
They are right,

232
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,700
women are duplicitous creatures.

233
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
No. You...

234
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,020
You...

235
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,960
It's not a hallucination?

236
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,180
I'm so sorry.

237
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,460
I thought it was a hallucination.

238
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,740
What goes through your head every day?

239
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,260
I had a high fever when I was young,

240
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,420
so my brain is not good.

241
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,900
You are so diligent today

242
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,020
for that plate, aren't you?

243
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,530
I was joking yesterday.

244
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,690
There is no need to count between us.

245
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,700
You don't have to pay

246
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,660
for that plate.

247
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,700
What?

248
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,620
Really?

249
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,940
I knew it.

250
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,380
Friends should not haggle over every ounce.

251
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,650
Then from tomorrow onwards,

252
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,620
we are good friends.

253
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,140
Although you are my fake brother-in-law,

254
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,820
if you have a crush on my sister,

255
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,100
I will do my best to help you.

256
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,140
I'll do my best to

257
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,980
help you get her.

258
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,180
I recognize you as my brother-in-law.

259
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,100
That won't be necessary.

260
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,540
Why?

261
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,180
Don't you like her?

262
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,820
I just...

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,620
Well, you've had a busy day.

264
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,740
Get some sleep.

265
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,340
Aren't you curious about whose stuff this is?

266
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,740
I understand.

267
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,780
This must be left behind

268
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,700
by someone beautiful, right?

269
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,020
For someone as young and talented as you,

270
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,460
there must be many admirers.

271
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,970
You can go now.

272
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,850
I'll leave then.

273
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,180
She's so stupid.

274
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,460
What should I do?

275
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,460
Qingyan.

276
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,140
Dad,

277
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,180
what took you so long to come back?

278
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,220
Did you find the heroine of The Journey of the Youth?

279
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,220
Bishop and Lai Zhengyi are tight lipped.

280
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,100
I asked several project managers,

281
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,420
but did not find out.

282
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,540
So what should we do?

283
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,620
She has now moved in with Lai Zhengyi.

284
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
Then won't Lemeng be hers in the future?

285
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,100
This crazy woman,

286
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,020
whatever I want

287
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,180
she is against me.

288
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,580
What a nasty woman.

289
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,480
Dad,

290
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
last time that driver clearly said that

291
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,620
he hit Bi Xiaoran.

292
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,220
Shut up!

293
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,580
Don't ever talk about it again.

294
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,220
If something leaks out,

295
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,180
our family will be done.

296
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,280
But the driver clearly said...

297
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,010
It's best if he doesn't hit her.

298
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,980
If he hit her,

299
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,900
and is still fine.

300
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
It means that she has known our plan for a long time.

301
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,460
She probably

302
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,740
has something on us.

303
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,180
Forget about it.

304
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,340
Do not mention it again.

305
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,730
[Lemeng Pictures]

306
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,530
Ding Dong.

307
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,780
Good morning.

308
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,980
I have good news.

309
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,140
Mr. Lai said we are friends.

310
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,780
I don't have to pay for that plate.

311
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,340
Really? He's that good?

312
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,380
This is not like his style of doing things.

313
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,620
Yeah.

314
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,580
I used to follow him in the gossip magazines

315
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,220
and Weibo.

316
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,900
I think he might be

317
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,740
a treacherous and cunning businessman.

318
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,260
I didn't expect him to be so nice.

319
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Look at you.

320
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,900
Didn't you say two days ago that

321
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,580
you would not live with him?

322
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,420
I didn't know him at that time.

323
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,260
I got such a great roommate,

324
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,980
what more could I ask for?

325
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,260
You slutty woman.

326
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,260
Did this girl send the wrong text message?

327
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,700
What's going on?

328
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,420
My idol is not your straw boats.

329
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,300
Don't show him your slutty ass!

330
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,530
Get out of from his house!

331
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,500
You're not good enough for him!

332
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,460
Looks like she didn't send the wrong person.

333
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,780
She was trying to send it to my sister.

334
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,940
What's wrong?

335
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,819
Nothing, just a few boring people.

336
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,780
OK, I'm going to work now.

337
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,220
Let you see what I can do.

338
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,770
I'm not going to listen to you

339
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,020
Your idol's chest

340
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,140
is warm and wide,

341
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,500
I don't want to leave it at all.

342
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,100
Sister Xiaoran,

343
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
The Casting results of The Journey of the Youth

344
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,540
have come out.

345
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,460
Director Wang and Mr. Lai decided to cast Tang Na.

346
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,660
This needs to be seen by you.

347
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,100
They asked you to go see her this afternoon.

348
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,660
OK.

349
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,100
Ok.

350
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,860
Then I'll send you

351
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,060
the time and place later.

352
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
Sister Xiaoran,

353
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,060
Do you remember

354
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,180
what you told me the last time we met?

355
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,860
God.

356
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,620
My sister wouldn't have said

357
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,140
something nasty again, would she?

358
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,660
You said I would definitely be cast as

359
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,010
the female lead in The Journey of the Youth

360
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
That's right.

361
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,860
As I said,

362
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,660
you sure can.

363
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,820
I've always wanted to work with you,

364
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,620
and I finally got the chance to do so this time.

365
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,500
You don't have to worry.

366
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,740
I will unconditionally cooperate with

367
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,660
all the arrangements of the cast of The Journey of the Youth.

368
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
However,

369
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,500
I have a request,

370
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,980
and I hope that Sister Xiaoran can grant me.

371
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,460
Go ahead.

372
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,980
I just took over

373
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,420
a reality show,

374
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,220
and there are some conflicts with the filming schedule of

375
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,500
The Journey of the Youth.

376
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,220
So I was wondering if the crew could

377
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,300
finish filming my at one time?

378
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,260
Try to have me finish filming within two months.

379
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,940
This way

380
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,980
I can explain to the other crew,

381
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,860

570
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,290
Come on, everyone, let's go!

571
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,650
Then we can only do it.

572
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Let's go.

573
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
Is she that aggressive?

574
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,370
Does she like to climb mountains?

575
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,970
Because she is Bi Xiaoran now.

576
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
I can't do it anymore.

577
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,770
I can't walk a step.

578
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,650
Just

579
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,650
bury me here.

580
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,930
Did you just vow to reach the top?

581
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,050
How can you say you're tired now?

582
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,090
It's not like that.

583
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,290
I don't know myself

584
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,570
very well.

585
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,050
Bi Xiaoran is really different from the average person.

586
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,130
I'm dead.

587
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Hurry up!

588
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,570
Zhengyi!

589
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,600
What a coincidence!

590
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
I was just shooting a commercial on the mountain.

591
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,160
You...

592
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,970
you guys come to do the location search?

593
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,010
Yeah.

594
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,010
Sister Xiaoran is also there?

595
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,730
Hi.

596
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,930
You sweat a lot.

597
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,810
Handkerchiefs tend to harbor bacteria.

598
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,490
I'll just use a tissue.

599
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,320
Ren Qingyan.

600
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,000
She must have been a hoe in a previous life.

601
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,490
She is so fond of pestering Sister Xiaoran's favorite man.

602
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,090
This time she should come out

603
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,810
to defend her sovereignty.

604
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,450
Zhengyi, have some water.

605
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,130
Where is the water?

606
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,080
I really didn't bring any.

607
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,930
Thanks.

608
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,970
I'm also a little thirsty.

609
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,880
Do you mind if I

610
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
drink the same bottle of water with you?

611
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes, I do mind.

612
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,450
Huh?

613
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,370
Is he that direct?

614
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,880
Why haven't I seen him like this before?

615
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,210
It's true.

616
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,920
Drink some water and take rest.

617
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
What?

618
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,890
There are a billion bacteria in the human mouth.

619
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,330
This is the last bottle of water.

620
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,170
I wouldn't have drunk it if I had known.

621
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,250
I didn't expect

622
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,890
you would mind so much.

623
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,490
I don't mind.

624
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,930
When did I say

625
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,610
I minded?

626
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,050
This is a really good bottle of water.

627
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,610
By the position of the fifth episode.

628
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,370
In the fifth episode,

629
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,730
I think the chase scene

630
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,330
can be shot here.

631
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,130
Look.

632
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,210
The venue here is quite nice.

633
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,370
Isn't it?

634
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,910
That...

635
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,770
The scene where the hero and heroine are healing

636
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,090
can be shot right in that location.

637
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,480
The farewell scene

638
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,410
can be shot right here.

639
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,050
Look.

640
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,880
The depth of field is also quite good.

641
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,010
This way the shot will also be very layered.

642
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,770
Xiaoran.

643
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,810
If only Ponting was half

644
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,450
as obedient as you.

645
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,200
What?

646
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,290
What did you mean?

647
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,770
I didn't mean anything else.

648
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,090
I just thought you were so obedient to Director Wang.

649
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,840
If others don't know,

650
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,120
they'll think you're sucking up to Director Wang.

651
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,730
We are just working.

652
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:19,770
Sister,

653
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,490
it's not the first time Xiaoran and I have worked together,

654
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,240
and do you mean that I chose a bad scene?

655
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,120
No, I didn't mean it that way.

656
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,200
When did you ever

657
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,530
choose a bad scene?

658
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,160
Zhengyi.

659
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,130
How about we take this scene

660
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,930
as the first shot in the first episode?

661
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:32,920
This scene is good.

662
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,610
Take a picture of there.

663
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you see that place?

664
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,210
The camera will be set up in that position.

665
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,930
Xiaoran,

666
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,760
-Come here for a second. - The camera will be facing that way.

667
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,680
If you see a nice scene,

668
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,410
remember to take a picture of it.

669
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:45,810
Okay.

670
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,560
In case you forget it

671
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,500
Ok.

672
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,090
Look at this scene,

673
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,650
I think it's pretty good.

674
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,890
Director Wang,

675
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,330
that's about it for today.

676
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,210
Okay.

677
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,320
Thanks for your work.

678
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,690
Thanks for your work, Director Wang.

679
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,640
Thanks.

680
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,960
Let's all take a break.

681
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,330
-Okay! -Thank you, Director Wang.

682
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,090
Thanks, Director Wang.

683
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,320
Bye.

684
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:07,770
Let's go.

685
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,780
Okay.

686
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,300
Let's go.

687
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,440
My foot hurts so much!

688
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,530
Zhengyi,

689
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,720
I sprained my foot.

690
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Can you help me?

691
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,570
Xiao He.

692
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,280
Me?

693
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,290
-Wait for me. -Let's go

694
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,850
No...

695
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,850
Get up. The road is slippery.

696
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,010
I'll hold you up.

697
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,890
No, I walk very steadily.

698
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,570
Hurry up!

699
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,930
No one would let someone else apply a mask to themselves, right?

700
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,610
[Hampton]

701
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
My waist...

702
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,610
It's too hard to be a producer.

703
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,960
It's not as comfortable as I am as a paparazzi.

704
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,250
My back hurts after climbing the mountain.

705
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,010
God.

706
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,160
I have to take a shower and go to bed.

707
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,410
Tomorrow is another day full of energy.

708
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,660
Ah!

709
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,410
Why are you in my room?

710
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,690
This is my room.

711
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,970
I thought this is the bathroom.

712
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,050
I didn't see your abs,

713
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,770
pecs and mermaid line.

714
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,130
These two rooms are interconnected.

715
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,850
Never mind.

716
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,490
Even if you did,

717
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,530
I wouldn't hold you responsible.
