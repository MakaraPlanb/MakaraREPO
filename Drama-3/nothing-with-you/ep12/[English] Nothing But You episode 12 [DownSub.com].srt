Why would you ask that?

turn into a fly?

274
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
It is a shame about knockoff.

275

The imitation is so bad that I can't look it directly.

276

genuine ones to steal your stuff?

Please start your show.

583
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,370
How do you play erhu

584
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,940
by using violin?

585
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,500
Skip this song.

586
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,140
Skip this song.

587
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,490
The violin solo can be

588
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,390
performed like a band, really?

589
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,050
I want to go to the toilet.

590
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,220
Alright. Go!

591
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,980
Come here!

592
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,210

wait a moment please.

594
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,540
I will be back soon.

595
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,020
Shit.

596
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,450
What are you doing here?

597
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,660
Your sister asked me to supervise that

598
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,410
you must split with him.

599
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,970
Can you be a little normal?

600
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,140
Split with him right now.

601
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,200
She is crazy.

602
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,380
Are you crazy too?

603
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,860
Come here to perform cosplay!

604
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,750
I don't want to do that.

605
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,280
But I have no choice.

606
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,070
Are you forced?

607
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,160
I know you!

608
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,400
You will lose your bearings

609
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,480
when my sister smiles.

610
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,670
Are you forced?

611
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,510
You don't understand.

612
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,250
A thousand dollars is hard to buy a beauty‘s smile.

613
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,040
You don't understand.

614
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,910
I don't care.

615
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,280
Your sister gave me a rigid order.

616
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,640
I have to witness your breakup today.

617
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
Mind your own business.

618
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:55,960
Whatever.

619
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,030
You've come here.

620
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,070
Go to the toilet, ok?

621
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,630
[Toilet]

622
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,670
Well,

what you said has

624
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,840
made me have a feeling.

625
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,880
Just pee a little.

626
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,230
Hold it!

627
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,510
Give me two minutes.

628
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,480
Don't run around!

629
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,270
Hurry up!

630
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,500
[Toilet]

631
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,530
Where are we going next?

632
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,370
[Romon U-park]

633
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,360
Here.

634
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,200
Alright.

635
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,990
Dating should do

636
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,670
what dating should do.

637
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,830
So nice!

638
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,670
I like amusement park very much.

639
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,400
Xiaoran.

640
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,440
Hello.

641
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,550
What's going on?

642
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,390
They are into a ferris wheel.

643
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,630
Then?

644
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,470
Then...

645
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,880
Then I am afraid of heights.

646
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,590
You know.

647
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,030
I can't get into.

648
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,070
What?

649
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,920
Ok, go to have a rest.

650
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,870
So useless.

651
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,110
You can't blame me for this fear of heights.

652
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,350
I am damn single.

653
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,990
But I have to see them dating.

654
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,430
So beautiful!

655
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,360
Sure enough,

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
love this place.

658
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,440
No one else disturbs here.

659
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,050
This is the real date!

660
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,160
I like to get into the ferris wheel most.

661
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,120
Mr. Lai.

662
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,570
Have you heard the

663
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,290
legend about the Ferris wheel?

664
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,480
Say it now.

665
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,290
It is said that

666
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,640
a couple can be together forever

667
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,850
by kissing at the top of

668
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,040
the ferris wheels.

669
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,720
Really?

670
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,810
If you want to kiss me,

671
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,200
you can say it directly.

672
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,050
We

673
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
break up.

674
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,720
What?

675
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,720
I say

676
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,520
we break up.

677
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,760
Did Bi Xiaoran tell you something?

678
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,000
My sister is right.

679
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,970
We're a pretend couple.

680
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,200
And I've always

681
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
been a stand-in.

682
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,870
I want to end the love as soon as possible

683
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,370
so that no evidence can

684
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,650
be left in the future.

685
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,210
Are you sure?

686
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,560
Is this what you want?

687
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,450
Ok.

688
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,920
I respect your choice.

689

[Mind your head]

690
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,440
Wait a moment.

691
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,250
Anything else?

692
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,890
We want to sit again.

693
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,930
Ok.

694
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,900
There is no need.

695
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,140
I haven't finished speaking yet.

696
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,290
Again.

697
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,980
Alright.

698
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,420
I haven't finished telling the legend

699
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,540
of the ferris wheel just now,

700
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,900
do you want to continue listening?

701
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,420
It is said that

702
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,300
a couple can be

703
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,820
together forever by kissing at the top

704
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,300
of the ferris wheels.

705
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,740
But the premise is that

706
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,780
they must be truly in love,

707
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,740
a true couple.

708
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,220
What are you doing?

709
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,620
I have always been

710
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,020
with you

711
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,180
as Bi Xiaoran,

712
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,860
but Bi Xiaoran doesn't like you,

713
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,060
so I just

714
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,060
broke up with you

715
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,380
as Bi Xiaoran,

716
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,740
and now the person who get into the ferris wheel with you

717
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,500
is Jiang Lili.

718
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Jiang Lili likes you.

719
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,820
Would you like to be with her?

720
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,100
You don't have to promise me soon.

721
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,500
You can think about it carefully.

722
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,010
I am sorry.

723
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,060
We want to sit again.

724
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,130
Oh,

725
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,080
ok.

726
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,520
You are really a torturous person.

727
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,290
It has circled three times,

728
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,600
why haven't you come down yet?

729
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,570
What the young people did is harmful to the morals.

730
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,719
The moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day.

731
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,810
Forget it!

732
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,960
I don't care.

733
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,719
Who wasn't crazy

734
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,170
when they were young?

735
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,050
I will try it with Xiaoran in the future.

736
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,690
Wait a minute.

737
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,840
What do you mean?

738
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,080
Have you promised me?

739
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Hurry up!

740
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,190
We're almost at the top.

741
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,020
Oh!
