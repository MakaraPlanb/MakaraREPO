00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,620
Because I don't believe

193
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,900
what others say.

194

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,620
You are a good person.

196
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,580
I believe it.

197
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,460
Because you don't know me well.

198
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,020
Why did you say that?

199
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,090
When my sister had an accident,

200
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,340
you arranged the best sanatorium

When I made mistakes at work,

203
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,760
you didn't blame me.

204
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,780
Instead, you helped me.

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,900
Besides, I am actually a little careless.

206
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,980
You take special care of me.

207
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,300

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,140

Do you have abs?

Let me take a look.

Just let me take a look.

Can't I just take a look?

218
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,380
Just let me have a glance.

You took advantage of me.

231

Taste the sweetness.

Am I kidnapped?

When I woke up,

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,180
I found my hands were bound.

241
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,180
I thought I was kidnapped.

Who did that?

243
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,420
Did that hurt you?

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,300
You did that?

Yes.

Last night,

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,420
you were actually a little rude.

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,540
Rude?

You are sweet.

It's more exciting than my illusion.

had such a strong delayed effect.

00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,320
it doesn't matter whether you play more or less.

Otherwise,

310
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,470
can we try to make the play center on the heroine?

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,990
it will also receive recognition.

How can the script be revised casually?

382
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,430
You kicked me just now.

383
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,470
-We grew up together.
-Let me go.

384
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,950
I can recognize you even when you become ashes.

385
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,880
Say. Where is your sister?

386
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,750
What's the matter?

387
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,030
Let her go.

388
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,800
Stop.

389
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,790
What are you doing?

390
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,470
Mr. Lai. I know him.

391
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,950
This is...

392
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,110
I am her boyfriend.

393
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,630
Nonsense.

394
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,750
Say it again.

395
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,750
I'm not your boyfriend?

396
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,670
He's my e-ex...

397
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,800
Ex-boyfriend.

398
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,870
Ex-boyfriend.

399
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,280
When did you have a love affair with others?

400
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,070
Why didn't I know that?

401
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,160
That is over-past.

402
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,350
Let me introduce him to you officially.

403
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,990
This is the original author and scriptwriter

404
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,270
of the Journey of the Youth,

405
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,260
Qin Yanfei.

406
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,950
This is...

407
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,630
I know. Mr. Lai.

408
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,760
Nice to meet you.

409
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,069
Qin,

410
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,630
actually, there is a matter

411
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,150
I've been hiding from you.

412
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,589
Say it frankly.

413
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,330
As long as it isn't that your sister is nurturing the fetus,

414
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,280
I can accept everything.

415
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,460
It isn't a bad thing.

416
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,470
It's a good thing to contribute to the country.

417
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,660
In fact, she is working for the country.

418
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,030
When she disappears,

419
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,070
she is participating in

420
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,750
a space project.

421
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,390
Soon she will land on Mars.

422
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,350
This... This...

423
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,510
Is it

424
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,470
the Mars-crossing project?

425
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,150
You also know this project?

426
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,430
You are quite a great writer.

427
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,150
You are well informed.

428
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,150
That's it.

429
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,350
No. Jiangjiang.

430
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,870
Do you treat me as a three-year-old child?

431
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,400
You photoshopped the picture like that. How can I believe it?

432
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,670
When I was traveling abroad,

433
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,830
I heard your sister

434
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,630
was living together

435
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,000
with Lai Zhengyi.

436
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,520
Tell me!

437
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,040
Where is your sister?

438
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,210
Calm down.

439
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,310
Put your gun down.

440
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,230
My sister...

441
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,280
Do you still treat me as your brother?

442
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
You don't believe me.

443
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,070
Say.

444
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,570
Sorry, Qin.

445
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,880
It isn't that I don't want to tell you.

446
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,810
Mr. Lai told me to keep it secret.

447
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,050
I...

448
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,450
My sister...

449
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,990
My sister...

450
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,870
Bi Xiaoran is going on a business trip to Australia.

451
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,130
Her work is confidential.

452
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,470
So, her tracks can't be known by others.

453
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,740
What kind of work should be kept confidential?

454
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,830
It's our company's confidential information.

455
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,790
I can't tell you.

456
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,270
Right.

457
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,190
The company's confidential information.

458
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,150
You can't know that.

459
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,750
Well.

460
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,610
Don't think too much.

461
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,720
She will come back in a few days.

462
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,670
Where is she in Australia?

463
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,510
I am going to find her now.

464
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,600
No. No.

465
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,750
You don't need to find her.

466
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,310
There is something more important

467
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,310
waiting for you.

468
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,790
What's wrong with your sister?

469
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,910
Someone made trouble in the film crew.

470
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,130
You need to deal with it.

471
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,120
I am just a scriptwriter.

472
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,490
I only need to write a good script.

473
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,120
Deal with the matter of the film crew by yourself.

474
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,160
It has nothing to do with me.

475
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,070
There is one more important thing.

476
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,350
Is there something wrong with your sister?

477
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,270
Not my sister.

478
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,830
It's me.

479
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,310
Sorry, Mr. Lai.

480
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,430
It's all about the company.

481
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,310
I live with Lai Zhengyi in place of my sister.

482
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,950
A man and a woman

483
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,870
stay in a room together.

484
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,110
I doubt...

485
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,600
See the way he looks at me.

486
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,280
He absolutely has an improper thought on me

487
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,520
and wants to misconduct himself with me.

488
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,550
No.

489
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,240
Have you ever

490
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,670
come across such a good thing?

491
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,870
You should feel happy.

492
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,070
I think it's impossible.

493
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,910
He doesn't look like

494
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,520
an unfastidious man.

495
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,510
Don't act like a snob.

496
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,510
You are not choosy.

497
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,510
I am so beautiful

498
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,830
and charming.

499
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,550
It's very dangerous for me.

500
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,450
Are you my brother?

501
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,960
Yes.

502
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,430
So, you can't go anywhere else.

503
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,030
Stay here to protect me.

504
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,910
Lodge?

505
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,030
Right...

506
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,310
The water pipe in his house burst.

507
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,510
He'll lodge here for several days.

508
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,720
I can book a room in the hotel for Mr. Qin.

509
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,710
He isn't used to living in the hotel.

510
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,750
He will suffer from insomnia.

511
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,350
Yes.

512
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,510
How about his friends?

513
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,190
He is of an uncommunicative and eccentric disposition.

514
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,990
He has no friends.

515
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,430
Since he is homeless

516
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,470
and so pitiful,

517
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,270
Mr. Lai,

518
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,710
please allow him to lodge here for several days.

519
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,630
Just a few days.

520
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,550
Since he is your friend,

521
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,960
I certainly welcome him.

522
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,110
You are magnanimous, Mr. Lai.

523
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,560
Let's have lunch.

524
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,450
Have lunch.

525
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,250
This is tomorrow's schedule.

526
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,930
Have a look.

527
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,530
No.

528
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,730
As for the matter of adding your parts,

529
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,040
we can discuss it later.

530
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,690
But you still should complete your work.

531
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,170
After all, you've signed the contract.

532
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,240
I have had a cold and a fever.

533
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,210
I can't work.

534
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,320
[Lemeng Pictures]

535
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,970
Wait for me.

536
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,520
Sit down.

537
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,690
Sit down, please.

538
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,410
Sit well.

539
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,210
Just a minute.

540
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,330
This is the cake for you.

541
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,450
Why did you suddenly

542
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,400
buy a cake for me?

543
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,530
Because I bothered you again.

544
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,930
One more person is living in your house.

545
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,850
I allowed Qin Yanfei to live here

546
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,130
just for the sake of silencing him.

547
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,240
Otherwise, he'll always ask

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,250
to find my sister.

549
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,050
Right?

550
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,690
Yes.

551
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,370
I know.

552
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,570
You take the whole situation into consideration.

553
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
You understand me.

554
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,680
Open it.

555
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,650
Open it to have a look.

556
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,290
What's wrong?

557
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,770
I know. I know.

558
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,610
I bought it for you.

559
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,250
I should open it for you.

560
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,850
I know you like blueberry.

561
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,690
I specially chose this kind of cake

562
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,320
with the most blueberries.

563
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,650
It's hard to choose.

564
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,970
Is it OK?

565
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,450
Do you like it?

566
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,770
You don't have to thank me.

567
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,610
What's wrong?

568
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,410
Did you quarrel with Lai Zhengyi?

569
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,280
No.

570
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,560
No?

571
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,490
Then why did you send him the blueberry cake?

572
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,480
He likes blueberry

573
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,410
and then I like sending it to him.

574
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,130
Any problem?

575
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,770
Yes.

576
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,280
There is a big problem.

577
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,930
I don't know whether he likes blueberry.

578
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,570
But I know

579
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,810
he suffers from trypophobia.

580
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,810
When he was a kid,

581
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,130
I often frightened him with a seedpod of the lotus.

582
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,210
He was frightened

583
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,520
out of his wits every time.

584
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,130
So, you put the blueberries in that shape.

585
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,720
Wasn't it to disgust him?

586
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,570
I know you like blueberry.

587
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,850
I specially chose this kind of cake

588
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,160
with the most blueberries.

589
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,730
Well...

590
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,450
I think he likes blueberry.

591
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,930
So, I sent him more

592
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,370
and put them in a lovely shape.

593
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,890
Who knows he suffers from trypophobia?

594
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,600
Now you know that.

595
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,360
Wait...

596
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,610
You have been with him for so long.

597
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,890
How can you not know that?

598
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,770
I attend to numerous affairs every day.

599
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,770
I am so busy.

600
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,290
It's normal for me to neglect that.

601
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,570
Xiaoran,

602
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,490
Ren Qingyan disappeared.

603
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,450
What?

604
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,450
What happened?

605
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,010
How's it going? How's it going?

606
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,360
Look.

607
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,960
I have phoned her many times.

608
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,890
No one answered my call.

609
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,210
What's wrong?

610
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,640
Ren Qingyan disappeared.

611
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,610
And she didn't answer the call.

612
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,130
Could she have an accident?

613
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,850
It's impossible.

614
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,600
She and her car both disappeared.

615
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,640
Well.

616
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,360
Find a stunt actress to act first.

617
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,930
Mr. Lai.

618
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,410
It happened suddenly.

619
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,320
It's hard to find a suitable

620
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,250
stunt actress.

621
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,610
Xiaoran,

622
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,010
can you come to help us?

623
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
What?

624
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,000
Me?

625
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,290
Director,

626
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,090
the stunt actress is ready.

627
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,730
OK.

628
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,050
Let me have a look.

629
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,930
You are pretty

630
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,800
in the ancient costume.

631
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,170
But I don't look like

632
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,010
Ren Qingyan.

633
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,970
Will the audience find it out?

634
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,930
It doesn't matter.

635
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,850
We won't expose your face.

636
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,810
Please feel at ease.

637
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,650
Go inside...

638
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,240
Where...

639
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,250
Where should I go?

640
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,360
No one told you?

641
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,970
This is a scene

642
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,080
where the hero and the heroine take a bath together.

643
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,130
You'll flirt with him in the water.

644
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,210
What?

645
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,490
Seduce him in the water?

646
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,090
Seduce?

647
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Yes.

648
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,360
All right. All right. Come.

649
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,800
Ziyi, help her.

650
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,810
OK. Director.

651
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,970
In the water?

652
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,970
Every department, get ready.

653
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,410
We'll start soon.

654
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,690
Be ready for real scene shooting.

655
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,090
Three, two, one.

656
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,640
Action.

657
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,230
[They two are in complete harmony and kiss recklessly]

658
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,610
In complete harmony.

659
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,130
Kiss recklessly。

660
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,690
Director Wang,

661
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,650
let's find a professional

662
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,440
stunt actress.

663
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,240
I'll make the arrangement.

664
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,120
Give you one more day.

665
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,890
No.

666
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,570
The scene will be gone tomorrow.

667
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,010
And you can't restrict

668
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,450
Xiaoran's development.

669
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,440
This is acting, acting.

670
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,240
It's false, false.

671
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,930
Cut. Cut.

672
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,450
Well.

673
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,090
Xiaoran,

674
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,160
be more devoted.

675
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,240
One more time.

676
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,680
OK?

677
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:10,880
OK.

678
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,400
Restart.

679
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,170
Again.

680
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,240
Be ready for real scene shooting.

681
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
Three, two, one.

682
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,810
Action.

683
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,490
Cut. Cut. Cut.

684
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:31,890
Xiaoran,

685
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,490
be more devoted.

686
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,130
OK?

687
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,880
Let's try one more time.

688
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,970
You did well just now. Not bad.

689
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,520
One more time.

690
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,370
Cut. Cut. Cut.

691
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,090
It isn't OK.

692
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,410
Xiaoran,

693
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,650
this is a scene of seducing the hero.

694
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,810
You must be more devoted.

695
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,770
Be more charming and enchanting.

696
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,520
All right?

697
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,970
Enchanting...

698
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,930
Director,

699
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,050
let's remove this part.

700
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,160
Ah?

701
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,930
Ah?

702
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,040
No.

703
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,130
It's very important for the whole TV series.

704
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,840
If you can't do that,

705
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,530
don't force yourself.

706
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,210
I can't give up halfway.

707
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,890
Let me try one more time.

708
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,480
One more.

709
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,250
OK. It's the last time.

710
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,840
If you can't do that,

711
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,680
I'll find another person.

712
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,490
OK.

713
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,000
Come on, Xiaoran.

714
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,210
OK. OK.

715
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,490
Get ready, every department.

716
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,720
Come. Be ready for real scene shooting.

OK. Perfect.

Perfect.

722
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,610
Xiaoran, well done!

723
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,250
Great.

724
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,130
Thank you.

725
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,040
What's this?

726
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,490
Didn't I get clean?

727
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,090

What's this?

733
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,090
It's definitely because the water in the barrel

734
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,090
is too dirty. You are allergic.

735
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,800
Ah?

736
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,680
It is very itchy.

737
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,290
Will I die?

738
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,570
Don't worry. It's OK.

739
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,370
Let me fetch some medicine.

740
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,010
OK.

Your fingers are so cold.

746
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,290
Don't move.

747
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,650
Sorry.

748
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,970
Why did you apologize?

749
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,970
The cake I sent to you

750
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,210
brought you the psychological shadow, right?

751
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,570
You don't know it, so it's okay.

752
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,680
I don't blame you.

You are so nice to me,

but I don't know you at all.

755
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,450
So, in the future, you

756
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,490
can only fix your eyes on me.

757

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,010
Tonight,

764
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,290
I will let you know who I am.

765
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,970
In this life,

766
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,520
you can't escape.

767
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,130
No.

768
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,480
We can't do that.

769
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,130
What?

770
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,170
Nothing. Nothing.

771
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,330
Sorry.

772
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,490
I'm not intended.

773
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,690
Give it to me.

774
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,840
I'll do it by myself.

775
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,210
Just go take a rest.

776
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,840
Go!

777
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,010
Bye.

778
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,530
I did that again.

779
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,410
It's too embarrassing.

780
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,810
Jiang Lili,

781
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,960
you are an idiot

782
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,730
contaminated by novels on overbearing presidents.

783
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,890
What am I thinking about every day?

784
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,250
It's too embarrassing.

785
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,680
My God.

786
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,130
I am really...

787
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,990
[Qin Yanfei]

788
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,330
Hello?

789
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,160
Bro, get started.

790
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,930
OK.
