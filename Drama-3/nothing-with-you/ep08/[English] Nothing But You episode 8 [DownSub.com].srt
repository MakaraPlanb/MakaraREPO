I should go.

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,410
That's eye-opening.

Why did you stay here at this time today?

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,780
Smells like saliva.

384
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,220
I thought this was expired mineral water.

385
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,260
I used it to clean the glass.

386
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,620
And my Devil's Ivy.

387
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,220
This,

388
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,900
you don't have to thank me at all.

389
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,740
It's me

390
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,900
who saved its dry soul.

391
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,220
I'll pour more water on your Devil's Ivy

392
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,300
when I get off work tonight.

393
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,340
No, no, no.

394
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,940
Mr. Lai Jr.

395
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,340
No, no, no.

396
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
You are so powerful.

397
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,740
I,

398
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,860
I can see that

399
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,860
you are really

400
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,940
not fit for cleaning at all.

401
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,060
I think

402
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,500
cleaning is really

403
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,300
not suitable for you.

404
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,140
Well,

405
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,140
all of us will go to find Mr. Lai

406
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,140
and intercede for you.

407
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,300
And ask him to

408
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,060
waive your punishment for this month.

409
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,900
What do you think?

410
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,220
Bro,

411
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,859
I'm so moved.

412
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,780
We're all good friends.

413
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,650
Whose yogurt?

414
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,980
Mine.

415
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,060
I don't like it.

416
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,850
Give you.

417
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,860
Why?

418
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,180
Because I think

419
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,500
there is a little bit of truth

420
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,940
in what you said yesterday.

421
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,580
It was hard last night?

422
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
It's all my job.

423
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
If it was my sister,

424
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,420
she would have solved it.

425
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,940
And I don't want to slow you down.

426
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,420
I've read the new script.

427
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,540
It's good.

428
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,660
You did a great job.

429
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,340
It's not all because of me.

430
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,180
The main reason is that Qin Yanfei wrote well.

431
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,020
Although he is a playful person at ordinary times,

432
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,660
he is very reliable

433
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,740
at work.

434
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,180
You two are so close

435
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,660
and you slept together last night.

436
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,540
It was late when I finished writing the script last night,

437
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,300
so I slept in his room.

438
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm used to it.

439
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,980
Be used to it?

440
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,220
How can you get used to this kind of thing?

441
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,460
Why are you so loud?

442
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,220
Are you angry?

443
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,860
I have nothing to do with him...

444
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,050
Is,

445
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,340
is he jealous?

446
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,700
Great.

447
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
The script is well revised this time.

448
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,100
Right?

449
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,820
It's good.

450
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,060
Why didn't Mr. Qin come?

451
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,980
He has stayed up for several days

452
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,020
and he is sleeping at home now.

453
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,740
OK, OK, OK.

454
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,050
Let's eat first.

455
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,660
OK.

456
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,820
It's okay.

457
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,700
Director Wang.

458
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,220
Qingyan.

459
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,500
How am I going to play the next scene?

460
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,060
There are a few feelings that I don't quite understand.

461
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,820
Which one?

462
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,460
This one.

463
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,340
This scene is about

464
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,700
Su Nianxue's master

465
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,500
arranging her

466
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,010
to go on a blind date with another man.

467
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,100
Then Mingjue must be jealous

468
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,460
when he knows about it.

469
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,740
He will spoil the blind date

470
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,580
and confess his love to Su Nianxue at the same time.

471
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,340
Do you understand?

472
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,900
So I think emotion is progressive.

473
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,220
The kind of incremental emotions,

474
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,820
you know?

475
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
You have to rein in a little at first,

476
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,940
and then break out.

477
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,340
Blind date?

478
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,700
Jealousy?

479
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,890
Confession?

480
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,140
Think about it,

481
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,620
think about it.

482
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,020
Have a try again.

483
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,180
You eat scallops?

484
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,810
What's wrong?

485
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,700
I love scallops.

486
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,860
Do you have any problems?

487
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,500
Xiaoran,

488
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,210
you're here.

489
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,620
Mr. Chen is looking for you.

490
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,740
Your neck?

491
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,730
Don't make a fuss.

492
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm just allergic to scallops.

493
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,150
[The Bauhinia]

494
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,450
Her personality changed.

495
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,940
What bad luck,

496
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
ran into a copycat early in the morning.

497
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
How can the faint candlelight

498
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,020
compete with the bright moon?

499
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,220
This dress is just like

500
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,540
being tailored for you.

501
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,460
I don't deserve it.

502
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,980
Her temper changed as well.

503
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,980
Xiaoran,

504
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,140
could you bring me the high heels?

505
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Can allergies also change?

506
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Are you suspicious of Bi Xiaoran?

507
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,540
What about the driver?

508
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,300
What do you what to do?

509
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,060
It's been so long.

510
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,380
Find a way to contact him for me.

511
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,540
Be careful.

512
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,620
Don't let anything go wrong.

513
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,540
And,

514
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,500
ask Tian Daren out.

515
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,940
Qingyan,

516
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,620
go ahead.

517
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,380
What do you want this time?

518
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,100
This time I'm the one to tell you something.

519
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,500
Impossible.

520
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,810
There's no news that

521
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,780
I don't know.

522
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,420
It's not clear now.

523
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,820
I need you to check out that

524
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,420
the itinerary of Bi Xiaoran

525
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,500
on the day of negotiations between Global Picture and Lemeng.

526
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,900
And,

527
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,980
pay special attention to

528
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,060
whether there was any car accident

529
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,700
near her house that day.

530
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,340
I see.

531
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,580
I'll give you a message

532
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,420
in three days.

533
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,460
Mr. Lai,

534
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,740
I'm going out.

535
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,460
Where are you going?

536
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,500
Date.

537
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,730
Date?

538
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,900
Yes.

539
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,250
It's all because of Qin Yanfei,

540
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,420
the nosy guy.

541
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,460
He insisted on introducing a boyfriend to me.

542
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,500
I even dressed up.

543
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,420
Do I look good?

544
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,100
Do you think I should go?

545
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,140
Of course,

546
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,300
of course you should go there.

547
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,580
This dress is a little longer.

548
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
It would be better if it were shorter.

549
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,140
What? It's long?

550
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
If he likes me,

551
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,540
how would he allow me to dress like this

552
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,980
to meet another man?

553
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,300
Let's go.

554
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,660
Where?

555
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,740
I'll take you there.

556
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,340
What to do?

557
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,180
I don't have a date at all.

558
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,740
Oh my god.

559
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,500
Mr. Lai,

560
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,900
you just rest at home.

561
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,860
There's no need to bother you with such a trifle.

562
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,700
I'll take a taxi.

563
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,540
It's okay.

564
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,580
I'll drive you there.

565
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,380
Ah.

566
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,540
Where are you to meet?

567
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,820
We...

568
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,140
we'll meet at...

569
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,540
at where?

570
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,610
Uh.

571
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,380
Erxianqiao.

572
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,890
Erxianqiao?

573
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
