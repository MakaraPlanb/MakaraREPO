What are you doing?

166
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,500
I didn't tell

167
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
that you have big feet.

168
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,540
Your feet must be size 40.

169
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Are you blind?

170
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,180
My feet are size 36!

171
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,060
It must be size 40!

172
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,300
I could fit into it.

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,180
Take it off!

174
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,140
Give me the other one.

175
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Take it off!

176
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,380
My shoe!

177
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,180
This...

178
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,780
this shoe's quality

179
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,860
is really bad.

180
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,610

The current "Bi Xiaoran" is not the real one,

573
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,660
it's her twin sister.

574
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,820
What should we do?

575
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,020
Don't panic.

576
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,380
Contact the poster first.

577
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,660
I've sent him

578
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,540
a lot of messages.

579
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,460
He didn't reply to me.

580
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,650
[Make an offer if it's true.]

581
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
Will this work?

582
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,580
If he doesn't reply today

583
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,180
I'll ask Xiao He to check tomorrow.

584
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,460
He replied!

585
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,130
[50,000 yuan]

586
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,380
I...

587
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,980
Why am I so nervous?

588
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,220
Don't force yourself.

589
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,340
You don't have to

590
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,180
participate this time.

591
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,100
Just leave it to me.

592
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,170
It can't be.

593
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,340
I can't chicken out.

594
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,020
I have to fight for my sister.

595
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
And fight for you.

596
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Let me do it.

597
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,700
Fine.

598
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm Bi Xiaoran.

599
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm Bi Xiaoran.

600
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,620
I'll be Bi Xiaoran even if they beat me to death.

601
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
For the sake of safety,

602
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,770
I will stop

603
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,740
this live broadcast.

604
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,460
What?

605
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,180
Why?

606
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,500
You don't have to stop it.

607
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,900
I want it

608
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,780
to be a big scene.

609
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,060
Do you see this clear?

610
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,140
Is this enough for you?

611
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,940
You can't spread rumors.

612
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,540
There will be consequences

613
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,900
by saying this kind of thing.

614
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,660
She's literally making it up.

615
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,860
As you can see,

616
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,850
the person who's

617
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,700
lying in bed is my younger sister,

618
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,380
Jiang Lili.

619
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,980
I didn't reveal the identity of us before

620
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,420
in order to protect

621
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,300
my twin sister.

622
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
On the day of signing the contract,

623
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,250
I forgot to bring the important file,

624
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,060
so I asked my sister to

625
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,410
send it to me by driving a car.

626
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,380
I didn't expect this to happen.

627
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
I'm the one who made her suffer from it.

628
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,340
She's still

629
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,780
lying in a hospital bed.

630
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,260
Now you are the real Bi Xiaoran,

631
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,340
but you weren't before.

632
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,700
She had a severe car accident,

633
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,140
and her legs were badly damaged.

634
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,060
She's impossible to recover this fast.

635
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,540
If you're okay,

636
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,220
just stand up.

637
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,340
Didn't I make it

638
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,980
clear enough?

639
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,500
A mere verbal statement is no guarantee.

640
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,540
I don't buy your story.

641
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,130
How did this happen?

642
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,580
-It's har to say. -That's right.

643
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
Lady Qingyan is causing trouble deliberately,

644
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
and spreading the rumors all around.

645
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,700
We will get to the bottom of this.

646
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,300
Not let me go so easily?

647
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,930
I think you're feeling guilty.

648
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,620
I don't understand.

649
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,180
Why does Miss Ren have to push so hard?

650
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,780
You have to hit a wall

651
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,900
to stop your behaviors, huh?

652
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,460
Thank you for your concern about this car accident.

653
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,340
The hit-and-run driver has been arrested.

654
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,860
Sooner or later, we'll know

655
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,620
who's behind this.

656
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,700
There's just one thing that I don't understand.

657
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,380
Miss Ren,

658
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,180
Why do you know so much about the details

659
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,300
of this car accident?

660
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,660
She must have something to do with it.

661
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,140
That's right.

662
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,900
Exactly.

663
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,860
How did she know?

664
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,980
Excuse me.

665
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
Make way.

666
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,340
Police!

667
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,540
-The police is coming. -Police?

668
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,340
Police!

669
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,380
It's the police.

670
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,100
Miss Ren, please come with us.

671
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,060
Officer,

672
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,450
is there any misunderstanding?

673
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,900
It must be some kind of misunderstanding.

674
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,900
[The project progress of The Journey of the Youth]

675
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,900
You kept the whole thing

676
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,180
a secret from me!

677
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,500
You made up a story that Bi Xiaoran

678
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,660
was on a business trip in Australia.

679
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,540
Jiangjiang.

680
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm so disappointed in you.

681
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,330
Really disappointed.

682
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm sorry.

683
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,700
It's my fault.

684
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,260
I was forced to do it.

685
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Next time,

686
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,380
I'll be the first to tell you.

687
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,220
Next time?

688
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,100
Don't do it ever again!

689
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,730
Or I'll smack you!

690
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,300
Lili did a good job

691
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,220
on this matter.

692
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,860
Do you hear that?

693
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,380
My sister complimented me.

694
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,660
I showed my resourcefulness in an emergency.

695
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,780
Qin Yanfei,

696
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,460
you just don't see the big picture.

697
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,100
It's not even a good job.

698
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,740
This whole thing between you and her

699
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,130
is a ticking time bomb!

700
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,020
If anyone finds it out,

701
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,940
it's over for both of you.

702
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,490
It won't be.

703
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,260
Three days ago,

704
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,860
I found the sidekick of Tian Daren.

705
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,220
Then I knew Ren Qingyan's trick.

706
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,500
Besides, in the nick of time,

707
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,820
my sister woke up.

708
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,650
What does that mean?

709
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,140
That means I'm the God's favorite.

710
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,420
I'm the God's daughter.

711
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,780
And you,

712
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,580
why did you just wake up and go to the site?

713
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,340
And you insisted on standing up.

714
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,820
What if the condition gets worse?

715
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,020
My legs are fine.

716
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,220
It's just a matter of time for me to recover.

717
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,740
Besides, under that circumstance,

718
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,820
if I didn't stand up,

719
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
how could I possibly stop the rumors?

720
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,380
But...

721
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
Make way.

722
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,380
Sister.

723
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
Do you want to eat something?

724
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,340
Do you want to drink something?

725
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,690
Or do you want to do something?

726
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,820
You finally grow up.

727
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,900
I owe you a lot

728
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,980
for your help these days.

729
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,690
Thank you.

730
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,700
You got hurt because of me.

731
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,890
I should help you.

732
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,500
I have to help you more, naturally.

733
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,700
Then you should go home and get some rest.

734
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,570
I'll take care

735
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,500
of the rest.

736
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,380
No!

737
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,580
The doctor said,

738
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,220
if you don't follow the orders,

739
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,940
you'll be living on the wheelchair

740
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,140
for the rest of your life.

741
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,020
You need to rest more due to your injury.

742
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,820
During this period of time,

743
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,940
let Lili continue to do your work.

744
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,020
Don't worry, sister.

745
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,180
I'm not who I used to be.

746
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,140
I'm not a noob anymore.

747
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,660
And I won't

748
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,980
disgrace you anymore.

749
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,660
Right.

750
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,580
Lili is now familiar with

751
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,900
the company's business.

752
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,260
You don't have to worry about work.

753
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,380
Then, Ding Dong,

754
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,980
you should keep an eye on her during this time.

755
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,100
Lili still has something

756
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,980
to learn about.

757
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,860
Keep an eye on her.

758
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,260
Don't worry, Xiaoran.

759
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,860
I will.

760
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,300
Ren Qingyan is suspected of involvement

761
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,120
[Big news happened at the Lemeng Night yesterday]

762
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,500
in the car accident of Bi Xiaoran's twin sister.

763
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,850
Big news!

764
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,410
[Ren Qingyan must gone crazy after acting in so many shows]

765
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,340
[Switch identity? What a bullshit.]

766
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,630
[This is the classic sign of being delusional, hope she can go to the hospital ASAP]

767
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,600
[LMAO. She went for wool and came home shorn, Xiaoran is incredible!]

768
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,710
[It's a great loss for the entertainment industry that Ren Qingyan is not a script writer.]

769
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,260
This is called, "What goes around comes around!"

770
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,660
She's done.

771
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,060
Now the case of Ren Qingyan is closed.

772
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,890
Also, that third wheel, Qin Yanfei

773
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,570
finally left the house.

774
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,620
Now it's finally only him and me.

775
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,250
We're finally back together again!

776
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,500
What a great

777
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,900
and happy day.

778
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,660
We must celebrate it!
